305/28840	Do not forget that I have been five years in the Bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a	44.06764602661133
306/28840	As for me I play my game squarely fairly and above board as I always	277.1989440917969
307/28840	Are you one of us Monsieur de Rochefort   I am very desirous of being so my lord but I am totally in the dark about	23.526212692260742
308/28840	In the Bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort I am of Monsieur de Bassompierres	93.85928344726562
309/28840	Is he still one of the seventeen peers of France   He is dead sir a great	90.8508529663086
310/28840	His devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are	162.74871826171875
311/28840	I think so forsooth said Rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the Bast	64.66854095458984
312/28840	However there are plenty in the world but you dont look in the right direction for them my	73.54061126708984
313/28840	Ah my dear Monsieur de Rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal Ah he was a great	32.5340690612793
314/28840	Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson   I never you know you may say anything to	48.72251892089844
315/28840	I try to be beloved not	309.027099609375
316/28840	Well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says Like master like	152.6194305419922
317/28840	Pray what does that mean   It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of	60.419918060302734
318/28840	But those men you speak of said Mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing Rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against	103.7547836303711
319/28840	No in that case they would have met with more fitting	83.1933822631836
320/28840	They had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking	123.31999969482422
321/28840	Ah said Mazarin with admirable suavity could I but find such men   My lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as I describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by	131.63746643066406
322/28840	Who is it   It is Monsieur dArtagn	8.427075386047363
323/28840	That Gascon cried Mazarin with well acted	106.78459167480469
324/28840	That Gascon has saved a queen and made Monsieur de Richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only a ty	76.79608154296875
325/28840	Really   It is as I have the honor of telling it to your excell	15.056609153747559
326/28840	Tell me a little about it my dear Monsieur de Roche	18.70235824584961
327/28840	That is somewhat difficult my lord said Rochefort with a	35.573177337646484
328/28840	Then he will tell it me	194.70152282714844
329/28840	Why do you doubt it   Because the secret does not belong to him because as I have told you it has to do with a great	42.72219467163086
330/28840	And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that   No my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just	83.65491485595703
331/28840	And were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united   As if they had been one manas if their four hearts had pulsated in one	163.12359619140625
332/28840	You pique my curiosity dear Rochefort pray tell me the whole	136.69129943847656
333/28840	That is impossible but I will tell you a true story my	54.322635650634766
334/28840	Pray do so I delight in stories cried the	398.25860595703125
335/28840	Listen then returned Rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinals	68.73574829101562
336/28840	Once upon a time there lived a queena powerful monarchwho reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe and a minister and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too	160.4413604736328
337/28840	Do not try my lord you cannot guess who it is all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen re	112.33153533935547
338/28840	There came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like	79.02255249023438
339/28840	As these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queens appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take	99.20793914794922
340/28840	There is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond	94.23176574707031
341/28840	This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjectsfallen from her high	230.2710723876953
342/28840	Indeed   Well my lord four men resolved to save	48.90929412841797
343/28840	These four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power they were not even	245.7908172607422
344/28840	They were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted	107.16143798828125
345/28840	The minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their	225.701171875
346/28840	Three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop	159.40821838378906
347/28840	He crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the	73.27951049804688
348/28840	What do you think of that exploit my lord   It is magnificent said Mazarin thought	23.065080642700195
349/28840	Well I know of ten such	266.8820495605469
350/28840	You have nothing more to ask of me my lord said Roche	26.55088233947754
351/28840	And you say that Monsieur dArtagnan was one of those four men   He led the	20.43415641784668
352/28840	And who were the others   I leave it to Monsieur dArtagnan to name them my	26.073091506958008
353/28840	They were his friends and not	164.06007385253906
354/28840	He alone would have any influence with them I do not even know them under their true	101.39901733398438
355/28840	You suspect me Monsieur de Rochefort I want him and you and all to aid	48.94920349121094
356/28840	Begin with me my lord for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to ones	89.71485900878906
357/28840	You my dear Monsieur de Rochefort shall have the post of confidence you shall go to Vincennes where Monsieur de Beaufort is confined you will guard him well for	25.10959815979004
358/28840	Well what is the matter   The matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said Rochefort shaking his head with an air of	24.366928100585938
359/28840	What impossible And why is it impossible   Because Monsieur de Beaufort is one of my friends or rather I am one of	18.877944946289062
360/28840	Have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen   Since then Monsieur de Beaufort has become an enemy of the	28.232797622680664
361/28840	That may be my lord but since I am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and I cannot accept your	96.37307739257812
362/28840	This then is what you call devotion I congratulate	131.49624633789062
363/28840	Your devotion does not commit you too far Monsieur de Roche	36.89945602416992
364/28840	And then my lord continued Rochefort you understand that to emerge from the Bastile in order to enter Vincennes is only to change ones	69.43372344970703
365/28840	Say at once that you are on the side of Monsieur de Beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said Maz	28.63826560974121
366/28840	My lord I have been so long shut up that I am only of one partyI am for fresh	79.33358764648438
367/28840	Employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high	110.30207824707031
368/28840	My dear Monsieur de Rochefort Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the phoenix but your strength fails	46.84221267700195
369/28840	Believe me you ought now to take a	297.171875
370/28840	Here   You decide then nothing about me my lord   On the contrary I have come to a	31.91280174255371
371/28840	Call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in a low	49.53056716918945
372/28840	Mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he	307.24029541015625
373/28840	I see my lord I am to be taken back to the Bast	25.91608428955078
374/28840	I shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ	59.74613952636719
375/28840	You the friend of my greatest foes Dont suppose that you are the only person who can serve me Monsieur de Roche	41.05205535888672
376/28840	I shall find many men as able as you	120.89603424072266
377/28840	I wish you may my lord replied De Roche	44.972320556640625
378/28840	He was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the antechamber where DArtagnan was	28.112600326538086
379/28840	In the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his	61.18433380126953

384/28840	This is a detail preserved to us by Brien	193.48550415039062
385/28840	He now determined not to begin the game with DArtagnan till he knew completely all his adversarys	115.83317565917969

388/28840	Bernouin took up a candlestick and led the	48.58667755126953
389/28840	There was a secret communication between the cardinals apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor Mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit Anne of	73.13307189941406
390/28840	This secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais	56.038509368896484
391/28840	Anne reclining in a large easychair her head supported by her hand her elbow resting on a table was looking at her son who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with	71.47250366210938
392/28840	This celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with	575.1336059570312
393/28840	It was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or	159.85214233398438
394/28840	When Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexanders feats of arms frowned and looked at his	81.47212219238281
395/28840	Why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience   Anne colored	271.1958923339844
396/28840	The prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the	135.74945068359375
397/28840	But Richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious	156.8148193359375
398/28840	How can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did You were too young to know about such	51.17298126220703
399/28840	I do not remember what he did but I have inquired and I have been told all about	35.25171661376953
400/28840	And who told you about it asked Anne of Austria with a movement of impat	27.588388442993164
401/28840	I know that I ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if I do I shall learn nothing	138.427001953125
402/28840	The king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that Mazarin might be obliged to stand	98.69792175292969
403/28840	Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful	2606.72509765625
404/28840	They explained what had occurred that	195.585693359375
405/28840	He bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy Louis	97.94129180908203
406/28840	had entertained toward Mazarin and he endeavored to receive the ministers homage with civ	71.68008422851562
407/28840	Anne of Austria sought to read in Mazarins face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had	104.9468765258789
408/28840	The minister made a slight sign with his head whereupon the queen said to Madame Beauvais   It is time for the king to go to bed call Laport	64.87825775146484
409/28840	The queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times Louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with	76.00714111328125
410/28840	In a few minutes Laporte came into the	25.407344818115234
411/28840	The child went directly to him without kissing his	241.63751220703125
412/28840	Well Louis said Anne why do you not kiss me   I thought you were angry with me madame you sent me	47.938720703125
413/28840	I do not send you away but you have had the smallpox and I am afraid that sitting up late may tire	104.55473327636719
414/28840	You had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace today to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to	90.51762390136719
415/28840	Sire interposed Laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle   To any one Laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one except Manc	65.75244903564453
416/28840	Now Mancini was a nephew of Mazarins and was as much hated by Louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the	148.3837890625
417/28840	And the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the	46.9972038269043
418/28840	Good said Mazarin I am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissim	20.399871826171875
419/28840	Why do you say that asked the queen almost timid	50.176361083984375
420/28840	Why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no	77.35917663574219
421/28840	Besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for	96.99563598632812
422/28840	That however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as I am to that of your	72.8026351928711
423/28840	I ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to	67.03976440429688
424/28840	But continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important	89.63233184814453
425/28840	What is it then   Mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his count	44.514984130859375
426/28840	It is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to	68.66878509521484
427/28840	Why cried the queen how is that   Because as they say in the opera of Thisbe The whole world conspires to break our	95.34498596191406

465/28840	Tell me your wishes and I will comply with	76.77590942382812
466/28840	Well madame said Mazarin bowing I desire that you give me a share in your friends as I have shared with you the little industry and talent that Heaven has given	58.14484786987305
467/28840	The circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act	74.60981750488281
468/28840	I thought that we were finally quit of Monsieur de Beau	35.143516540527344
469/28840	Yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still	210.9013214111328
470/28840	There is however a proverb current in France relating to water which is	363.3301086425781

472/28840	There is the Prince de Condé   The hero of Roc	24.347618103027344
473/28840	Do you think of him   Yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in Italy next after Monsieur de Condé comes the Duke of	65.94558715820312
474/28840	But he is mistaken I shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling	113.4278335571289
475/28840	Anne blushed and buried her face in her	69.64617156982422
476/28840	What am I to do she said bowed down beneath the voice of her	174.45225524902344
477/28840	Endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the Channel in spite of Monsieur de Richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to	77.23080444335938
478/28840	Anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful You are insulting me she	75.01509857177734
479/28840	I wish continued Mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut I wish in fact that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your	118.35762023925781
480/28840	I thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all I tell you   Madame I do not ask you to tell me said Mazarin astounded by this returning	62.32102966308594
481/28840	I will tell you all replied	38.02836608886719
482/28840	Listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my lifemy honor   Ah you confess it exclaimed Maz	182.8673095703125

484/28840	What relics are those by which you swear asked Mazarin	248.7399444580078
485/28840	The queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the	228.74920654296875
486/28840	Open sir she said and look for	114.34783172607422
487/28840	Mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his	265.0320129394531
488/28840	What are these things replied Anne with queenlike dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still	326.30133056640625
489/28840	These two letters are the only ones I ever wrote to	113.77099609375
490/28840	This knife is the knife with which Felton stabbed	276.82708740234375
491/28840	Read the letters and see if I have lied or spoken the	153.74090576171875
492/28840	But Mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying Buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by Laporte to the	94.88939666748047
493/28840	The blade was red for the blood had become rust after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary	110.12061309814453
494/28840	It is well madame I believe your	82.50961303710938
495/28840	No no read exclaimed the queen indignantly read I command you for I am resolved that everything shall be finished tonight and never will I recur to this subject	215.18397521972656
496/28840	Do you think she said with a ghastly smile that I shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations   Mazarin overcome by this determination read the two	94.62615203857422
497/28840	In one the queen asked for the ornaments back	79.54908752441406
498/28840	This letter had been conveyed by DArtagnan and had arrived in	38.95680236816406
499/28840	The other was that which Laporte had placed in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated that communication had arrived too	62.133888244628906
500/28840	It is well madame said Mazarin nothing can gainsay such	101.68647766113281
501/28840	As she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her	69.51253509521484
502/28840	It appears she resumed that he sold ithe sold it in order to save me another timeto be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his dangerhe sold it to Monsieur des Essarts on whose finger I remarked	78.0967025756836
503/28840	I bought it from him but it belongs to DArtagn	28.672958374023438
504/28840	Give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him	88.77549743652344
505/28840	And now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me   Nothingthe cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory mannerexcept to beg of you to forgive my unworthy	207.923583984375
506/28840	I love you so tenderly that I cannot help being jealous even of the	64.39881896972656
507/28840	A smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the	86.04727935791016
508/28840	Since you have no further interrogations to make leave me I beseech you she	51.95698547363281
509/28840	I wish after such a scene to be	109.8120346069336
510/28840	Do you permit me to return   Yes	42.89387130737305
511/28840	The cardinal took the queens hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his	43.07743453979492
512/28840	Scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her sons room and inquired from Laporte if the king was in	69.08250427246094
513/28840	Laporte pointed to the child who was	140.8976593017578
514/28840	Meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking Bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left	48.86362838745117
515/28840	When he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antech	22.964658737182617
516/28840	There DArtagnan was asleep upon a	32.48238754272461
517/28840	The cardinal went up to him and touched his	75.60795593261719
518/28840	DArtagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldier under	109.99911499023438
519/28840	Who calls me   I said Mazarin with his most smiling	60.6396484375
520/28840	I ask pardon of your eminence said DArtagnan but I was so fatigued   Dont ask my pardon monsieur said Mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my	19.23153305053711

523/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable	22.09469223022461
524/28840	Possibly thought DArtagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for Mazarins	72.97366333007812
525/28840	Well continued Mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your val	68.88369750976562
526/28840	There was a sudden gleam of joy in the officers eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of Mazarins	94.80070495605469
527/28840	Order my lord he said I am ready to obey your em	19.172998428344727
528/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last	54.29905700683594
529/28840	Your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my	107.40621948242188
530/28840	It is true I fought with tolerable	184.74888610839844
531/28840	I dont speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said Mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by	61.744144439697266
532/28840	Well you do not reply resumed Maz	72.8459701538086
533/28840	I am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you	68.15968322753906
534/28840	I speak of the adventureEh you know well what I	51.7054328918457
535/28840	Alas no my lord replied DArtagnan	34.058692932128906
536/28840	I speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen of the ornaments of the journey you made with three of your	63.403011322021484
537/28840	Aha thought the Gascon is this a snare or not Let me be on my	121.45622253417969
538/28840	And he assumed a look of stupidity which Mendori or Bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have env	118.46925354003906
539/28840	Bravo cried Mazarin they told me that you were the man I	88.87490844726562
540/28840	Come let us see what you will do for	19.413087844848633
541/28840	Everything that your eminence may please to command me was the	45.994728088378906
542/28840	You will do for me what you have done for the queen   Certainly DArtagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak	24.86929702758789
543/28840	Hes not more cunning than De Richelieu was Devil take him Then he said aloud   The queen my lord I dont	73.13540649414062
544/28840	You dont comprehend that I want you and your three friends to be of use to me   Which of my friends my lord   Your three friendsthe friends of former	72.77403259277344
545/28840	Of former days my lord In former days I had not only three friends I had thirty at twoandtwenty one calls every man ones	132.8858642578125
546/28840	Well sir returned Mazarin prudence is a fine thing but today you might regret having been too	85.12935638427734
547/28840	My lord Pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their	171.85838317871094
548/28840	But you have been silent for twenty years	40.48613739013672
549/28840	Speak now the queen herself releases you from your	240.2676239013672
550/28840	The queen said DArtagnan with an astonishment which this time was not	50.97283935546875
551/28840	Yes the queen And as a proof of what I say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you	68.37449645996094
552/28840	I remember well that diamond which belonged to the	84.21508026123047
553/28840	You see then that I speak to you in the queens	74.29169464111328
554/28840	Answer me without acting as if you were on the stage your interests are concerned in your so	135.50253295898438
555/28840	Faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has so long forgotten	28.01264762878418
556/28840	We need only a week to amend all	153.44488525390625
557/28840	Come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends   I do not know my	25.750213623046875
558/28840	We have parted company this long time all three have left the	358.5223388671875
559/28840	Where can you find them then   Wherever they are thats my	105.28913116455078
560/28840	Well now what are your conditions if I employ you   Money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will	70.15229797363281
561/28840	I remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which I was obliged to sell we should have remained on the	94.69263458251953
562/28840	The devil he does Money and a large sum said Maz	74.06723022460938
563/28840	Pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury   Do then as I did my	59.04621887207031
564/28840	Trust me dont let us try to do things	69.56317138671875
565/28840	Great undertakings come poorly off with paltry	138.62042236328125
566/28840	Well returned Mazarin we will satisfy	54.66061782836914
567/28840	Richelieu thought DArtagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in	32.271240234375
568/28840	You will then be at my service asked Maz	42.1023063659668
569/28840	But if they refuse can I count on you   I have never accomplished anything alone said DArtagnan shaking his	31.766223907470703
570/28840	What shall I say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence   You know them better than	53.38573455810547
571/28840	Adapt your promises to their respective	299.080322265625
572/28840	What shall I promise   That if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be	89.51461791992188
573/28840	But what are we to do   Make your mind easy when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what I require from you wait till that time arrives and find out your	72.44573974609375
574/28840	My lord perhaps they are not in	102.68183898925781
575/28840	It is even probable that I shall have to make a	47.450706481933594
576/28840	I am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost	127.71637725830078
577/28840	My intention said Mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant	128.95668029785156
578/28840	Still my lord I cant travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and I cant travel on my savings for in my twentytwo years of service I have accumulated nothing but	90.01593017578125
579/28840	If these are Spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought DArtagnan we shall yet be able to do business	93.31084442138672
580/28840	He saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense	75.45104217529297
581/28840	Well then all is settled you are to set off said the	80.06602478027344
582/28840	Younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family	169.9102020263672
583/28840	These Gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the Italians in effron	101.45259857177734
584/28840	At all events answered DArtagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals they beat them when they draw their	56.81918716430664
585/28840	He then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of	96.07098388671875
586/28840	Crown pieces onlysilver pieces I suspected	1688.7020263671875
587/28840	Ah Mazarin Mazarin thou hast no confidence in me so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it   Meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great	88.78184509277344
588/28840	In the meantime DArtagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne where he lived at the Hotel de la Chev	12.15665340423584
589/28840	We will explain in a few words how DArtagnan had been led to choose that place of	59.9962272644043
590/28840	Years have elapsed many events have happened alas since in our romance of The Three Musketeers we took leave of DArtagnan at	124.58341979980469
591/28840	DArtagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to	39.83674240112305
592/28840	So long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his	64.30121612548828
593/28840	He was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of	119.87841796875
594/28840	Athos imparted to him his greatness of soul Porthos his enthusiasm Aramis his	163.3848419189453
595/28840	Had DArtagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior	48.57769012451172
596/28840	Athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near Blois Porthos the second to marry an attorneys wife and lastly Aramis the third to take orders and become an abb	64.55848693847656
597/28840	From that day DArtagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from	108.63188934326172
598/28840	Notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers DArtagnan felt completely	90.10065460205078
599/28840	For a time the delightful remembrance of Madame Bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees eff	185.7313690185547
600/28840	A garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly DArtagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became I know not how in the present age one would express it a typical	116.71116638183594
601/28840	These important advantages DArtagnan found to his own taste in the Rue Tiquetonne at the sign of the	27.278858184814453
602/28840	He was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken	193.78659057617188
603/28840	Bigamy my dear Come now you dont really wish it   But he is dead I am sure of	48.725337982177734
604/28840	He was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us	167.8701629638672
605/28840	All right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so	91.78520965576172
606/28840	Peste my darling another way of getting	291.8253479003906
607/28840	So you refuse my request   To be sure I dofuriously   The pretty landlady was	53.635154724121094
608/28840	She would have taken DArtagnan not only as her husband but as her God he was so handsome and had so fierce a	60.164737701416016
609/28840	Then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of FrancheCom	269.8974304199219
610/28840	DArtagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to	46.61703109741211
611/28840	There were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithfulall of course on the part of the host	161.78834533691406
612/28840	DArtagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his	88.80491638183594
613/28840	As to that we know DArtagnans courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of	64.21842193603516
614/28840	He had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give	108.36239624023438
615/28840	One believes readily what he wishes to	447.66363525390625
616/28840	Now in the army from the divisiongenerals who desire the death of the generalinchief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some ones	162.2963104248047
617/28840	But DArtagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like	23.17141342163086
618/28840	After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battlefield the cool freshness of the night brought him to	85.88860321044922
619/28840	He gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in	111.27294158935547
620/28840	He was petted tended cured and one fine morning in better health than ever before he set out for	249.2069854736328
621/28840	Once in France he turned his course toward Paris and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiqueton	51.214027404785156
622/28840	But DArtagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the	73.73735046386719
623/28840	So much the worse and so much the better   It need not be said that DArtagnan was still thinking of the	22.9042911529541
624/28840	He made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a	141.5908966064453
625/28840	Monsieur has returned then   Of course naively replied the	49.98311233520508
626/28840	If I had any money said DArtagnan to himself I would go away but I have	24.56625747680664
627/28840	I must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune appar	122.73477172851562
628/28840	Is that monsieur said DArtagnan to	6.708937644958496
629/28840	Oh oh he has grown a good deal it seems to	71.49381256103516
630/28840	And he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous	132.2778778076172
631/28840	The hostess as she entered saw DArtagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon DArtagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tender	55.92674255371094
632/28840	The Swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned	35.9212532043457
633/28840	Ah it is you monsieur What do you want of me she asked in great	31.551616668701172
634/28840	Is monsieur your cousin Is monsieur your brother said DArtagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was	28.76909065246582
635/28840	And without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the Helvetian who received him with great cold	55.85608673095703
636/28840	Monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gas	44.531822204589844
637/28840	Your husband then is at last dead   How does that concern you replied the	77.53018951416016
638/28840	It concerns me much said DArtagnan since you cannot marry madame without my consent and since   And since asked the	54.8819580078125
639/28840	And sinceI do not give it said the musket	50.915977478027344
640/28840	The Swiss became as purple as a pe	552.7224731445312
641/28840	He wore his elegant uniform DArtagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak the Swiss was six feet high DArtagnan was hardly more than five the Swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded DArtagnan as an	65.98395538330078
642/28840	Will you go away from here demanded the Swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously	102.22251892089844
643/28840	Some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so	92.42170715332031
644/28840	DArtagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction   Stay you where you are and dont you stir or I will pull this ear	112.63919830322266
645/28840	As for you illustrious descendant of William Tell you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me and go out quickly to another	213.65023803710938
646/28840	And why   Ah very well said DArtagnan I see that you understand	19.348995208740234
647/28840	Come then and take a turn with me and I will	57.53242111206055
648/28840	The hostess who knew DArtagnans skill with the sword began to weep and tear her	69.534912109375
649/28840	DArtagnan turned toward her saying Then send him away mad	59.9760627746582
650/28840	It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of	63.54883575439453
651/28840	DArtagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the Swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his	85.66654205322266
652/28840	Then you will lie here said DArtagn	26.69693374633789
653/28840	It is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen	43.47084045410156
654/28840	With these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his	52.70890426635742
655/28840	He had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all	291.4104309082031
656/28840	The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold but suddenly feebleness occasioned by loss of blood obliged him to sit	165.3487091064453
657/28840	There said DArtagnan what did I tell you Fortunately you wont be laid up more than a	55.587223052978516
658/28840	Remain here and I will send you your clothes by the	107.7466812133789
659/28840	Goodby Oh by the way youd better take lodging in the Rue Montorgueil at the Chat Qui Pel	290.423583984375
660/28840	You will be well fed there if the hostess remains the	81.93812561035156
661/28840	Thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the Swiss the things that belonged to	100.46039581298828
662/28840	The boy found him sitting where DArtagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his	52.25160598754883
663/28840	The boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for DArtagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve lab	91.42649841308594
664/28840	But when he was alone with the hostess he said Now pretty Madeleine you know the difference between a Swiss and a	53.517276763916016
665/28840	As for you you have acted like a barm	196.80966186523438
666/28840	So much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my	62.33621597290039
667/28840	I have driven away the Swiss to humiliate you but I shall lodge here no	100.95155334472656
668/28840	I will not sleep where I must	69.18014526367188
669/28840	Ho there boy Have my valise carried to the Muid dAmour Rue des Bourdonna	562.6886596679688
670/28840	In saying these words DArtagnan appeared at the same time majestic and g	39.034156799316406
671/28840	The hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet	114.758056640625
672/28840	What more need be said The spit turned the stove roared the pretty Madeleine wept DArtagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and	104.74555206298828
673/28840	He pardoned and having pardoned he	111.28907012939453
674/28840	And this explains how DArtagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne at the Hotel de la Chev	12.943346977233887
675/28840	DArtagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying Mazarins bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the ministers finger that	72.4014663696289
676/28840	Then I should like to have three sons I should make the first a nobleman like Athos the second a good soldier like Porthos the third an excellent abbé like Aram	55.727088928222656
677/28840	Faith that would be a far better life than I lead now but Monsieur Mazarin is a mean wretch who wont dispossess himself of his diamond in my	123.25363159179688
678/28840	On entering the Rue Tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the	48.11201095581055
679/28840	Oho said he is the hotel on fire On approaching the hotel of the Roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was	114.57193756103516
680/28840	The people were shouting and running about with	389.03887939453125
681/28840	By the light of one of these torches DArtagnan perceived men in	51.16725540161133
682/28840	In his youth DArtagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hotheaded propensities besides he had the cardinals hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a	75.8224868774414
683/28840	There he found Madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good Burg	74.19734191894531
684/28840	He took his key and candle and went upstairs to his	74.05189514160156
685/28840	He had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the	118.20606994628906
686/28840	His first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to	110.68696594238281
687/28840	Not to reflect on what had passed as one might	187.61683654785156
688/28840	No DArtagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper	85.76909637451172
689/28840	He was hungry he supped he went to	131.54653930664062
690/28840	Neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with	126.1177978515625
691/28840	In the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of	141.84640502929688
692/28840	It was long since he had any reason for his mornings inspiration but he always slept all night	107.41217041015625
693/28840	At daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his	119.13874053955078
694/28840	In 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal I received a letter from Ath	64.77787780761719
695/28840	Where was I then Let me	179.5204315185547
696/28840	Oh at the siege of Besancon I was in the	88.87837982177734
697/28840	Let me see with regard to Porthos I received a letter from him	45.843265533447266
698/28840	He invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of September 16	53.01519775390625
699/28840	Unluckily as I was then in Bearn on account of my fathers death the letter followed me	206.33599853515625
700/28840	I had left Bearn when it arrived and I never received it until the month of April 1647 and as the invitation was for September 1646 I couldnt accept	144.2335205078125
701/28840	Let me look for this letter it must be with my title	99.25312042236328
702/28840	DArtagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his	48.00584030151367
703/28840	He uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of Porthos was discernible and underneath some lines traced by his worthy	59.70877456665039
704/28840	DArtagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the Chateau du Vall	28.382648468017578
705/28840	Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vall	41.350502014160156
706/28840	Devil take the vain fellow said DArtagn	140.29983520507812
707/28840	However I had better find him out first since he cant want	275.1750183105469
708/28840	Athos must have become an idiot by this time from	289.63818359375
709/28840	Aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflex	316.9057922363281
710/28840	He cast his eyes again on the	49.90599822998047
711/28840	There was a postscript   I write by the same courier to our worthy friend Aramis in his	49.40254592895508
712/28840	In his convent What convent There are about two hundred in Paris and three thousand in France and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his	167.21156311035156
713/28840	Well suppose I go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries It would be a curious idea and maybe I should find my friend under the name of	115.182861328125
714/28840	But no I should lose myself in the cardinals	62.898502349853516
715/28840	Great people only thank you for doing the impossible whats possible they say they can effect themselves and they are	236.54542541503906
716/28840	But let us wait a little and	73.2643051147461
717/28840	I received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact I rendered	99.43962860107422
718/28840	Yes yes but now what did I do with that letter   DArtagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old	36.8060188293457
719/28840	He looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its	91.89012908935547
720/28840	As I am of the church and the affair might injure me if I should share it with any other than a sure friend like you I write to beg that you will serve me as	82.136962890625
721/28840	You will enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine under the second lamp on the right you will find your	100.95728302001953
722/28840	I shall be with mine under the	126.39733123779297
723/28840	He had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty swordstroke on the arm then had gone toward Aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his	78.74439239501953
724/28840	I think I have killed the insolent	41.22126770019531
725/28840	But dear friend if you ever need me you know that I am entirely devoted to	29.381433486938477
726/28840	Thereupon Aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arc	88.06364440917969
727/28840	So then he no more knew where Aramis was than where Athos and Porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room	119.92982482910156
728/28840	He thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was	118.11186218261719
729/28840	He was not mistaken as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the	45.45654296875
730/28840	Ah you scoundrel cried DArtagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his	29.22809600830078
731/28840	Sir cried the man in the name of Heaven put your sword back into the sheath and dont kill me	96.84705352783203
732/28840	Im no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my	94.17377471923828
733/28840	My name isah but surely you are Monsieur dArtagnan   And thouPlanchet cried the	28.151201248168945
734/28840	At your service sir said Planchet overwhelmed with joy if I were still capable of serving	55.921592712402344
735/28840	Sir said the prudent Planchet in the first place are you on good terms with Monsieur de Rochefort   Perfectly one of my dearest	29.262617111206055
736/28840	Ah so much the better   But what has De Rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room   Ah sir I must first tell you that Monsieur de Rochefort is   Planchet	30.889089584350586
737/28840	Egad I know where he is said DArtagn	24.43328857421875
738/28840	That is to say he was there replied Planc	37.376216888427734
739/28840	But in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the Rue de la Ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse	68.7209701538086
740/28840	The prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for	238.60983276367188
741/28840	I said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner a friend of the Duc de Beaufort who called for	31.213226318359375
742/28840	The people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst I opened the doors of the carriage and Monsieur de Rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the	74.28630828857422
743/28840	At this moment a patrol passed	155.19894409179688
744/28840	I was obliged to sound a retreat toward the Rue Tiquetonne I was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where I have been concealed between two matt	66.4603271484375
745/28840	This morning I ventured to run along the gutters and   Well interrupted DArtagnan I am delighted that De Rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the kings servants they will hang thee without	71.94447326660156
746/28840	Nevertheless I promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though I risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that I gave one rebel an	144.43820190429688
747/28840	Ah sir you know well I would risk my life for	73.97979736328125
748/28840	Thou mayst add that thou hast risked it Planc	448.6878967285156
749/28840	I have not forgotten all I owe	59.495079040527344
750/28840	Sit down there and eat in	211.6881103515625
751/28840	I see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my	290.87982177734375
752/28840	Yes sir for all Ive had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on	107.96514892578125
753/28840	Although I dont despise sweet things in proper time and place I found the supper rather	299.10198974609375
754/28840	Ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried Planc	35.228267669677734
755/28840	And he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the Rue des Fossoyeurs whilst DArtagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of Planchet under present	56.70883560180664
756/28840	While he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best to make up for lost time at	117.06794738769531
757/28840	At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his	77.03998565673828
758/28840	Come said DArtagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where Athos is   No sir replied Planc	32.56513595581055

765/28840	DArtagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go	20.631906509399414
766/28840	Sir said Planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate Think if I am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a	46.64093017578125

772/28840	DArtagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire Madeleine to come	35.279441833496094
773/28840	When the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing Planc	69.82697296142578

781/28840	You are a precious creature my pretty hostess and I am much obliged to	65.84170532226562

784/28840	It was like having a spy in the enemys	51.14099884033203
785/28840	In this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with Planchet pleased with himself DArtagnan reached Notre	76.72119903564453
786/28840	He ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew Monsieur Baz	76.46695709228516
787/28840	Monsieur Bazin the beadle said the ver	46.49679183959961

789/28840	DArtagnan nearly jumped for joy he had despaired of finding Bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other	73.55835723876953
790/28840	He knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him he made use of his time in gazing at Baz	73.99567413330078
791/28840	Bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propri	192.0254669189453

793/28840	It was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people generally alone	175.3988037109375
794/28840	Bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a	84.09588623046875
795/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan he cried Vade retro Satanas   So my dear Bazin said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old	38.75467300415039
796/28840	Sir replied Bazin the true friends of a Christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing	155.1615753173828
797/28840	I dont understand you Bazin nor can I see how I can be a stumblingblock in the way of your salvation said DArtagn	36.944156646728516
798/28840	You forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the	91.1805191040039
799/28840	My dear Bazin you ought to perceive said DArtagnan from the place in which you find me that I am greatly changed in	38.97442626953125
800/28840	Age produces good sense and as I doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation I want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to	61.81024932861328
801/28840	Rather say to take him back with you into the	94.61175537109375
802/28840	Fortunately I dont know where he	23.088054656982422
803/28840	How cried DArtagnan you dont know where Aramis is   Formerly replied Bazin Aramis was his name of perd	35.43843460083008
804/28840	By Aramis is meant Simara which is the name of a	79.92225646972656
805/28840	Happily for him he has ceased to bear that	144.35055541992188
806/28840	And therefore said DArtagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not Aramis I seek but the Abbé dHerbl	21.061925888061523
807/28840	Come my dear Bazin tell me where he	24.732006072998047
808/28840	Didnt you hear me tell you Monsieur dArtagnan that I dont know where he is   Yes certainly but to that I answer that it is	25.7338924407959
809/28840	It is nevertheless the truth monsieurthe pure truth the truth of the good	103.23255920410156
810/28840	DArtagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of Aramis but whose lies were bold and	75.18956756591797
811/28840	Well Bazin said DArtagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good	35.856117248535156

814/28840	Incorruptible murmured DArtagnan I am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind	105.53018951416016
815/28840	DArtagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the	35.05170440673828
816/28840	He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of	45.67866134643555

829/28840	On honor   What then is there surprising in that  	55.5283317565918
830/28840	And in whose behalf are you looking for them   You are in no doubt on that	36.614376068115234
831/28840	Unfortunately I have no idea where they	41.63484191894531
832/28840	And you have no way to get news of them Wait a week and I myself will give you	70.63093566894531

839/28840	Theres no second Constance in the	142.6693572998047
840/28840	On his return to the cathedral DArtagnan saw Bazin who was conversing with the sacrist	28.155561447143555
841/28840	Bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous	1020.2174682617188
842/28840	DArtagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to	35.593265533447266
843/28840	DArtagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue des Canettes it was impossible that Bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing	35.535369873046875
844/28840	In five minutes Bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no	68.15546417236328
845/28840	Calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the Rue Notre	134.1177215576172
846/28840	Afraid of making any inquiries at this house DArtagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocr	63.832496643066406
847/28840	This beverage required a good halfhour to	520.3329467773438
848/28840	And DArtagnan had time therefore to watch Bazin unsus	51.92959976196289
849/28840	He perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chor	69.3030014038086
850/28840	He questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving DArtagnan learned that he exercised from six oclock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine oclock till midnight that of a waiter in the	56.962039947509766
851/28840	Whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of Bazins	141.51051330566406
852/28840	Look said the boy theres our beadle who is going a	159.67494201660156
853/28840	And where is he going asked DArtagn	27.744401931762695
854/28840	Half a pistole if you can find out said DArtagn	17.086284637451172
855/28840	For me cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if I can find out where Bazin is going That is not	77.14313507080078
856/28840	You are not joking are you   No on the honor of an officer there is the halfpistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it	44.17800521850586
857/28840	Just the very way not to	135.65252685546875
858/28840	Wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find	152.52725219726562
859/28840	The halfpistole is ready and he put it back again into his	47.89661407470703
860/28840	I understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de	109.79412078857422
861/28840	Five minutes afterward Bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding	92.39655303955078
862/28840	Scarcely had he turned the corner of the Rue de la Juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full	51.821144104003906
863/28840	Before ten minutes had elapsed the child	122.84315490722656
864/28840	Well answered the boy the thing is	126.87763214111328
865/28840	Where is he gone   The halfpistole is for me   Doubtless answer	37.699005126953125
866/28840	Give it me that I may see it is not	81.80156707763672
867/28840	The child put the piece of money into his	152.4973602294922
868/28840	And now where is he gone inquired DArtagn	42.02143096923828
869/28840	How dost thou know   Ah faith there was no great cunning	148.4454345703125
870/28840	I knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to	132.12551879882812
871/28840	Now I thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was	85.94829559326172
872/28840	And he answered that Monsieur Bazin went to No	32.184566497802734

876/28840	DArtagnan wrote the childs name in his	35.73295593261719
877/28840	Please sir said the boy do you think I can gain any more halfpistoles in any way   Perhaps replied DArtagn	41.45064926147461
878/28840	And having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the Rue Tiqueton	57.40526580810547
879/28840	DArtagnan Going to a Distance to discover Aram	35.795799255371094
880/28840	On entering the hotel DArtagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the	38.52790832519531
881/28840	It was Planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that DArtagnan himself could hardly recognize	66.2912826538086
882/28840	Madeleine introduced him in presence of all the	155.02349853515625
883/28840	Planchet addressed the officer with a fine Flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded Madeleines brother entered DArtagnans	148.16786193847656
884/28840	The plan adopted by DArtagnan was soon	91.36339569091797
885/28840	He resolved not to reach Noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for Noisy is only three or four leagues from Paris on the road to Me	78.90666198730469
886/28840	A most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the Hotel de la Chevrette for the discovery of Planc	39.22845458984375
887/28840	At about a league and a half from the city DArtagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing	59.61708068847656
888/28840	The inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly	145.11917114257812
889/28840	A man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to	52.437721252441406
890/28840	At four oclock DArtagnan recommenced his	28.994335174560547
891/28840	He proceeded slowly and in deep rever	116.31593322753906
892/28840	Planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the	66.9798583984375
893/28840	One word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to DArtagnans deliberations this was the name of Madame de Longue	51.380245208740234
894/28840	That name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce	581.0454711914062
895/28840	Madame de Longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm she was also one of the greatest beauties at	57.80030059814453
896/28840	She had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with Coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the Place Royale by the Duc de Gu	67.15491485595703
897/28840	He remembered how at the Louvre he had often seen as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms the beautiful Madame de Longue	47.300262451171875
898/28840	He was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when Planchet approached and said   I will lay a wager your honor that you and I are thinking of the same	62.932228088378906
899/28840	I doubt it Planchet replied DArtagnan but what are you thinking of   I am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we	44.96132278442383
900/28840	Ah ah said DArtagnan Planchets recital agreeing with his own	41.18753433227539
901/28840	Well   One of these two men said He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening for I have seen his	58.773990631103516
902/28840	Art thou sure said the man in the	337.3481750488281
903/28840	If he is herethis is what the other man saidlets see decidedly what to do with	129.41783142089844
904/28840	What to do with him answered the	35.85890579223633
905/28840	Yes hes not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow hell defend	117.56379699707031
906/28840	Well we must try to take him	67.29493713378906
907/28840	Have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth   We	76.19071197509766
908/28840	Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horse	117.31890106201172
909/28840	Yes yes my lord dont be	169.9990997314453
910/28840	You will assure us that justice   Yes yes I answer for all that the prince	61.073360443115234
911/28840	Having said that they went out of the	48.12769317626953
912/28840	Well what matters all that to us said DArtagn	35.257503509521484
913/28840	This is one of those attempts that happen every	86.37005615234375
914/28840	Are you sure that we are not its objects   We Why   Just remember what they	94.69660949707031
915/28840	I have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to	64.9637222290039
916/28840	Well   He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to	51.80781555175781
917/28840	What else   Then the prince said Take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musket	42.86410140991211
918/28840	Now then what do you say to that   Alas my dear Planchet said DArtagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate	34.13019943237305
919/28840	Those were good old days never fearthese people owe us no gr	463.4482727050781
920/28840	Is your honor sure   I can answer for it they do	47.96684646606445
921/28840	Well we wont speak of it any more then and Planchet took his place in DArtagnans suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not	83.17879486083984
922/28840	They had traveled onward about half a mile when Planchet came close up to DArtagn	53.553131103515625
923/28840	Stop sir look yonder he whispered dont you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows I fancy I hear horses	394.3757019042969
924/28840	The ground is soaking wet yet I fancy as thou sayest that I see	314.17193603515625
925/28840	At this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness and	284.22955322265625
926/28840	There are men somewhere about but thats of no consequence to us said DArtagnan let us ride	88.61808013916016
927/28840	At about halfpast eight oclock they reached the first houses in Noisy every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the	40.32904815673828
928/28840	The obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of	187.04005432128906
929/28840	Here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like perid	246.57803344726562
930/28840	These were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the	189.95399475097656
931/28840	Toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous limet	130.01712036132812
932/28840	This he said to Planchet must be the archbishops chateau the abode of the fair Madame de Longueville but the convent where is that   The convent your honor is at the other end of the village I know it	30.928218841552734
933/28840	Well then Planchet gallop up to it whilst I tighten my horses girth and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the Jesuits	89.53950500488281
934/28840	Sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted	97.08128356933594

937/28840	Yes added Planchet like the famous ass of Bur	99.11100769042969
938/28840	Shall I knock   Hush replied DArtagnan the light no longer burns in yonder	55.05773162841797
939/28840	What is that noise   There came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each composed of ten men sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded DArtagnan and Planc	70.68804168701172
940/28840	Heyday cried DArtagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken is it really for us that you mean your attack   Here he is we have him cried the horsemen rushing on DArtagnan with naked	52.57002258300781

942/28840	No my lord be assured we shall	56.51652145385742
943/28840	DArtagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the	30.328210830688477
944/28840	Halloo gentlemen he called out in his Gascon accent what do you want what do you demand   That thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horse	77.68828582763672
945/28840	Stop stop cried he whom they had addressed as my lord tis not his	144.52783203125

947/28840	The chieftain of the party drew	169.4213104248047
948/28840	What are you doing here he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to	57.356266021728516
949/28840	And youwhat are you doing here replied DArtagn	26.291643142700195
950/28840	Be civil or I shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to ones	226.366943359375
951/28840	You dont choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned DArtagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant I have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my	63.54686737060547
952/28840	Do you know Monsieur dArtagnan   Lieutenant in the kings musketeers said the voice you are Monsieur dArtagnan   I	9.615707397460938
953/28840	Then you came here to defend him   Him whom   The man we are	59.03110122680664
954/28840	It seems said DArtagnan that whilst I thought I was coming to Noisy I have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of	60.22024917602539
955/28840	Come replied the same lofty tone answer Are you waiting for him underneath these windows Did you come to Noisy to defend him   I am waiting for no one replied DArtagnan who was beginning to be	54.43843078613281
956/28840	I propose to defend no one but myself and I shall defend myself vigorously I give you	79.92332458496094
957/28840	Very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to	81.87931060791016
958/28840	Our blow has failed for tonight let us	374.08172607421875
959/28840	We shall meet again Master dArtagnan continued the leader raising his	53.991851806640625
960/28840	Yes but never with the same advantages said DArtagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be	37.41868591308594
961/28840	Very good very good said the	108.20449829101562
962/28840	And the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to	50.57615661621094
963/28840	DArtagnan and Planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their	55.836219787597656
964/28840	Thou seest simpleton said DArtagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to	62.91143035888672
965/28840	But to whom then   Ifaith I neither know nor	87.5012435913086
966/28840	What I do care for now is to make my way into the Jesuits convent so to horse and let us knock at their	135.53802490234375
967/28840	Happen what will the devil take them they cant eat	396.7591247558594
968/28840	Planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank	84.58234405517578
969/28840	Hey your honor cried Planchet Ive a man behind	57.962974548339844
970/28840	DArtagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchets	93.82500457763672
971/28840	Tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new	142.8125
972/28840	No no dear DArtagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis Aramis gallop fast Planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the	45.75862121582031
973/28840	And Planchet with Aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by DArtagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic	30.857879638671875
974/28840	At the extremity of the village Planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of Aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in	43.2818717956543
975/28840	Aramis alighted and clapped his hands three	70.88604736328125
976/28840	Immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from	254.56301879882812
977/28840	My friend said Aramis if you like to ascend I shall be delighted to receive	30.047760009765625
978/28840	Ah said DArtagnan is that the way you return to your apartment   After nine at night pardieu said Aramis the rule of the convent is very	64.4675521850586
979/28840	Pardon me my dear friend said DArtagnan I think you said pardieu   Do you think so said Aramis smiling it is	15.517740249633789
980/28840	You have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom I am obliged to	154.009521484375
981/28840	But will you not go up   Pass on before me I beg of	66.72881317138672
982/28840	As the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way s	91.27465057373047
983/28840	And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an	75.9519271850586
984/28840	DArtagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was	114.99118041992188
985/28840	I beg your pardon said Aramis noticing his awkwardness if I had known that I was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured the gardeners ladder but for me alone this is good	47.150428771972656
986/28840	Sir said Planchet when he saw DArtagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you in case of necessity I might also climb up but my two horses cannot mount the	51.16416931152344
987/28840	Take them to yonder shed my friend said Aramis pointing to a low building on the plain there you will find hay and straw for them then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and	123.70164489746094
988/28840	Marry forsooth people dont die of hunger	657.4611206054688
989/28840	And Aramis drawing in the ladder closed the	94.73360443115234
990/28840	Never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more	105.95893859863281
991/28840	At each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de Lorraine the Cardinal de Richelieu the Cardinal de la Valette and the Archbishop of Borde	110.68380737304688
992/28840	Exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abb	58.92123031616211
993/28840	You are examining my den said Aram	85.3951644897461
994/28840	Ah my dear fellow excuse me I am lodged like a Chartre	91.26573181152344
995/28840	But what are you looking for   I am looking for the person who let down the	42.44255447387695
996/28840	I see no one and yet the ladder didnt come down of	209.54225158691406
997/28840	But continued Aramis Bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that I was not alone he discreetly	98.11957550048828
998/28840	Sit down my dear friend and let us	36.32545852661133
999/28840	And Aramis pushed forward a large easychair in which DArtagnan stretched himself	65.1068115234375
1000/28840	In the first place you will sup with me will you not asked Aram	32.4471549987793
1001/28840	Yes if you really wish it said DArtagnan and even with great pleasure I confess the journey has given me a devil of an	57.46595764160156
1002/28840	Ah my poor friend said Aramis you will find meagre fare you were not	43.522037506103516
1003/28840	Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur   Oh let us hope said Aramis that with the help of God and of Bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy Jesuit	72.583251953125
1004/28840	The door opened and Bazin entered on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of	31.981122970581055
1005/28840	So far well said Aramis we are dying of	69.32352447509766
1006/28840	Serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good	459.095458984375
1007/28840	Bazin bowed low sighed and left the	192.85186767578125
1008/28840	Now we are alone dear Aramis said DArtagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of Planchets	41.04139709472656
1009/28840	Ifaith answered Aramis as you see from	124.7943115234375
1010/28840	From Heaven replied DArtagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going	47.26033401489258
1011/28840	My friend said Aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which DArtagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if I did not come from Heaven at least I was leaving Paradise which is almost the	33.12236022949219
1012/28840	Paradise is at Noisy le Sec upon the site of the archbishops chate	78.71064758300781
1013/28840	Aramis burst into a fit of	74.48931121826172
1014/28840	You were always a merry companion my dear DArtagnan he said and your witty Gascon fancy has not deserted	69.77021789550781
1015/28840	Yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is Madame de Longueville with whom I am in	27.552352905273438
1016/28840	A plague ont I shall not do	61.26884841918945
1017/28840	Eventually she was obliged to leave	55.10737609863281
1018/28840	He was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued Aramis glancing at the portrait of the old	76.78717803955078
1019/28840	For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear Marie I know only one other woman who can do it as	134.78909301757812
1020/28840	So they made this song about her _Laboissiere dis moi	941.0123291015625
1021/28840	You know it dont you   No sing it	171.1566162109375
1022/28840	Aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively	215.7855682373047
1023/28840	Bravo cried DArtagnan you sing charmingly dear Aram	101.31544494628906
1024/28840	I do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your	139.91961669921875
1025/28840	My dear DArtagnan replied Aramis you understand when I was a musketeer I mounted guard as seldom as I could now when I am an abbé I say as few masses as I	43.71262741088867
1026/28840	Whichthe Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville   Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the Duchess de Longueville Little flirtations perhaps and thats	27.59530258178711
1027/28840	No I spoke of the Duchess de Chevreuse did you see her after her return from Brussels after the kings death   Yes she is still	58.01744842529297
1028/28840	Yes said Aramis I saw her also at that	39.266510009765625
1029/28840	I gave her good advice by which she did not	94.60115814208984
1030/28840	I ventured to tell her that Mazarin was the lover of Anne of	35.08222579956055
1031/28840	She wouldnt believe me saying that she knew Anne of Austria who was too proud to love such a worthless cox	79.9345703125
1032/28840	After that she plunged into the cabal headed by the Duke of Beaufort and the coxcomb arrested De Beaufort and banished Madame de Chevre	55.199790954589844
1033/28840	You know resumed DArtagnan that she has had leave to return to France   Yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or	62.445308685302734
1034/28840	Oh but this time perhaps she will follow your	60.02635955810547
1035/28840	Oh this time returned Aramis I havent seen her she is much	88.05583190917969
1036/28840	In that respect unlike you my dear Aramis for you are still the same you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a pre	115.18550109863281
1037/28840	Yes replied Aramis I am extremely careful of my	60.64453887939453
1038/28840	Do you know that I am growing old I am nearly thirty	95.1613540649414
1039/28840	Indeed Then tis I who am mistaken for you have always been a good chron	86.63817596435547
1040/28840	By your reckoning I must be fortythree at	99.49758911132812
1041/28840	The devil I am Dont let it out at the Hotel Rambouillet it would ruin me replied the abb	57.26160430908203
1042/28840	Why what in the world cried Aramis is that animal Bazin doing Bazin Hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst   Bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each	105.2938003540039
1043/28840	But I give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on	125.69136047363281
1044/28840	Bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his	96.59091186523438
1045/28840	DArtagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the Abbé dHerblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the Musketeer Aramis remained staring with wideopen eyes at the face of his	45.22365188598633
1046/28840	Bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that DArtagnan was quite	70.29631805419922
1047/28840	But you expected some one then asked the	108.54287719726562
1048/28840	Oh said Aramis I always try to be prepared and then I knew you were seeking	48.22563552856445
1049/28840	From whom   From Master Bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musket	52.705360412597656
1050/28840	Oh monsieur said Bazin clasping his hands supplicating	13.884417533874512
1051/28840	Come no hypocrisy you know that I dont like	94.0270004272461
1052/28840	You will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend Planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his	66.42902374267578
1053/28840	Planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed	76.47217559814453
1054/28840	Bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to Planchet who then went satisfied to his	86.7440414428711
1055/28840	The two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable	79.90225219726562
1056/28840	The deuce cried DArtagnan do you live in this way always   Yes pretty	51.29265213012695
1057/28840	Nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said DArtagn	46.740997314453125
1058/28840	What can you expect replied Aramis in a tone of	37.67622756958008
1059/28840	Every man thats born must fulfil his	1236.48095703125
1060/28840	If it be not an indelicate question resumed DArtagnan have you grown rich   Oh Heaven	95.7174301147461
1061/28840	I make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave	47.77998733520508
1062/28840	And how do you make your twelve thousand francs By your poems   No I have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram I compose sermons my	107.97296905517578
1063/28840	What sermons Do you preach them   No I sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great or	89.175537109375
1064/28840	Ah indeed and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself   I should my dear DArtagnan have been so but nature said	61.53449249267578
1065/28840	When I am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me I look at her again if she smiles I smile	215.020263671875
1066/28840	Then I speak at random instead of preaching about the torments of hell I talk of the joys of	265.3826904296875
1067/28840	An event took place in the Church of	125.43516540527344
1068/28840	I stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away I found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of	152.7021942138672
1069/28840	Tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbélike all other abb	43.84100341796875
1070/28840	And what was the end of the affair   We met in the Place RoyaleEgad you know about	45.692405700683594
1071/28840	Was I not your second cried DArtagn	32.0462532043457

1073/28840	Did he die   I dont	33.41645812988281
1074/28840	But at all events I gave him absolution in articulo mort	57.96728515625
1075/28840	Tis enough to kill the body without killing the	243.6970672607422
1076/28840	Bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was	203.54196166992188
1077/28840	Bazin my friend said Aramis you dont seem to be aware that I can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all I have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprob	36.288185119628906
1078/28840	You will do me the favor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to	84.09957885742188
1079/28840	Besides my friend DArtagnan has something to say to me privately have you not DArtagnan   DArtagnan nodded his head and Bazin retired after placing on the table the Spanish	29.308433532714844
1080/28840	The two friends left alone remained silent face to	173.40834045410156
1081/28840	Aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion DArtagnan to be preparing his exord	99.5431900024414
1082/28840	Each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly	126.20105743408203
1083/28840	It was Aramis who broke the	84.4888687133789
1084/28840	What are you thinking of DArtagnan he	18.52591323852539
1085/28840	I was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musket	48.693973541259766
1086/28840	Tis true man as you know said Aramis is a strange animal made up of	71.80303192138672
1087/28840	Since I became an abbé I dream of nothing but	77.95004272460938

1093/28840	Then you would have killed Monsieur de Marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men   Undoubtedly said Aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if I could have drawn without being	40.120643615722656
1094/28840	Well I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill Monsieur de Marsillac whenever you please prince though he	90.53567504882812

1101/28840	The shadow of a cloud passed over Aramiss face as quickly as that which in August passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape DArtagnans	93.1826171875
1102/28840	Do you take any interest in politics   A gleam of light shone in Aramiss eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by DArtagn	40.251708984375
1103/28840	Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but God   It is	89.54415893554688
1104/28840	Have you my dear Aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play   Certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious	150.31820678710938

1106/28840	Aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the	413.8985900878906
1107/28840	To meddle in politics he exclaimed in a languid voice leaning back in his easy	90.34657287597656
1108/28840	Ah dear DArtagnan see how regularly I live and how easy I am	87.93389129638672
1109/28840	We have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well	101.51827239990234

1114/28840	I have no doubt of it said DArtagn	10.666536331176758

1116/28840	I will not contradict you there said DArtagn	15.79638957977295
1117/28840	I must confess that I was	35.70846176147461
1118/28840	Monsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius as I thought he is a man of no originonce a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio and he got on by	35.48130798339844

1130/28840	He was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but	59.78141784667969
1131/28840	You see my poor friend that I am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness perhaps I am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to Maz	154.28604125976562

1136/28840	Heres a good opportunity for getting something better than a	193.79750061035156
1137/28840	You are right DArtagnan I held a similar project but as I had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to	92.31793975830078
1138/28840	Every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and I confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak	67.34193420410156
1139/28840	Monsieur de Gondy the cardinals enemy   No the kings friend said Aramis the kings friend you	35.820396423339844
1140/28840	Well it is a question of serving the king the gentlemans	87.8923568725586
1141/28840	He is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the kings enemies are preparing for the poor	114.20403289794922
1142/28840	Ah but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear Aram	73.24324798583984
1143/28840	Yet the king will be at the head of the army on Mazarins	31.534868240356445

1149/28840	Oh oh said Aramis there are questions between them at this very	74.09516906738281
1150/28840	And besides if it is not the prince then Monsieur de Gondy   But Monsieur de Gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for	23.81631851196289

1154/28840	Do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party asked DArtagn	74.26969909667969
1155/28840	I foresee in it the aid of powerful	461.11236572265625
1156/28840	That may be done if they can separate the king from his	77.06099700927734
1157/28840	You Aramis know Anne of Austria better than I	55.08869552612305
1158/28840	Perhaps you are right said Aramis thoughtfully therefore I shall not pledge	47.09877395629883

1160/28840	What have I to do with politics I am not obliged to read any brev	60.96213150024414
1161/28840	I have a jolly little circle of witty abbés and pretty women everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend I shall not meddle in	137.74847412109375
1162/28840	Well listen my dear Aramis said DArtagnan your philosophy convinces me on my	37.35831069946289
1163/28840	I dont know what devil of an insect stung me and made me	163.52670288085938
1164/28840	I have a post by which I live at the death of Monsieur de Tréville who is old I may be a captain which is a very snug berth for a once penniless Gas	42.85548782348633
1165/28840	Instead of running after adventures I shall accept an invitation from Porthos I shall go and shoot on his	95.58169555664062
1166/28840	You know he has estatesPorthos   I should think so	76.36927032470703
1167/28840	Ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the Bishop of Noyon   Good said DArtagnan to	87.6312255859375
1168/28840	Then aloud   And he has taken his ancient name of Vallon   To which he adds that of Bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my tro	47.71472930908203
1169/28840	So that Porthos will be a bar	25.249696731567383
1170/28840	The Baroness Porthos will sound particularly	270.5244140625
1171/28840	And the two friends began to	46.1645622253418
1172/28840	So DArtagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of Mazarins   Nor you of the Prince de Condé   No let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither Cardinalists nor Frond	46.80170440673828
1173/28840	And DArtagnan poured out a glass of	16.263877868652344
1174/28840	At all events if you want me remember the Rue Tiquetonne Hotel de la Chev	17.909440994262695

1177/28840	Oh I cant let you go so I will go with	69.50252532958984
1178/28840	And he took his sword and	68.9471435546875
1179/28840	He wants to be sure that I go away said DArtagnan to	21.59238052368164
1180/28840	Aramis whistled for Bazin but Bazin was asleep in the antechamber and Aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake	58.53829574584961
1181/28840	Bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep	82.58297729492188
1182/28840	Come come sleepy head quick the ladder   But said Bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the	150.12371826171875
1183/28840	Didnt you see that Monsieur dArtagnan mounted with difficulty It will be even more difficult to	48.64436721801758
1184/28840	DArtagnan was about to assure Aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced	42.61420822143555
1185/28840	Bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the	132.249755859375
1186/28840	Presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the	222.67071533203125
1187/28840	Now then said DArtagnan this is something like this is a means of	33.73591613769531
1188/28840	A woman could go up a ladder like	183.3875732421875
1189/28840	Aramiss searching look seemed to seek his friends thought even at the bottom of his heart but DArtagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable	67.44457244873047
1190/28840	Besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his	37.47310256958008
1191/28840	In a moment he was on the	35.61875534057617
1192/28840	Stay there said Aramis I shall return	40.05955505371094
1193/28840	The two friends went toward the	218.94866943359375
1194/28840	At their approach Planchet came out leading the two	131.6234588623047
1195/28840	That is good to see said Aram	48.052181243896484
1196/28840	There is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow Bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the	125.85635375976562
1197/28840	Follow us Planchet we shall continue our conversation to the end of the	38.20362091064453
1198/28840	They traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as they reached the last houses   Go then dear friend said Aramis follow your own	79.89116668701172
1199/28840	Fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your	602.86328125
1200/28840	As for me I remain in my humility and indol	93.00083923339844
1201/28840	What I hate today I adore tomorrow and vice	386.0686340332031
1202/28840	You see that I cannot like you for instance settle on any fixed	315.852783203125
1203/28840	Thou liest subtile one said DArtagnan to	95.15087890625
1204/28840	Thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealth	243.36865234375
1205/28840	They descended into the plain by the	138.48695373535156
1206/28840	Planchet met them hard by the	275.89935302734375
1207/28840	DArtagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook	123.06488800048828
1208/28840	DArtagnan and Planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to	13.762358665466309
1209/28840	But after he had gone about two hundred steps DArtagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and took the pistols from his saddlebow to fasten them to his gird	28.696578979492188
1210/28840	This is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say I was his du	216.0631561279297
1211/28840	Stand here dont stir turn your back to the road and wait for	174.06072998046875
1212/28840	Having thus spoken DArtagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the	114.52381896972656
1213/28840	He had observed between the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the convent of the Jesuits an open space surrounded by a	50.01506042480469
1214/28840	The moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his	117.90349578857422
1215/28840	In truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low	275.6229553222656
1216/28840	Close to the hedge the steps	144.21673583984375
1217/28840	DArtagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the	23.33672332763672
1218/28840	Two men to the astonishment of DArtagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a caval	66.3024673461914
1219/28840	Calm yourself dear Rene said the soft voice the same thing will never happen	402.8371276855469
1220/28840	I have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an	73.69400787353516
1221/28840	Oh answered another voice which DArtagnan instantly recognized as that of Aram	45.88429260253906
1222/28840	Be prudent sensible   I always obey madame when I am commanded by so gentle a	106.56148529052734
1223/28840	Ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft	49.2509651184082
1224/28840	Do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat   Aramis rushed after the fugitive	99.69990539550781
1225/28840	DArtagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed caval	73.36376953125
1226/28840	At that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like DArtagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light DArtagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the Duchess de Longue	47.47667694091797
1227/28840	Aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the	85.70082092285156
1228/28840	Good said DArtagnan rising and brushing his knees now I have theethou art a Frondeur and the lover of Madame de Longue	48.00160217285156
1229/28840	Monsieur Porthos du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierref	7.9454426765441895
1230/28840	It was then in the neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that	40.27924346923828
1231/28840	At midnight the two travelers were at Dammartin but it was then too late to make inquiriesthe host of the Cygne de la Croix had gone to	122.05036926269531
1232/28840	The next morning DArtagnan summoned the host one of those sly Normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct	112.25694274902344
1233/28840	DArtagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his	101.1478500366211
1234/28840	At nine in the morning he reached Nanteuil and stopped for	164.31849670410156
1235/28840	His host here was a good fellow from Picardy who gave him all the information he	83.77039337158203
1236/28840	The Bracieux estate was a few leagues from VillarsCottere	15.918600082397461
1237/28840	DArtagnan was acquainted with VillarsCotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time VillarsCotterets was a royal	36.137901306152344
1238/28840	He therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the Dauphin d	118.5074462890625
1239/28840	There he ascertained that the Bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that Porthos was not at Bracie	32.223087310791016
1240/28840	He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds and resided on his new	21.72965431213379
1241/28840	The travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed	153.92510986328125
1242/28840	It is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and Planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after	80.4335708618164
1243/28840	There was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry	77.0074462890625
1244/28840	Accordingly DArtagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for	55.985145568847656
1245/28840	It need not be said that Planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by DArtagn	74.21617126464844
1246/28840	It was nearly eight oclock when they set out	38.37992477416992

1252/28840	At the extremity of the wood DArtagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal	29.990276336669922
1253/28840	Oh oh he said I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of	129.76702880859375

1259/28840	DArtagnan no longer doubted that this was Porthoss pleasant dwelling	69.18743896484375
1260/28840	The road led straight up to the chateau which compared to its ancestor on the hill was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the Duc dEnghein would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of Charles	104.3104248046875

1358/28840	You say then he continued that the Count de Rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal   Yes and the queen	42.501468658447266

1361/28840	So I think replied DArtagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to	121.05750274658203

1401/28840	I shall fight heart and soul for Mazarin but   But   But he must make me a bar	49.770198822021484
1402/28840	Zounds said DArtagnan thats settled already I will be responsible for the bar	66.36949920654297
1403/28840	On this promise being given Porthos who had never doubted his friends assurance turned back with him toward the	152.00790405273438
1404/28840	As they returned toward the castle DArtagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has	67.34979248046875
1405/28840	Whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie	398.90997314453125
1406/28840	When Porthos had left him to give some orders he saw Mousqueton	37.14769744873047
1407/28840	The face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute fel	143.93637084960938
1408/28840	Here is what I am looking for thought DArtagnan but alas the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which I am	34.98098373413086
1409/28840	He then made a sign for Mousqueton to come to	23.13190269470215
1410/28840	Sir said the servant I have a favour to ask	37.21963882446289
1411/28840	Perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me   Art thou happy friend asked DArtagn	49.66036605834961
1412/28840	As happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than I	148.29481506347656
1413/28840	Well speak if it depends on	146.332763671875
1414/28840	Oh sir it depends on you	130.8674774169922
1415/28840	Sir the favor I have to ask of you is not to call me Mousqueton but M	53.365386962890625
1416/28840	Since I have had the honor of being my lords steward I have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect	77.37316131591797
1417/28840	You sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of	269.0833740234375
1418/28840	DArtagnan smiled Porthos wanted to lengthen out his names Mousqueton to cut his	55.04379653930664
1419/28840	Well my dear Mouston he said rest	121.44353485107422
1420/28840	I will call thee Mouston and if it makes thee happy I will not tutoyer you any	95.91260528564453
1421/28840	Oh cried Mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor I shall be grateful all my life it is too much to	52.157711029052734
1422/28840	Alas thought DArtagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations I am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed	55.112998962402344
1423/28840	Will monsieur remain long with us asked Mousqueton with a serene and glowing count	47.773681640625
1424/28840	I go tomorrow my friend replied DArtagn	34.11431884765625
1425/28840	Ah monsieur said Mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our	29.88218879699707
1426/28840	I fear that is true said DArtagnan in a low	9.723861694335938
1427/28840	What time is it then   Eh why it is after one o	57.47215270996094
1428/28840	Your home is a paradise Porthos one takes no note of	189.43125915527344
1429/28840	I follow you though I am not	88.39128875732422
1430/28840	Come if one cant always eat one can always drinka maxim of poor Athos the truth of which I have discovered since I began to be	122.1743392944336
1431/28840	DArtagnan who as a Gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of Athoss maxim but he did his best to keep up with his	59.64241027832031
1432/28840	He could already see the intendants beaming smile change to a contortion of	640.9569091796875
1433/28840	But he said Mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active	115.1029281616211
1434/28840	That may be true replied Porthos but I am used to him and besides he wouldnt be willing to let me go without him he loves me so	47.63271713256836
1435/28840	And you asked Porthos havent you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligentwhat then is his name   Planchetyes I have found him again but he is lackey no	90.76940155029297
1436/28840	Ah he is a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards How does it happen then that he is in your service   He has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be	41.666481018066406
1437/28840	And the musketeer narrated to his friend Planchets	54.00619888305664
1438/28840	Well said Porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when Planchet would rescue Rochefort and that you would protect him in it   I should not have believed him but men are changed by	53.05648422241211
1439/28840	There is nothing truer than that said Porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is	119.54534149169922
1440/28840	Taste of this it is a Spanish wine which our friend Athos thought much	130.8163604736328
1441/28840	At that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been	81.91089630126953
1442/28840	Tell me Mouston said Porthos are my arms in good condition   Your arms my lordwhat arms   Zounds my	85.78900909423828
1443/28840	What weapons   My military	445.63031005859375
1444/28840	Yes my lord at any rate I think	36.065895080566406
1445/28840	Make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished	186.20355224609375
1446/28840	Which is my best cavalry horse  	172.0555877685547
1447/28840	And the best hack   Bay	152.9965057373047
1448/28840	What horse dost thou choose for thyself   I like Rustaud my lord a good animal whose paces suit	140.6433868408203
1449/28840	Strong thinkest thou   Half Norman half Mecklenburger will go night and	534.4669799804688
1450/28840	Polish up or make some one else polish my	330.9144287109375
1451/28840	Then take pistols with thee and a hunting	253.88827514648438
1452/28840	Are we then going to travel my lord asked Mousqueton rather	90.55484771728516
1453/28840	An expedition sir asked the steward whose roses began to change into l	253.01583862304688
1454/28840	We are going to return to the service Mouston replied Porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long	65.35556030273438
1455/28840	Into the servicethe kings service Mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at DArtagnan with an air of reproach he staggered and his voice was almost	67.92501068115234
1456/28840	We shall serve in a campaign seek out all sorts of adventuresreturn in short to our former	193.70907592773438
1457/28840	These last words fell on Mousqueton like a thunder	57.30099105834961
1458/28840	It was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the	176.0060577392578
1459/28840	The two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the	87.3135986328125
1460/28840	Oh said DArtagnan we dont now make war as we did	40.31770706176758
1461/28840	Today its a sort of diplomatic arrangement ask Planc	114.81590270996094
1462/28840	Mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of DArtagn	61.36928939819336
1463/28840	But he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being	170.47772216796875
1464/28840	The deuce they do said Mousqueton I think I should like the siege of Rochelle better than this war then   Porthos meantime asked DArtagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his	38.63103485107422
1465/28840	Four days replied his friend are necessary to reach Blois one day to rest there three or four days to return to	118.376708984375
1466/28840	Set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the Hotel de la Chevrette Rue Tiquetonne and there await	34.29819869995117
1467/28840	As to myself I shall go around to see Athos for though I dont think his aid worth much one must with ones friends observe all due politeness said DArtagn	133.10028076171875
1468/28840	The friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of Pierrefonds to which Porthos escorted his	41.20835494995117
1469/28840	At least DArtagnan said to himself as he took the road to VillarsCotterets at least I shall not be alone in my	25.124479293823242
1470/28840	That devil Porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if Athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at Aramis that little coxcomb with his too good	101.96989440917969
1471/28840	At VillarsCotterets he wrote to the cardinal   My LordI have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty	42.44087600708008
1472/28840	I am just setting out for Bl	92.26676177978516
1473/28840	The Comte de la Fere inhabits the Castle of Bragelonne in the environs of that	15.442585945129395
1474/28840	He had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his	46.635650634765625
1475/28840	It was many years since DArtagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated	108.12068176269531
1476/28840	Planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound	198.52651977539062
1477/28840	Without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that DArtagnan and Planchet arrived in the neighborhood of Bl	64.089599609375
1478/28840	Going along DArtagnan shaking his head said   I know that my going to Athos is useless and absurd but still I owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of	63.78895568847656
1479/28840	Oh Monsieur Athos was a noble gentleman said Planchet was he not Scattering money round about him as Heaven sprinkles	99.54570770263672
1480/28840	I was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying Oh Tis a noble gentlemanMonsieur Ath	139.18997192382812
1481/28840	Yes true as Gospel said DArtagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine	102.09693145751953
1482/28840	I remember well said Planchet he was fond of drinkingin truth he drank but not as other men	142.70079040527344
1483/28840	One seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say Come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrow	106.3868408203125
1484/28840	And how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle There was no one like him for	82.02533721923828
1485/28840	And now replied DArtagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits	83.59378051757812
1486/28840	God knows Planchet that I should fly from a sight so sad if I did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the Comte de la Fere whom we loved so	41.99559783935547
1487/28840	Planchet shook his head and said	35.5125617980957
1488/28840	It was evident that he shared his masters apprehens	61.480674743652344
1489/28840	Probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that I have heard described at Chamb	164.2548065185547
1490/28840	A man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the	78.59918212890625
1491/28840	Whats your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the Sorbonne and the Rue de lUnivers	113.41983032226562
1492/28840	We are looking for the house of Monsieur de la Fere said DArtagn	8.629461288452148
1493/28840	The peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered	125.43714141845703
1494/28840	Gentlemen he said the wood that I am carting is his I cut it in his copse and I am taking it to the chate	140.59283447265625
1495/28840	DArtagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to Planc	39.32754135131836
1496/28840	He had a heavy handdear old Athosafter	264.0727844238281
1497/28840	DArtagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a	82.43375396728516
1498/28840	He checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep	56.43917465209961
1499/28840	On beholding this house DArtagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heartso powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of	93.39501953125
1500/28840	He proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the	115.98113250732422
1501/28840	Through the gate was seen kitchengardens carefully attended to a spacious courtyard in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries and a carriage drawn by two horses of the	145.17648315429688
1502/28840	This cannot be the establishment of Ath	47.5963020324707
1503/28840	Good heavens suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his	146.30938720703125
1504/28840	Alight Planchet and inquire for I confess that I have scarcely courage so to	79.09135437011719
1505/28840	Does Monsieur le Comte de la Fere live here asked Planc	12.285155296325684
1506/28840	Yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to Planchet who was not in l	39.63040542602539
1507/28840	A nobleman retired from service is he not  	89.93766784667969
1508/28840	And who had a lackey named Grimaud persisted Planchet who had prudently considered that he couldnt have too much	58.60621643066406
1509/28840	Monsieur Grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine Planchet from head to	70.4896240234375
1510/28840	Then cried Planchet joyously I see well that it is the same Comte de la Fere whom we	25.23110008239746
1511/28840	Be good enough to open to me for I wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet	36.09492111206055
1512/28840	Why didnt you say so said the servitor opening the	124.27903747558594
1513/28840	But where is your master   He is following	44.81132507324219
1514/28840	The servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet who made a sign to DArtagn	33.709224700927734
1515/28840	The latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismount	130.4620361328125
1516/28840	He vaulted hastily from his horse whilst Planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the	49.66352462768555
1517/28840	But I know you my lad said Athos appearing on the	42.93437957763672
1518/28840	Oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and I know	14.677180290222168
1519/28840	I am PlanchetPlanchet whom you know	31.066980361938477
1520/28840	But the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected	120.99327087402344
1521/28840	What Planchet is Monsieur dArtagnan here   Here I am my friend dear Athos cried DArtagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from	17.932924270629883
1522/28840	At these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of Ath	137.27923583984375
1523/28840	He rushed toward DArtagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his	27.33364486694336
1524/28840	DArtagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his	156.0228729248047
1525/28840	Athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawingroom where there were several	55.19308090209961
1526/28840	I present to you he said Monsieur le Chevalier DArtagnan lieutenant of his majestys musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that I have ever	28.12109375
1527/28840	DArtagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at Ath	38.24959182739258
1528/28840	Strange Athos was scarcely aged at all His fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than	219.7827606201172
1529/28840	His face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish	277.962646484375
1530/28840	His hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by Titian and Vandy	268.4073791503906
1531/28840	Meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment   Ah tis Raoul who is come	60.69834518432617
1532/28840	Athos as the name of Raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at DArtagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his	57.05778503417969
1533/28840	But DArtagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet	77.82005310058594
1534/28840	Nevertheless DArtagnan was struck by the appearance of this new person	23.826969146728516
1535/28840	It seemed to explain to him the change in Athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated	93.41706848144531
1536/28840	Here you are home again Raoul said the com	87.251708984375
1537/28840	Yes sir replied the youth with deep respect and I have performed the commission that you gave	82.7013931274414
1538/28840	But whats the matter Raoul said Athos very anx	71.71074676513672
1539/28840	Sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little	30.60524559020996
1540/28840	To Mademoiselle de la Valliere asked Athos	14.669772148132324
1541/28840	What is it cried many persons	279.7222595214844
1542/28840	She was walking with her nurse Marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback I	225.54861450195312
1543/28840	She saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise	67.1130142211914
1544/28840	I fear that she has badly sprained her	166.61915588378906
1545/28840	And her mother Madame de SaintRemy have they yet told her of it   No sir Madame de SaintRemy is at Blois with the Duchess of	42.99467468261719
1546/28840	I am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than	213.98211669921875
1547/28840	I am come sir to ask your	68.93067932128906
1548/28840	Send directly to Blois Raoul or rather take horse and ride immediately	369.3180847167969
1549/28840	But where is Louise asked the com	198.63739013671875
1550/28840	I have brought her here sir and I have deposited her in charge of Charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold well	218.86590576171875
1551/28840	The guests now all took leave of Athos excepting the old Duc de Barbe who as an old friend of the family of La Valliere went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his	81.98760223388672
1552/28840	She will be the sooner with her	131.55355834960938
1553/28840	As for you Raoul I am sure it is your fault some giddiness or	82.80339813232422
1554/28840	No sir I assure you muttered Raoul it is	46.569129943847656
1555/28840	Oh no no I declare it is not cried the young girl while Raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her	52.45370101928711
1556/28840	Nevertheless Raoul you must go to Blois and you must make your excuses and mine to Madame de SaintR	35.63724136352539
1557/28840	Whilst this scene was going on DArtagnan remained with open mouth and a confused	121.80258178710938
1558/28840	Everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with	57.74699020385742
1559/28840	Athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the	67.65048217773438
1560/28840	Whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared	179.01914978027344
1561/28840	True monsieur le comte replied DArtagnan who felt that by degrees Athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over	25.139549255371094
1562/28840	First and foremost dear DArtagnan we have no title such as count	77.3239974975586
1563/28840	When I call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you	83.16482543945312
1564/28840	But to you DArtagnan I am I hope still dear Athos your comrade your	49.826534271240234
1565/28840	Do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were   Oh God forbid   Then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each	62.59822082519531
1566/28840	You are surprised at what you see here   Extreme	42.71154022216797
1567/28840	But above all things I am a marvel to you   I confess	49.023529052734375
1568/28840	I am still young am I not Should you not have known me again in spite of my eightandforty years of age   On the contrary I do not find you the same person at	46.87678527832031
1569/28840	I understand cried Athos with a gentle	101.91686248779297
1570/28840	Everything DArtagnan even folly has its	94.83995056152344
1571/28840	Then your means it appears are improved you have a capital houseyour own I presume You have a park and horses	403.0090637207031
1572/28840	Yes I inherited this little property when I quitted the army as I told	87.82017517089844
1573/28840	The park is twenty acrestwenty comprising kitchengardens and a	255.5101318359375
1574/28840	I have two horsesI do not count my servants bobtailed n	139.6572723388672
1575/28840	My sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two set	614.87451171875
1576/28840	But then all this extravagance is not for myself added Athos	86.53569030761719
1577/28840	Yes I see for the young man Raoul said DArtagn	20.404285430908203
1578/28840	You guess aright my friend this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country	119.50362396240234
1579/28840	It is Raoul who has worked in me the change you see I was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to	148.31411743164062
1580/28840	This child has caused me to recover what I had	99.79527282714844
1581/28840	I had no longer any wish to live for myself I have lived for	40.18706512451172
1582/28840	I have corrected the vices that I had I have assumed the virtues that I had	86.35816192626953
1583/28840	I may be mistaken but I believe that Raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could	97.13245391845703
1584/28840	The remembrance of Milady recurred to DArtagn	24.753549575805664
1585/28840	And you are happy he said to his	48.22766876220703
1586/28840	As happy as it is allowed to one of Gods creatures to be on this earth but say out all you think DArtagnan for you have not yet done	63.651554107666016
1587/28840	You are too bad Athos one can hide nothing from you answered DArtagn	55.575164794921875
1588/28840	I wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling   Remorse I finish your	119.49786376953125
1589/28840	I do not feel remorse because that woman I profoundly hold deserved her	180.99935913085938
1590/28840	Had she one redeeming trait I doubt	292.1618957519531
1591/28840	I do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of	131.57420349121094
1592/28840	But I do not mean my friend that we were right in what we	37.869625091552734
1593/28840	Hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish	399.0442810058594
1594/28840	I have sometimes thought as you do Ath	69.36399841308594
1595/28840	She had a son that unhappy woman  	91.64669799804688
1596/28840	Have you ever heard of him  	60.611549377441406
1597/28840	He must be about twentythree years of age said Athos in a low	14.007570266723633
1598/28840	I often think of that young man DArtagn	28.556659698486328
1599/28840	Strange for I had forgotten him said the	56.82680130004883
1600/28840	And Lord de Winterdo you know anything about him   I know that he is in high favor with Charles	40.454444885253906
1601/28840	The fortunes of that monarch now are at low	1249.444091796875
1602/28840	He shed the blood of Strafford that confirms what I said just nowblood will have	167.63348388671875
1603/28840	And the queen   What queen   Madame Henrietta of England daughter of Henry	45.849918365478516
1604/28840	She is at the Louvre as you	30.62578010559082
1605/28840	Yes and I hear in bitter	224.9053192138672
1606/28840	Her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in	212.27589416503906
1607/28840	Do you grasp that said Athos shrugging his shoulders the daughter of Henry	22.027482986450195
1608/28840	shivering for want of a fagot Why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from Mazarin She should have wanted	250.24082946777344
1609/28840	Have you ever seen the queen of England inquired DArtagn	24.500938415527344
1610/28840	No but my mother as a child saw	120.58094787597656
1611/28840	Did I ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to Marie de Medici  	62.48153305053711
1612/28840	You know Athos you never spoke much of such	237.72637939453125
1613/28840	Ah mon Dieu yes you are right Athos replied but then there must be some occasion for	76.46830749511719
1614/28840	Porthos wouldnt have waited for it so patiently said DArtagnan with a	32.027976989746094
1615/28840	Every one according to his nature my dear DArtagn	28.12595558166504
1616/28840	Porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent	165.49090576171875
1617/28840	I sometimes wonder replied Athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound	97.57219696044922
1618/28840	Friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts DArtagn	421.5020751953125
1619/28840	Believe me it is only the evilminded who deny friendship they cannot understand	266.92071533203125
1620/28840	And Aramis   I have seen him also said DArtagnan but he seemed to me	18.40414810180664
1621/28840	Ah you have seen Aramis said Athos turning on DArtagnan a searching	25.694976806640625
1622/28840	Why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the Temple of Friendship as the poets would	58.848533630371094
1623/28840	Aramis you know continued Athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with	109.93043518066406
1624/28840	I believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said DArtagn	24.107616424560547
1625/28840	Athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of	254.33477783203125
1626/28840	You see said he calling DArtagnans attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hours walk we have made a tour of my	45.85539627075195
1627/28840	All is charming and everything savors of nobility replied DArtagn	92.07750701904297
1628/28840	At this instant they heard the sound of horses	112.23729705810547
1629/28840	Tis Raoul who has come back said Athos and we can now hear how the poor child	46.922828674316406
1630/28840	In fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtyard leaped from his horse which he consigned to the charge of a groom and then went to greet the count and DArtagn	36.406856536865234
1631/28840	Monsieur said Athos placing his hand on DArtagnans shoulder monsieur is the Chevalier DArtagnan of whom you have often heard me speak Ra	21.459156036376953
1632/28840	Monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous	34.854576110839844
1633/28840	That little compliment could not fail to move DArtagn	76.76155853271484
1634/28840	But he will make it up in you I am	50.37784194946289
1635/28840	I like your manner Raoul and your politeness has touched	101.45733642578125
1636/28840	Athos was more delighted than can be	437.8330383300781
1637/28840	He looked at DArtagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on Raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive	38.99857711791992
1638/28840	Now said DArtagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance I am sure of	39.093955993652344
1639/28840	I hope the accident has been of no consequence   They dont yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been	98.24584197998047
1640/28840	At this moment a little boy half peasant half footboy came to announce	237.7606201171875
1641/28840	Athos led his guest into a diningroom of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hothouse full of magnificent	141.65518188476562
1642/28840	The plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the	278.1369934082031
1643/28840	DArtagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of	45.32759475708008
1644/28840	Yes a chef doeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini replied Ath	171.3882293701172
1645/28840	What battle does it represent   That of Marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to Francis	190.04258728027344
1646/28840	It was on that occasion that my ancestor Enguerrand de la Fere was made a knight of the Order of	59.15632247924805
1647/28840	Michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of work	105.30378723144531
1648/28840	Men were giants in those times said Athos now we are pigmies in	103.27800750732422
1649/28840	Call Charles he added addressing the boy who	193.57122802734375
1650/28840	My good Charles I particularly recommend to your care Planchet the laquais of Monsieur DArtagn	79.43450164794922
1651/28840	He likes good wine now you have the key of the	151.32093811035156
1652/28840	He has slept a long time on a hard bed so he wont object to a soft one take every care of him I beg of	135.119873046875
1653/28840	You think of everything said DArtagnan and I thank you for Planchet my dear Ath	21.258928298950195
1654/28840	Raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus	83.26013946533203
1655/28840	My friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when I hear	157.3805389404297
1656/28840	Tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to	184.81761169433594
1657/28840	What do you mean sir inquired Ra	22.93248748779297
1658/28840	He was eighteen only three years older than you are Raoul when I saw him set to work pitted against tried	150.00086975097656
1659/28840	And did Monsieur DArtagnan come off the conqueror asked the young man with glistening	34.0001220703125
1660/28840	I killed one man if I recollect rightly replied DArtagnan with a look of inquiry directed to Athos another I disarmed or wounded I dont remember	76.54393768310547
1661/28840	Wounded said Athos it was a phenomenon of	54.872562408447266
1662/28840	The young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but Athos pointed out to him that his guest must need rep	111.19020080566406
1663/28840	DArtagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but Athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by Ra	47.6122932434082
1664/28840	DArtagnan retired to bednot to sleep but to think over all he had heard that	70.54591369628906
1665/28840	Being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for Athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunk	193.09027099609375
1666/28840	He admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of Athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of Athos appeared to promise favorably for his	176.4971160888672
1667/28840	Nevertheless it seemed to him that Athos was not in all respects sincere and	67.18893432617188
1668/28840	It was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that Athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenants	57.74933624267578
1669/28840	He could not help thinking of	34.64529800415039
1670/28840	The clear and vigorous intellect of Athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would	204.67572021484375
1671/28840	He would enter into the ministers schemes with the more ardor because his natural activity would be doubled by	206.26339721679688
1672/28840	Resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day DArtagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after	60.818519592285156
1673/28840	He determined to cultivate the goodwill of the youth Raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the Athos of old times with the Athos of the	157.92103576660156
1674/28840	But DArtagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of Ath	101.07172393798828
1675/28840	Besides to tell truth whilst DArtagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of Aramis or the vanity of Porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with Athos truehearted open Ath	81.27214050292969
1676/28840	It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that Athos on the contrary would despise	55.15956115722656
1677/28840	Ah why is not Grimaud the taciturn Grimaud here thought DArtagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with Grimaud silence was another form of eloquence   There reigned a perfect stillness in the	67.92293548583984
1678/28840	DArtagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn	69.33245849609375
1679/28840	At last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen	197.38116455078125
1680/28840	Not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber aboveas he supposed the bedroom of Ath	87.21773529052734
1681/28840	He is walking about and thinking thought DArtagnan but of what It is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not	53.910133361816406
1682/28840	At length Athos went to bed apparently for the noise	204.83428955078125
1683/28840	Silence and fatigue together overcame DArtagnan and sleep overtook him	141.6605224609375
1684/28840	He was not however a good	102.76211547851562
1685/28840	Scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the	155.5258026123047
1686/28840	Somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealth	597.6155395507812
1687/28840	True to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know DArtagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of Ra	75.9236831665039
1688/28840	The young man was opening the door of the	72.99280548095703
1689/28840	The road as DArtagnan had observed was the way to Bl	46.126102447509766
1690/28840	So thought the Gascon heres a young blade who has already his love affair who doesnt at all agree with Athos in his hatred to the fair	120.12928771972656
1691/28840	Hes not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms hes not going on a message for he goes	155.88052368164062
1692/28840	Why does he go in secret Is he afraid of me or of his father for I am sure the count is his	111.0047836303711
1693/28840	By Jove I shall know about that soon for I shall soon speak out to Ath	67.73773193359375
1694/28840	Day was now advanced all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened one after the	88.2093505859375

1696/28840	The latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the	317.5140075683594
1697/28840	The Gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went	110.24129486083984
1698/28840	Scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw Athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crownpiece in the	61.37160110473633
1699/28840	Goodday to you have you slept well   Excellently Athos but what are you looking for You are perhaps a tulip fancier   My dear friend if I am you must not laugh at me for being	76.87910461425781
1700/28840	In the country people alter one gets to like without knowing it all those beautiful objects that God causes to spring from the earth which are despised in	222.9829864501953
1701/28840	I was looking anxiously for some iris roots I planted here close to this reservoir and which some one has trampled upon this	108.9054183959961
1702/28840	These gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse out to the water theyve allowed him to walk over the	160.18421936035156
1703/28840	Ah you think so do you   And he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were	103.89286041259766
1704/28840	Here are the horses hoofs again it seems Athos he said care	176.43048095703125

1714/28840	You do not make Raoul work so he takes his own way of employing	178.88894653320312
1715/28840	Exactly therefore I think of sending him away from	107.13267517089844

1722/28840	I think I shall send him to	33.71555709838867

1742/28840	Athos was for a few moments	164.30596923828125
1743/28840	Good DArtagnan is for Mazarin he said to	31.313762664794922
1744/28840	From that moment he grew very	413.9563903808594
1745/28840	On his side DArtagnan became more cautious	118.87640380859375

1754/28840	And what makes me all the more wretched sir is that I was the cause of this	70.46552276611328
1755/28840	It was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of	92.95663452148438

1757/28840	Ah sir answered Raoul you joke about a real misfortune that is cruel	185.17733764648438
1758/28840	The good understanding between the two friends was not in the least altered by the mornings skirm	87.19585418701172
1759/28840	They breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor Raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at	141.0869140625
1760/28840	The other was in a feminine hand long and	255.5008544921875
1761/28840	Come said DArtagnan to Raoul seeing that Athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse	42.00944900512695
1762/28840	And they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing	305.92706298828125
1763/28840	In a quarter of an hour Athos joined them and at the same moment Charles brought in a letter for DArtagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly	59.87541961669922
1764/28840	It was now Athoss turn to take a sly	173.71438598632812
1765/28840	DArtagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head   See dear friend what it is to belong to the	39.898284912109375
1766/28840	Faith you are indeed right not to return to	103.58966827392578
1767/28840	Monsieur de Tréville is ill so my company cant do without me there my leave is at an end   Do you return to Paris asked Athos	61.66755676269531
1768/28840	Egad yes but why dont you come there also   Athos colored a little and answered   Should I go I shall be delighted to see you	76.97257232666016
1769/28840	Halloo Planchet cried the Gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some	65.07965087890625
1770/28840	Then turning to Athos he added   I seem to miss something	66.30860900878906

1774/28840	The friends embraced cordially DArtagnan pressed Raouls	63.38970947265625
1775/28840	Will you not come with me he said I shall pass by Bl	51.94553756713867
1776/28840	Raoul turned toward Athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to	47.64599609375
1777/28840	No monsieur replied the young man I will remain with monsieur le com	8.082304954528809
1778/28840	Adieu then to both my good friends said DArtagnan may God preserve you as we used to say when we said goodbye to each other in the late cardinals	53.57143020629883
1779/28840	Athos waved his hand Raoul bowed and DArtagnan and Planchet set	34.507389068603516
1780/28840	The count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said   Raoul we set out tonight for	49.642433166503906
1781/28840	Eh cried the young man turning	22.195890426635742
1782/28840	You may go and offer your adieux and mine to Madame de SaintR	42.52815628051758
1783/28840	I shall wait for you here till	131.5062713623047
1784/28840	The young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his	63.16476821899414
1785/28840	As to DArtagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again   Return immediately to	44.83256912231445
1786/28840	The epistle is laconic said DArtagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably I should not have understood it but happily there is a post	41.90891647338867
1787/28840	And he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the	132.58200073242188
1788/28840	Go to the kings treasurer at Blois tell him your name and show him this letter you will receive two hundred pist	50.38383102416992
1789/28840	Assuredly said DArtagnan I admire this piece of	58.56317138671875
1790/28840	The cardinal writes better than I	387.2129821777344
1791/28840	Come Planchet let us pay a visit to the kings treasurer and then set	32.5068244934082
1792/28840	Toward Paris sir   Toward	685.9705810546875
1793/28840	And they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could	252.60513305664062
1794/28840	There was a dispute among the	161.9081268310547
1795/28840	I tell you one of them was saying that if Coysel predicted that tis as good as true I know nothing about it but I have heard say that hes not only an astrologer but a	62.48727798461914
1796/28840	Deuce take it friend if hes one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying	268.7733154296875
1797/28840	Why   Because he may be tried for	48.534427642822266
1798/28840	Ah absurd they dont burn sorcerers	503.5701599121094
1799/28840	No Tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt Urban Grandier	93.88179779052734
1800/28840	My friend Urban Grandier wasnt a sorcerer he was a learned	234.60044860839844
1801/28840	He didnt predict the future he knew the pastoften a more dangerous	323.6759033203125
1802/28840	Mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same	178.4899139404297
1803/28840	I dont say resumed the guard that Coysel is not a sorcerer but I say that if his prophecy gets wind its a sure way to prevent its coming	183.8104248046875
1804/28840	How so   Why in this way if Coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not	76.72624206542969
1805/28840	He was an Italian and therefore superst	74.53699493408203
1806/28840	He walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were	96.40303802490234
1807/28840	What were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that Monsieur de Beaufort had escaped were you not   Oh no my lord said the incredulous	35.943363189697266

1810/28840	My lord said the guard I have simply mentioned the prophecy I heard from a man named Coysel who believes that be he ever so closely watched and guarded the Duke of Beaufort will escape before Whitsunt	149.3776092529297
1811/28840	Coysel is a madman returned the	211.64187622070312
1812/28840	Well the queen has not only one son but two then Monsieur de Coligny was killed and   Yes said Mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal   No my lord but he will be answered the	33.548362731933594
1813/28840	After Whitsuntide it would be another	83.08171081542969
1814/28840	There is nothing so convincing as a firm	149.41458129882812
1815/28840	It has its own effect upon the most incredulous and far from being incredulous Mazarin was superst	97.76412963867188
1816/28840	He went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned Bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over Monsieur de Beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should	58.135894775390625
1817/28840	The guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest	151.0294189453125
1818/28840	During the whole five years in which the Duc de Beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his	54.31992721557617
1819/28840	It was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of Henry	47.06899642944336
1820/28840	especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of	77.00098419189453
1821/28840	But like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his	83.40357971191406

1828/28840	Escape my lordescape Your eminence does not then know where Monsieur de Beaufort is   Yes I do sir in the donjon of Vinc	29.660205841064453
1829/28840	Yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my	249.87060546875

1833/28840	No no cried Mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his	193.91876220703125
1834/28840	He then asked with whom he	214.00332641601562
1835/28840	My lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with	96.01771545410156
1836/28840	But does he not approach the walls while playing   Your eminence doesnt know those walls they are sixty feet high and I doubt if Monsieur de Beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping	106.89599609375
1837/28840	Hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more	183.4457244873047
1838/28840	You mean to say then my dear Monsieur la Ramee   That unless Monsieur de Beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird I will continue answerable for	47.031471252441406
1839/28840	Take care you assert a great deal said Maz	74.23988342285156
1840/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort told the guards who took him to Vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison and that he had found out forty ways of	44.741390228271484
1841/28840	My lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long	176.13148498535156
1842/28840	Come come not such a fool as I fancied thought Maz	123.88787841796875
1843/28840	Besides my lord must remember that Monsieur de Chavigny is governor of Vincennes continued La Ramee and that Monsieur de Chavigny is not friendly to Monsieur de Beau	10.692472457885742
1844/28840	Yes but Monsieur de Chavigny is sometimes	13.411652565002441

1865/28840	During the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man	101.14081573486328
1866/28840	de Beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made	284.5722351074219
1867/28840	But these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the	103.36161804199219
1868/28840	After having failed in poetry Monsieur de Beaufort tried	105.03629302978516
1869/28840	He drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original Portrait of the Illustrious Coxcomb Maz	69.63176727294922
1870/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny the governor of Vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath	47.52189254760742
1871/28840	The next day the prisoners room was full of pictures and mott	134.89454650878906
1872/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of	115.0744400024414
1873/28840	de Beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat	85.0393295288086
1874/28840	The duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawingpaper for him he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in Mazarins	58.14295959472656
1875/28840	The governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that	107.1946029663086
1876/28840	To this Monsieur de Beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a Bayard he would become a Raphael or a Michael	73.29051971435547
1877/28840	Nevertheless one day when Monsieur de Beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly	128.84617614746094
1878/28840	His next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keep	183.2787322998047
1879/28840	With this animal which he called Pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its	205.80136108398438
1880/28840	At last when Pistache was sufficiently well trained Monsieur de Beaufort invited the governor and officers of Vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his	48.42014694213867
1881/28840	The party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the	66.86830139160156
1882/28840	Having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over	103.1161117553711
1883/28840	The intelligent creature was received with loud	834.609130859375
1884/28840	Nothing could be better done a sundial could not have shown the hour with greater	123.1937026977539
1885/28840	Then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in	66.15345001220703
1886/28840	Then the duke put to Pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world   Pistache went again around the circle but stopped at no one and at last went to the door and began to scratch and	73.46644592285156
1887/28840	de Beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what I ask for seeks it out of doors you shall however have his	262.73089599609375
1888/28840	Is not the greatest thief in the world Monsieur the kings secretary Le Camus who came to Paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten millions   The dog shook his	60.010475158691406
1889/28840	Then said the prisoner lets think who it can	186.64732360839844
1890/28840	Can it be can it possibly be the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Piscina hey   Pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times success	72.17169189453125
1891/28840	Gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the Illustrious Coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to Pist	50.834110260009766
1892/28840	Let us go on to another of his	115.03242492675781
1893/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny be so good as to lend me your	24.360631942749023
1894/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny handed his cane to Monsieur de Beau	10.256485939025879
1895/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one	42.374698638916016
1896/28840	Now Pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for Madame de Montb	88.73448944091797
1897/28840	But interposed Monsieur de Chavigny it seems to me that Pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for Mademoiselle de P	30.18332290649414
1898/28840	Stop said the duke Pistache jump for the	38.272396087646484
1899/28840	And he raised his cane six inches	228.4156951904297
1900/28840	The dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over	144.71072387695312
1901/28840	And now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the	83.89955139160156
1902/28840	The dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the	234.70506286621094
1903/28840	Now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground Pistache my friend jump for the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Pisc	56.46267318725586
1904/28840	The dog turned his back to the	103.94424438476562
1905/28840	What asked the duke what do you mean and he gave him the cane again first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of Pist	62.74979782104492
1906/28840	But Pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the	60.02372741699219
1907/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time Pistaches patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his	61.7738037109375
1908/28840	Three days afterward Pistache was found deadpoison	335.5586853027344
1909/28840	Then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that Mazarin had poisoned	80.89659881591797
1910/28840	This fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him	116.76221466064453
1911/28840	So it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted and La Ramee was in consequence placed near him as t	90.2479248046875
1912/28840	Every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent Pist	92.08524322509766
1913/28840	De Chavigny who according to report was a son of Richelieus and had been a creature of the late cardinals understood	50.164825439453125
1914/28840	He took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at Vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting	58.63322067260742
1915/28840	A fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future	119.48504638671875
1916/28840	One morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial	49.362552642822266
1917/28840	Now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated Monsieur de Beau	78.20563507080078
1918/28840	He assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his wellknown difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows   Gentlemen will you permit a grandson of Henry	108.7995834350586
1919/28840	to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy   Odds fish as my grandfather used to say I once reigned in Paris do you know that I had the king and Monsieur the whole of one day in my	77.23238372802734
1920/28840	The queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the	117.30022430419922
1921/28840	Gentlemen and citizens set me free I shall go to the Louvre and strangle Maz	129.18643188476562
1922/28840	I will make you all captains with good pensions Odds fish On march forward   But eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of Henry	84.44750213623047
1923/28840	did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so Monsieur de Beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the	101.30105590820312
1924/28840	Sometimes when Monsieur de Chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of Parisians all fully armed appear at Vincennes to deliver him from	44.654109954833984
1925/28840	My lord answered De Chavigny with a low bow I have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand	107.29913330078125
1926/28840	I should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexpl	283.80767822265625
1927/28840	Yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken I should be obliged to let them hang youat which I should be most unhappy	106.83424377441406
1928/28840	And in his turn the duke bowed low to Monsieur de Chavign	15.808622360229492
1929/28840	And once more he bowed low before his high	123.70613098144531
1930/28840	These bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus   Monsieur de Chavigny turning toward the door used to call out Halloo La Ramee   La Ramee came into the	40.06112289428711
1931/28840	La Ramee I recommend Monsieur le Duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an	83.4555435180664
1932/28840	La Ramee became therefore the dukes dinner guest by compulsionan eternal keeper the shadow of his person but La Rameegay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the dukes eyeshis incorrupt	239.02694702148438
1933/28840	Now although La Ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of Henry	53.88609313964844
1934/28840	hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his	74.62507629394531
1935/28840	One may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and	57.89565658569336
1936/28840	La Ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the mo	46.937808990478516
1937/28840	Twas too brief an enjoyment and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of	94.49007415771484
1938/28840	But Grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second	130.7776336669922
1939/28840	Grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of Vinc	99.01568603515625
1940/28840	He addressed about twelve words to him Grimaud answered in	349.8399353027344
1941/28840	Heres a promising fellow and it is I who have found out his merits said Monsieur de Chavign	40.521522521972656
1942/28840	Go he added and make yourself agreeable to Monsieur la Ramee and tell him that you suit me in all	52.48771667480469
1943/28840	Grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a	356.65301513671875
1944/28840	So after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply La Ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged Grim	106.56529998779297
1945/28840	They are these never to leave the prisoner alone to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keep	254.3511505126953
1946/28840	Good answered Grimaud and he went right to the	72.40615844726562
1947/28840	The duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach Mazarin with his wretched appearance and	57.979061126708984
1948/28840	The comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing	261.4212341308594
1949/28840	As Grimaud entered he saw this comb on the teatable he took it up and as he took it he made a low	69.84195709228516
1950/28840	The duke looked at this strange figure with	119.30684661865234
1951/28840	The figure put the comb in its	419.4981689453125
1952/28840	Ho hey whats that cried the d	165.05023193359375
1953/28840	Who is this creature   Grimaud did not answer but bowed a second	68.65559387207031
1954/28840	Grimaud made a sign that he was	51.834415435791016

1956/28840	A keeper reiterated the duke there was nothing wanting in my collection except this gallows	90.7290267944336
1957/28840	Halloo La Ramee some one   La Ramee ran in haste to obey the	40.77919006347656
1958/28840	Who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the d	57.82678985595703

1960/28840	Why does he take my comb   Why do you take my lords comb asked La Rame	39.30270767211914
1961/28840	Grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word Point	180.67996215820312
1962/28840	What does the animal say asked the d	112.82933044433594
1963/28840	That the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed	149.54714965820312
1964/28840	Are you mad La Ramee You yourself gave me this	153.8415985107422
1965/28840	I was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you I acted in opposition to my	157.3725128173828
1966/28840	I perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he	165.2640380859375
1967/28840	A fresh practical joke now occurred to the d	162.93702697753906
1968/28840	The day was employed in preparations for the	195.26486206054688
1969/28840	Every one grows childish in prison but the character of Monsieur de Beaufort was particularly disposed to become	45.546539306640625
1970/28840	In the course of his mornings walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass a discovery that quite delighted	130.78456115722656
1971/28840	When he came home he formed his handkerchief into a	113.05223846435547
1972/28840	Nothing of all this escaped Grimaud but La Ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his	67.50055694580078
1973/28840	The guards looked on it with	375.6479187011719
1974/28840	Who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frown	78.11290740966797
1975/28840	Grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done	70.90599060058594
1976/28840	What thou again Why didst thou take it   Yeswhy asked La Rame	63.5078239440918
1977/28840	Grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said	146.02682495117188
1978/28840	I will shape it out for you with my	127.17879486083984
1979/28840	And he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as	73.8946533203125
1980/28840	Thats it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst I go and fetch the	81.11151885986328
1981/28840	La Ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a	66.42851257324219
1982/28840	Then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with	55.383583068847656
1983/28840	La Ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus Grimaud however did not even	129.3616180419922
1984/28840	He approached La Ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread   Cardinal he	53.7762565612793

1986/28840	La Ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the	39.09082794189453
1987/28840	He was going to throw the crawfish out also when Grimaud snatched it from his	75.74053192138672
1988/28840	Good to eat he said and put it in his	52.782936096191406
1989/28840	This scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave Grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his	99.22449493408203
1990/28840	But the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even	62.706668853759766
1991/28840	Monsieur de Chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate	47.21352005004883
1992/28840	The prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as Grimaud became the more and more odious to	109.08919525146484
1993/28840	One morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when Grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the	71.04386901855469
1994/28840	You are insupportable cried the duke I shall beat	87.83604431152344

1996/28840	Spy cried the duke more and more enraged I will strangle you with my own	41.77336120605469
1997/28840	And he extended his hands toward Grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind	91.27770233154297
1998/28840	At the same time he felt the dukes arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone   Hush smiling as he uttered the	67.99799346923828
1999/28840	A gesture a smile and a word from Grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short ast	150.7154083251953
2000/28840	Grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a	86.03096008300781

2012/28840	Whereupon Grimaud observing the dukes disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to	62.880332946777344
2013/28840	Here is what you are looking for he	44.7510871887207
2014/28840	The duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into Grimauds hands but Grimaud shook his	91.36714172363281
2015/28840	Thank you monseigneur he said drawing back I am	94.08561706542969
2016/28840	The duke went from one surprise to	180.17811584472656
2017/28840	Grimaud drew near and kissed it	395.7419738769531
2018/28840	The grand manner of Athos had left its mark on Grim	134.328857421875
2019/28840	What shall we do and when and how proceed   It is now eleven answered Grim	102.8907241821289
2020/28840	Let my lord at two oclock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with La Ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramp	54.0582275390625
2021/28840	And then   Your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back	57.17181396484375
2022/28840	Grimaud made a sign that he was going	56.127586364746094
2023/28840	Ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me   I wish my lord would make me one	44.106327056884766
2024/28840	True on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost	77.81812286376953
2025/28840	Now resumed Grimaud Ive only one thing more to askthat your highness will continue to detest	75.82382202148438
2026/28840	At this moment La Ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the	48.37273406982422
2027/28840	The duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his	72.31034851074219
2028/28840	La Ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward	64.61351776123047
2029/28840	Then turning to Grimaud   Very good my friend very	38.32508087158203
2030/28840	You have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon I hope have news that will be agreeable to	72.20990753173828
2031/28840	Grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his	194.18516540527344
2032/28840	Well my lord said La Ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow   So tis you La Ramee in faith tis time you came back	54.23899459838867
2033/28840	I threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall that I mightnt break my promise and strangle Grim	94.13480377197266
2034/28840	I doubt however said La Ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your high	58.59635543823242
2035/28840	Pardieu you are righta mute from the East I swear it was time for you to come back La Ramee and I was eager to see you	47.21937561035156
2036/28840	Monseigneur is too good said La Ramee flattered by the	48.03453826904297
2037/28840	Yes continued the duke really I feel bored today beyond the power of	142.6186981201172
2038/28840	Then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed La Rame	42.82118225097656
2039/28840	I am at your service my	14.610557556152344
2040/28840	I protest my dear La Ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that I would stay forever at Vincennes to have the pleasure of your	31.050378799438477
2041/28840	My lord replied La Ramee I think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be	41.82376480102539
2042/28840	What do you mean Have you seen him lately   He sent for me	33.92955780029297
2043/28840	Really to speak to you about me   Of what else do you imagine he would speak to me Really my lord you are his	44.8076057434082
2044/28840	Ah La Ramee if you would but accept my offers I would make your	44.93589782714844
2045/28840	How you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be	235.5521240234375
2046/28840	I shall no sooner be out of prison than I shall be master of	117.71087646484375
2047/28840	Pshaw pshaw I cannot hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king I see my lord I shall be obliged to fetch a second Grimaud   Very well let us say no more about	52.746856689453125
2048/28840	Monseigneur I see well that I must call Grim	92.86611938476562
2049/28840	And what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me   I admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre	160.10830688476562
2050/28840	What did he say to me He told me to watch	55.427757263183594
2051/28840	And why so why watch me asked the duke uneas	168.61135864257812
2052/28840	Because an astrologer had predicted that you would	79.08988189697266
2053/28840	Ah an astrologer predicted that said the duke starting in spite of	47.26969909667969
2054/28840	Oh mon Dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest	326.0259094238281
2055/28840	And what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence   That if the astrologer in question made almanacs I would advise him not to buy	112.02733612060547
2056/28840	Why not   Because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a	93.66349792480469
2057/28840	Let us go and have a game at tennis La Rame	34.62564468383789
2058/28840	My lordI beg your highnesss pardonbut I must beg for half an hours leave of	136.30657958984375
2059/28840	Why   Because Monseigneur Mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to	61.23981857299805
2060/28840	I bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle whereas on my honor Monsieur de Chavigny though Ive been here a week has not ordered so much as a tart	67.37074279785156
2061/28840	But I then replied probably Monsieur de Chavigny is afraid your pastry is not	41.98863983154297
2062/28840	My pastry not good Well Monsieur La Ramee you shall judge of it yourself and at	78.3863296508789
2063/28840	I cannot I replied it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chate	23.431156158447266
2064/28840	Very well said he go and attend to your affairs since you seem to be in a hurry but come back in half an	45.28179168701172
2065/28840	In half an hour Yes have you breakfasted Faith	197.07196044921875
2066/28840	Well here is a pate that will be ready for you with a bottle of old Burg	39.48402404785156
2067/28840	So you see my lord since I am hungry I would with your highnesss leave And La Ramee bent	55.02172088623047
2068/28840	Go then animal said the duke but remember I only allow you half an	78.16566467285156
2069/28840	May I promise your custom to the successor of Father Marteau my lord   Yes if he does not put mushrooms in his pies thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of Vincennes are fatal to my	55.95453643798828
2070/28840	La Ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a	57.84416580200195
2071/28840	But during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from Madame de Montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew	55.08462142944336
2072/28840	But his confidence in Grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his	144.29771423339844
2073/28840	Pâtés made by the Successor of Father Marteau are	232.22898864746094
2074/28840	In half an hour La Ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their hearts	86.2335205078125
2075/28840	The pates were excellent the wine	610.2545166015625
2076/28840	The weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open	172.62351989746094
2077/28840	The man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of	26.637449264526367
2078/28840	The peasant the gardener was Rochefort whom he believed to be in the Bast	55.43135070800781
2079/28840	Well Whos up there said the	364.1689453125
2080/28840	Be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the d	87.99630737304688
2081/28840	The gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by La Ramee and the	67.479736328125
2082/28840	One however fell at the dukes feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his	52.92978286743164
2083/28840	La Ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the	68.30143737792969
2084/28840	The duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books	131.8162841796875
2085/28840	La Ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not	44.940494537353516
2086/28840	Ask day after tomorrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle and who is no other than Noirmont your former maitre dhot	92.84078979492188
2087/28840	Do not open the pie till you are	286.4366455078125
2088/28840	I hope you will be satisfied with its	34.38066101074219
2089/28840	Your highnesss most devoted servant   In the Bastile as elsewhere   Comte de Roche	36.12034606933594
2090/28840	The duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his	174.0194854736328
2091/28840	La Ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive	85.72783660888672
2092/28840	He endeavored to cheer him up in his	87.82675170898438
2093/28840	Ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if I could but do as you do and eat pates and drink Burgundy at the house of Father Marteaus	53.98552322387695
2094/28840	Tis true my lord answered La Ramee that his pates are famous and his wine	73.9111099243164
2095/28840	In any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of Monsieur de Chavign	30.248252868652344
2096/28840	Well my lord said La Ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them Besides I have promised him your	93.6666259765625
2097/28840	If I am to remain here permanently as Monsieur Mazarin has kindly given me to understand I must provide myself with a diversion for my old age I must turn gour	52.147823333740234
2098/28840	My lord said La Ramee if you will take a bit of good advice dont put that off till you are	62.26762008666992
2099/28840	Good said the Duc de Beaufort to himself every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins perhaps two it seems that Master La Ramees is glutton	79.15274047851562
2100/28840	Let us then take advantage of	70.2225112915039
2101/28840	Then aloud   Well my dear La Ramee the day after tomorrow is a	25.475419998168945
2102/28840	Will you give me a lesson the day after tomorrow   In what   In gastronomy   Willingly my	37.04581832885742
2103/28840	Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny well have a supper here under your	58.09529495239258
2104/28840	The proposal was seductive but La Ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to	81.91531372070312
2105/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of	30.51470375061035
2106/28840	Did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem He reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the	171.53982543945312
2107/28840	As to getting him drunk the duke couldnt hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of	83.26712036132812
2108/28840	Then an idea came to him which harmonized	206.38412475585938
2109/28840	The duke had followed with anxiety La Ramees unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his	104.87879180908203
2110/28840	But presently the exempts face suddenly bright	1273.7239990234375
2111/28840	Well he asked that will do will it not   Yes my lord on one	49.81856155395508
2112/28840	What   That Grimaud shall wait on us at	57.780540466308594
2113/28840	Nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim   To the devil with your Grimaud He will spoil the	102.62823486328125
2114/28840	I will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he doesnt speak your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles	155.05706787109375
2115/28840	Do you know my friend I find one thing very evident in all this you distrust	82.79155731201172
2116/28840	My lord the day after tomorrow is Pentec	43.26436233520508
2117/28840	Well what is Pentecost to me Are you afraid that the Holy Spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison   No my lord but I have already told you what that damned magician	44.72417449951172
2118/28840	And what was it   That the day of Pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of Vinc	44.89564514160156
2119/28840	You believe in sorcerers then you fool   II mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my Lord Giulio who cares about them as an Italian he is superst	94.07821655273438
2120/28840	Well then with well acted goodhumor I allow Grimaud but no one else you must manage it	108.28408813476562
2121/28840	Order whatever you like for supperthe only thing I specify is one of those pies and tell the confectioner that I will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his piesnot only now but when I leave my	113.12125396728516
2122/28840	Then you think you will some day leave it said La Rame	43.11546325683594
2123/28840	The devil replied the prince surely at the death of Maz	102.84172058105469
2124/28840	I am fifteen years younger than he	84.25130462646484
2125/28840	At Vincennes tis true one lives faster   My lord replied La Ramee my lord   Or dies sooner for it comes to the same	35.59684753417969
2126/28840	He stopped however at the door for an	68.02679443359375
2127/28840	Whom does your highness wish me to send to you   Any one except Grim	85.14295196533203
2128/28840	The officer of the guard then with his chessboard  	84.38217163085938
2129/28840	Five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of	57.78023910522461
2130/28840	A strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign a word a	175.6798095703125
2131/28840	The duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the fortyeight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his	103.21577453613281
2132/28840	Besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thoughtin what way was the escape to be effected They had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious p	122.58078002929688
2133/28840	And what friends awaited him without He had friends then after five years in prison If that were so he was indeed a highly favored	235.42422485351562
2134/28840	He forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered	187.34335327148438
2135/28840	It is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was	54.63671875
2136/28840	So the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy	134.331298828125
2137/28840	But his successive defeats did service to the duke in one waythey killed time for him till eight oclock in the evening then would come night and with night	158.12411499023438
2138/28840	So at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him	72.73397064208984
2139/28840	The duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like	327.07415771484375
2140/28840	He dreamed that he was endowed with wingshe wished to fly	196.3623504638672
2141/28840	For a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed	236.50888061523438
2142/28840	His wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really	111.46055603027344
2143/28840	He fell asleep again and another vision	296.23614501953125
2144/28840	He was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave Vinc	23.009918212890625
2145/28840	Grimaud was walking before him with a	257.8760070800781
2146/28840	By degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his	207.0353546142578
2147/28840	At last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to	233.43080139160156
2148/28840	The sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against	260.45904541015625
2149/28840	He made fruitless efforts to go on it was	172.2736358642578
2150/28840	Nevertheless he still saw Grimaud with his lantern in front	138.800048828125
2151/28840	He wished to call out to him but could not utter a	52.4124870300293
2152/28840	Then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing	35.13418197631836
2153/28840	He was discovered all hope of flight was	237.82717895507812
2154/28840	Still the walls seemed to be closing on him they appeared to be in concert with his	78.79107666015625
2155/28840	At last he heard the voice of La Rame	27.702726364135742
2156/28840	La Ramee took his hand and laughed	82.6607894897461
2157/28840	He was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which Ornano Puylaurens and his uncle had	197.77798461914062
2158/28840	Their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly	148.65957641601562
2159/28840	The duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep and La Ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was	51.21894836425781
2160/28840	In fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for	91.0472640991211
2161/28840	What is the matter with your highness asked La Rame	15.039929389953613
2162/28840	Tis your fault you simpleton answered the d	69.04717254638672
2163/28840	With your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that I dreamed that I was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing	137.66973876953125
2164/28840	Come he said tis a warning from	151.8538055419922

2324/28840	And therefore Marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbé and not from the good abbé	71.82689666748047
2325/28840	And that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came   It was I the Comte de la Fere said Athos rising and bowing respectfully to the Duchess de Chevre	31.939695358276367
2326/28840	The duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter   Ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad Marie Michon fared better than she	71.73294830322266
2327/28840	Sit down dear count and go on with your	163.681396484375
2328/28840	At this point I have to accuse myself of a fault mad	110.72893524169922
2329/28840	I have told you that I was traveling on an important	59.20460510253906
2330/28840	At daybreak I left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion	444.04180908203125
2331/28840	In the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her	134.10403442382812
2332/28840	Her pretty face arrested my attention I approached and recognized that little Kitty whom our friend Aramis had placed with	391.9955749511719
2333/28840	In that way I discovered that the charming traveler was   Marie Michon said Madame de Chevreuse	42.99468231201172
2334/28840	Then I went out of the house I proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey	47.67667770385742
2335/28840	And have you never revisited that village eagerly asked Madame de Chevre	86.4389877319336
2336/28840	Well   I wanted to see the good curé	45.582183837890625
2337/28840	I found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all	97.87434387207031
2338/28840	A week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words 11 October 16	153.80426025390625
2339/28840	It was the date of that strange adventure interrupted Madame de Chevre	42.59269332885742
2340/28840	Yes but he couldnt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and Marie Michon had left his house before his	66.63516998291016
2341/28840	You must know monsieur that Marie Michon when she returned to France in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near	71.65616607666016
2342/28840	And what said the abbé asked Ath	21.595233917236328
2343/28840	That a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it	59.6698112487793

2346/28840	Take care madame said Athos for he knows neither his father nor his	52.96217727661133
2347/28840	You have kept the secret you have brought him to see me thinking to make me	58.08446502685547

2349/28840	Tomorrow I plunge into an adventurous affair in which I may be	97.1322250366211
2350/28840	Then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a	82.96124267578125
2351/28840	Rest assured cried the duchess I shall do what I	47.44939041137695
2352/28840	I have but little influence now but all that I have shall most assuredly be	95.42212677001953
2353/28840	As to his title and fortune   As to that madame I have made over to him the estate of Bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicom	33.39265060424805
2354/28840	Upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman But I am eager to see our young vicom	29.858238220214844

2356/28840	I will have him come in if you really wish	80.8561782836914
2357/28840	Athos moved toward the door the duchess held him	87.01646423339844
2358/28840	So he opened the door and beckoned the young man	20.28640365600586
2359/28840	The duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to	60.618892669677734
2360/28840	Vicomte come here said Athos the duchess permits you to kiss her	84.42644500732422
2361/28840	The youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down kissed the hand of the Duchess de Chevre	52.02682113647461
2362/28840	If I were I should do for you at once the most that you	86.25041961669922
2363/28840	But let us see whatever I may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to	143.50537109375
2364/28840	Athos standing looked at them both with indescribable	75.49433135986328
2365/28840	Madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentlemanthat of the	67.27401733398438
2366/28840	I have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention I believe of making me a soldier and he gave me reason to hope that at Paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the	41.57154083251953
2367/28840	Personally I am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between Madame de Montbazon my motherinlaw and Madame de Longue	24.19928741455078
2368/28840	But the Prince de Marsillac Yes indeed thats the right	59.10562515258789
2369/28840	The Prince de Marsillacmy old friendwill recommend our young friend to Madame de Longueville who will give him a letter to her brother the prince who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes	63.151123046875
2370/28840	You know Bragelonne said Athos I never speak without	52.3222541809082
2371/28840	Well comte I am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the Prince de Marsillac who is happily in Paris just	47.483909606933594
2372/28840	What are you going to do this evening   We intend to visit the Abbé Scarron for whom I have a letter of introduction and at whose house I expect to meet some of my	31.2318115234375
2373/28840	Tis well I will go there also for a few minutes said the duchess do not quit his salon until you have seen	40.46247100830078
2374/28840	There was once in the Rue des Tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of Paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich	87.15262603759766
2375/28840	There was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that	285.9007873535156
2376/28840	Nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all Paris went	77.63414764404297
2377/28840	It was the abode of the little Abbé Scar	18.630876541137695
2378/28840	The diminutive Abbé Scarron who however was an abbé only because he owned an abbey and not because he was in orders had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of Mans which he	100.58425903320312
2379/28840	On a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and	107.51936340332031
2380/28840	He had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to	127.19049835205078
2381/28840	He then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange	118.62255096435547
2382/28840	At first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the	115.1351547241211
2383/28840	As soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides Scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river but the water was icy	165.79263305664062
2384/28840	Scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself	193.83834838867188
2385/28840	Every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his	79.16632843017578
2386/28840	He had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to Paris where the fame of his wit had preceded	122.19403839111328
2387/28840	There he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting Anne of Austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a	62.966773986816406
2388/28840	Yes your majesty there is a title which I covet much replied Scar	110.79701232910156
2389/28840	And what is that   That of being your invalid answered Scar	86.06427001953125
2390/28840	So he was called the queens invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred franc	57.03175354003906
2391/28840	From that lucky moment Scarron led a happy life spending both income and	522.8414916992188
2392/28840	One day however an emissary of the cardinals gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so	43.46712112426758
2393/28840	And why asked Scarron is he not a man of good birth  	46.28001403808594
2394/28840	Witty   He has unfortunately too much	123.98285675048828
2395/28840	Well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man   Because he is an	25.77171516418457
2396/28840	Of whom   Of the	53.520328521728516
2397/28840	What answered Scarron I continue to receive Monsieur Gilles Despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another	58.89847183227539
2398/28840	Impossible   The conversation had rested there and Scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen Monsieur de Gondy only the more	72.37416076660156
2399/28840	It was on Thursday the abbés reception day people went there in	126.43163299560547
2400/28840	The cardinals refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehem	77.11459350585938
2401/28840	In the Rue Saint Honore Athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he	36.05244064331055
2402/28840	One of them hat in hand said to him   Would you believe it monsieur that contemptible Mazarin has stopped poor Scarrons	85.05944061279297
2403/28840	That is unreasonable said Athos saluting in his turn the two caval	38.06122970581055
2404/28840	It happens well that we are going there this evening said Athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor	62.8947868347168
2405/28840	Do gentlemen then make verses asked Raoul naively I thought it was	144.4507293701172
2406/28840	So it is my dear vicomte said Athos laughing to make bad ones but to make good ones increases famewitness Monsieur de Rot	52.496212005615234
2407/28840	Nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice I think it is better not to make	83.77003479003906
2408/28840	Then said Raoul this Monsieur Scarron is a poet   Yes you are warned vicom	26.75131607055664
2409/28840	Consider well what you do in that	55.72841262817383
2410/28840	Talk only by gestures or rather always	440.49505615234375
2411/28840	You will see me talking with one of my friends the Abbé dHerblay of whom you have often heard me	24.175918579101562
2412/28840	Come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not	48.68323516845703
2413/28840	That little stratagem may serve to keep off interl	257.28900146484375
2414/28840	Very well monsieur I will obey you at all	27.582443237304688
2415/28840	Athos made two visits in Paris at seven oclock he and Raoul directed their steps to the Rue des Tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and foot	73.80210876464844
2416/28840	Athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young	102.51920318603516
2417/28840	This was the Abbé Scarron always laughing joking complimentingyet sufferingand toying nervously with a small	132.7442626953125
2418/28840	Around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and	359.20458984375
2419/28840	Large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent	235.2280731201172
2420/28840	Two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the	244.0498809814453
2421/28840	On perceiving Athos Aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to Scar	45.94306182861328
2422/28840	Raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esp	88.24995422363281
2423/28840	After some minutes the door opened and a footman announced Mademoiselle Pau	26.946195602416992
2424/28840	Athos touched the shoulder of the vicom	124.3979721069336
2425/28840	Look at this lady Raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her King Henry	123.05315399169922
2426/28840	Every one thronged around Mademoiselle Paulet for she was always very much the	59.59181213378906
2427/28840	She was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as Raphael was fond of and Titian has painted all his Magdalens	138.13543701171875
2428/28840	This fawncolored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of La Lion	169.37171936035156
2429/28840	Mademoiselle Paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queenlike grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on Ra	101.56053924560547
2430/28840	Mademoiselle Paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her dont try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of Henry	84.22245788574219
2431/28840	When shall we two walk together Athos then said to Aram	125.56688690185547
2432/28840	Presentlythere are not a sufficient number of people here yet we shall be	211.4332733154297
2433/28840	At this moment the door opened and in walked the coadj	31.714515686035156
2434/28840	At this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated	196.9699249267578
2435/28840	He knew the Abbé de Gondy only by	42.535682678222656
2436/28840	He saw a little dark man ill made and awkward with his hands in everythingexcept drawing a sword and firing a pistolwith something haughty and contemptuous in his	158.49105834960938
2437/28840	Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his	68.51911163330078
2438/28840	Well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé   This was the orthodox	49.002437591552734
2439/28840	It had been said that evening a hundred timesand Scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved	104.65109252929688
2440/28840	Monsieur the Cardinal Mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he	23.966224670410156
2441/28840	But how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened I shall be obliged to make you a canon of Notre	50.468589782714844
2442/28840	Oh no cried Scarron I should compromise you too	129.1228790283203
2443/28840	Perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant   I shall borrow from the	64.26069641113281
2444/28840	But her majesty has no property interposed Aram	140.87937927246094
2445/28840	At this moment the door opened and Madame de Chevreuse was	15.149235725402832
2446/28840	Scarron turned his chair toward the door Raoul blushed Athos made a sign to Aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a	41.03116226196289
2447/28840	Is he then so ill dear Voiture asked Aramis half hidden by the window	125.18659973144531

2453/28840	You are unjust to a great poet it seems to me Raoul ventured to	46.111846923828125
2454/28840	A great poet come one may easily see vicomte that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen	111.92001342773438
2455/28840	A great poet he is scarcely five feet	348.4376525878906
2456/28840	Bravo bravo cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier bravo fair Paulet it is high time to put little Voiture in his right	198.57186889648438
2457/28840	For my part I always thought his poetry detestable and I think I know something about	103.84917449951172
2458/28840	Raoul turned and saw two faces just	490.5950927734375
2459/28840	One was perfectly charming delicate pensive shaded by beautiful dark hair and eyes soft as velvet like those lovely flowers the heartsease in which shine out the golden pet	310.9930114746094
2460/28840	The other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellowthe true type of a duenna or a devote	382.09588623046875
2461/28840	Meantime Aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his	85.89503479003906
2462/28840	Aramis notwithstanding his selfcontrol could not refrain from a slight movement of	58.721046447753906
2463/28840	Laugh then said Monsieur de Retz they are looking at	44.98509216308594
2464/28840	And leaving Aramis he went to talk with Madame de Chevreuse who was in the midst of a large	25.653064727783203
2465/28840	As soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gestic	100.24687957763672
2466/28840	Raoul then approached them as Athos had directed him to	168.76853942871094

2469/28840	Raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round Madame de Chevre	59.95347213745117
2470/28840	Well then asked Athos in a low	16.649351119995117

2475/28840	Aramis spoke so as to be heard by	134.71571350097656

2536/28840	His own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than	172.38021850585938

2540/28840	In recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that Raoul might suffer and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young	93.90696716308594
2541/28840	You are there sir he said	169.36767578125

2547/28840	Everything said Olivain to Athos has been done according to your directions the horses are	69.38219451904297
2548/28840	And I was asleep cried Raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these	85.20152282714844
2549/28840	Truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits   Therefore you love me a little I hope replied Athos in a tone of	60.191829681396484
2550/28840	Oh sir God knows how much I love revere	294.8480224609375
2551/28840	See that you forget nothing said Athos appearing to look about him that he might hide his	54.435546875
2552/28840	The servant then approached Athos and said hesitatingly   Monsieur le vicomte has no	30.255088806152344
2553/28840	Tis well said Athos I will take care of	22.706579208374023

2557/28840	Joy shone in Raouls eyes and he leaped lightly to his	57.39694595336914
2558/28840	Athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their	137.9002227783203
2559/28840	Raoul delighted at the counts companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this by	334.1368408203125
2560/28840	They set out passing over the Pont Neuf they pursued their way along the quay then called LAbreuvoir Pepin and went along by the walls of the Grand Chate	63.76809310913086
2561/28840	They proceeded to the Rue Saint	27.367584228515625
2562/28840	After passing through the Porte Saint Denis Athos looked at Raouls way of riding and observed   Take care Raoul I have already often told you of this you must not forget it for it is a great defect in a	52.93292999267578
2563/28840	See your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the	132.82733154296875
2564/28840	You hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre	136.70172119140625

2569/28840	I have remarked also another thing said Athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far out	119.50025177001953
2570/28840	This tension lessens the accuracy of the	778.8153686523438
2571/28840	So in twelve times you thrice missed the	227.54840087890625
2572/28840	Which you sir struck twelve times answered Raoul	235.6709747314453
2573/28840	Because I bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbowso do you understand what I mean   Yes	64.07227325439453
2574/28840	I have fired since in that manner and have been quite	101.09423828125
2575/28840	What a cold wind resumed Athos a wintry	243.0531005859375

2635/28840	It may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the ministertoward the subordinate and the	79.2818832397461
2636/28840	The only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableausuch is the instability of the human mindwas the sullen face of Grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his	132.45814514160156
2637/28840	It is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoners feverish	86.00630187988281
2638/28840	And so the good La Ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his	57.88748550415039
2639/28840	He had but one faulthe was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine	107.13430786132812
2640/28840	Now the successor of Pere Marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and Chambertin wine instead of Mac	62.24909591674805
2641/28840	He therefore looked forward to six oclock with as much impatience as the duke	55.77666473388672
2642/28840	Since daybreak La Ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of Pere Marte	42.95506286621094
2643/28840	The latter had surpassed himself he showed La Ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with Monsieur de Beauforts coatof	77.74884796142578
2644/28840	It was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near	104.7404556274414
2645/28840	La Ramees mouth watered and he returned to the dukes chamber rubbing his	119.5793228149414
2646/28840	To crown his happiness Monsieur de Chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence La Ramee was deputygovernor of the chate	34.694801330566406
2647/28840	As for Grimaud he seemed more sullen than	70.14031982421875
2648/28840	In the course of the forenoon Monsieur de Beaufort had a game of tennis with La Ramee a sign from Grimaud put him on the	22.440664291381836
2649/28840	Grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the	168.1727752685547
2650/28840	The game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when Monsieur de Beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so	81.42993927001953
2651/28840	There were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different	168.3653564453125
2652/28840	When they arrived Grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle	201.20986938476562
2653/28840	It was evident that there the rope ladder was to be	82.23579406738281
2654/28840	This manoeuvre transparent to the Duc de Beaufort was quite unintelligible to La Rame	19.351449966430664
2655/28840	The game at tennis which upon a sign from Grimaud Monsieur de Beaufort had consented to play began in the	46.062538146972656
2656/28840	The duke was in full strength and beat La Ramee	98.25853729248047
2657/28840	Four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis	108.60884094238281
2658/28840	When the game was over the duke laughing at La Ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis dor to go and drink his health with their four other	135.0463104248047
2659/28840	The guards asked permission of La Ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left	73.74491119384766
2660/28840	Six oclock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven oclock dinner was ready and served	83.7180404663086
2661/28840	Upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the dukes arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the	118.87838745117188
2662/28840	The rest of the dinner was to	101.39655303955078
2663/28840	Every one was impatient La Ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to	45.3107795715332
2664/28840	One might have fancied that Athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great	56.05307388305664
2665/28840	There were moments when looking at Grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for	130.581787109375
2666/28840	The prince looked at Grimaud Grimaud looked at the clock it was hardly a quarterpast	105.91519165039062
2667/28840	The escape was fixed to take place at seven oclock there was therefore threequarters of an hour to	52.2616081237793
2668/28840	La Ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his	69.79947662353516
2669/28840	It was Caesars Commentaries which La Ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor and La Ramee resolved never again to disobey these inj	67.69352722167969
2670/28840	Meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was	191.78480529785156
2671/28840	At halfpast six the duke arose and said very gravely   Certainly Caesar was the greatest man of ancient	76.23242950439453
2672/28840	You think so my lord answered La Rame	17.41200065612793
2673/28840	Well as for me I prefer	90.71756744384766
2674/28840	And why pray Master La Ramee asked the d	35.375694274902344
2675/28840	Because he left no Commentaries replied La Ramee with his coarse	51.0346794128418
2676/28840	The duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that La Ramee should seat himself	56.48292541503906
2677/28840	There is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so La Ramee when receiving his plate of soup from Grimaud presented a type of perfect	97.97903442382812
2678/28840	you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one	153.30079650878906
2679/28840	The duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of Grimaud who kept behind La Rame	33.49706268310547
2680/28840	My dear La Ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless	49.86792755126953
2681/28840	No my lord duke replied La Ramee in the fullness of his heart I say what I think there is no compliment in what I say to you   Then you are attached to me asked the d	25.391685485839844
2682/28840	To own the truth I should be inconsolable if you were to leave Vinc	103.98673248291016
2683/28840	A droll way of showing your aff	224.59280395507812
2684/28840	But my lord returned La Ramee what would you do if you got out Every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the Bastile instead of Vinc	76.91764068603516
2685/28840	Now Monsieur de Chavigny is not amiable I allow but Monsieur du Tremblay is considerably	20.25604248046875
2686/28840	Indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slown	104.37564849853516
2687/28840	Still by one of your forty methods your highness   Yes yes	47.108097076416016
2688/28840	My lord said La Ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your high	60.730655670166016
2689/28840	In ten minutes it would strike	220.62908935546875
2690/28840	Thank you La Ramee said the	21.948108673095703
2691/28840	Well my lord this famous invention of yours   Must I tell you replied the duke on what I most reckon and what I determine to try first   Yes thats the thing my lord cried his custodian g	84.807861328125
2692/28840	Well I should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like	149.76315307617188
2693/28840	Well   Having then a keeper like La Ramee I should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my	62.899105072021484
2694/28840	Come come said La Ramee thats not a bad	48.08893585205078
2695/28840	Capital isnt it for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to Mazarin as every gentleman ought to	163.11044311523438
2696/28840	Hush dont let us talk politics my	101.5135269165039
2697/28840	Then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and I should have news from those without the prison	111.48516845703125
2698/28840	Ah yes but how can the news be brought to you   Nothing easier in a game of tennis for	88.93730163574219
2699/28840	In a game of tennis asked La Ramee giving more serious attention to the dukes	49.161407470703125
2700/28840	Yes see I send a ball into the moat a man is there who picks it up the ball contains a	88.43028259277344
2701/28840	Instead of returning the ball to me when I call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a	81.27140808105469
2702/28840	Thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do	109.14637756347656
2703/28840	The devil it does The devil it does said La Ramee scratching his head you are in the wrong to tell me that my	64.00039672851562
2704/28840	I shall have to watch the men who pick up	196.6400604248047
2705/28840	But resumed La Ramee that is only a way of	39.65097427368164
2706/28840	And that is a great deal it seems to	20.80512237548828
2707/28840	Pardon me for instance I say to my friends Be on a certain day on a certain hour at the other side of the moat with two	57.43305969238281
2708/28840	Well what then La Ramee began to be uneasy unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch	79.53144073486328
2709/28840	I have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramp	39.82114791870117
2710/28840	Yes but answered La Ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes cant be sent around a ball like a	92.99848937988281
2711/28840	No but it may be sent in something	77.92321014404297
2712/28840	In something elsein something else In what   In a pate for	217.1381378173828
2713/28840	Let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my maitre dhotel Noirmont has purchased the shop of Pere Marteau   Well said La Ramee shudder	38.12714767456055
2714/28840	Well La Ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of Pere Marteau and proposes to me that I shall try	43.57044219970703
2715/28840	I consent on condition that La Ramee tries them with	59.36690139770508
2716/28840	That we may be more at our ease La Ramee removes the guards keeping only Grimaud to wait on	71.1762466430664
2717/28840	Grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in	226.67250061035156
2718/28840	The moment for my escape is fixedseven o	177.9063262939453
2719/28840	Well at a few minutes to seven   At a few minutes to seven cried La Ramee cold sweat upon his	34.94924545288086
2720/28840	At a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words I raise the crust of the pie I find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a	104.63871765136719
2721/28840	He was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to La Ramees heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his	38.319461822509766
2722/28840	Meanwhile Grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the	92.94918823242188
2723/28840	La Ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment	170.07272338867188
2724/28840	Oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you havent the heart to kill me   No not if thou dost not oppose my	43.97343826293945
2725/28840	But my lord if I allow you to escape I am a ruined	39.56568145751953
2726/28840	I will compensate thee for the loss of thy	193.4481201171875
2727/28840	You are determined to leave the chateau   By Heaven and earth This night I am determined to be	40.063987731933594
2728/28840	And if I defend myself or call or cry out   I will kill thee on the honor of a	63.57851028442383
2729/28840	Seven oclock said Grimaud who had not spoken a	38.67765426635742
2730/28840	La Ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his	80.10127258300781
2731/28840	The duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his	82.319091796875
2732/28840	Why bind thee   That I may not be considered as your accompl	68.183349609375
2733/28840	With your belt my lord replied La Rame	26.12883186340332
2734/28840	The duke undid his belt and gave it to Grimaud who tied La Ramee in such a way as to satisfy	40.909854888916016
2735/28840	La Ramee stretched out his legs Grimaud took a tablecloth tore it into strips and tied La Ramees feet	98.8353500366211
2736/28840	Now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire dangois	140.86253356933594
2737/28840	I ask for it without it I should be tried in a court of justice because I did not raise the	69.60842895507812
2738/28840	Thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it	321.0126647949219
2739/28840	Grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to	87.6476058959961
2740/28840	Now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that I have a wife and four	46.75724792480469
2741/28840	Rest assured put the gag in Grim	388.6800842285156
2742/28840	In a second La Ramee was gagged and laid pro	49.2120361328125
2743/28840	Two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a	86.97713470458984
2744/28840	At last they reached the tennis	229.41598510742188
2745/28840	No sentinels no one at any of the	55.213661193847656
2746/28840	The duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding	57.219818115234375
2747/28840	The duke exchanged a signal with	224.8438720703125
2748/28840	It was indeed for him that they were	46.389041900634766
2749/28840	Grimaud meantime undid the means of	634.9193115234375
2750/28840	This was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the	131.30970764160156
2751/28840	If I am caught I risk nothing but being taken back again to	125.98677062988281
2752/28840	If they catch thee thou wilt be	463.8583984375
2753/28840	And instantly Grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous	148.2095489501953
2754/28840	The duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary	59.305389404296875
2755/28840	He had gone down about threequarters of the length of the wall when the cord	63.44065856933594
2756/28840	The duke uttered a cry but Grimaud did not give a single	42.21827697753906
2757/28840	He must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he	61.979068756103516
2758/28840	Immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under Grimauds shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew Grimaud to	81.39217376708984
2759/28840	Descend my lord said the man in the mo	41.121498107910156
2760/28840	There are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is	183.9295654296875
2761/28840	The duke had already begun to	70.31298065185547
2762/28840	His task was the more difficult as there was no board to support	81.38728332519531
2763/28840	He was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty	51.423118591308594
2764/28840	But as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of	63.54883575439453
2765/28840	In less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the	26.762849807739258
2766/28840	He was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told	96.61347961425781
2767/28840	He let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any	180.96267700195312
2768/28840	He instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met De Roche	54.40103530883789
2769/28840	The other two gentlemen were unknown to	130.59567260742188
2770/28840	Grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a	271.408447265625
2771/28840	Gentlemen said the duke I will thank you later now we have not a moment to	93.93602752685547
2772/28840	The timely Arrival of DArtagnan in	105.17698669433594
2773/28840	At Blois DArtagnan received the money paid to him by Mazarin for any future service he might render the	58.85908508300781
2774/28840	From Blois to Paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but DArtagnan arrived on the third day at the Barriere Saint	53.74427795410156
2775/28840	DArtagnan and Planchet had hardly turned the corner when Porthos recognized	29.571462631225586
2776/28840	Thank God you have come   Eh goodday dear friend replied DArtagn	30.23007583618164
2777/28840	Porthos came down at once to the threshold of the	38.497528076171875
2778/28840	Ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses	210.4565887451172
2779/28840	Indeed said DArtagnan I am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine	30.194448471069336
2780/28840	The pretty Madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthoss words for she thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be	101.97942352294922
2781/28840	When will you do that   Immediately I	69.57865905761719
2782/28840	Ah so much the better   To that exclamation of Porthoss succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a	41.80268859863281
2783/28840	DArtagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of Mousqueton whose downdrawn mouth emitted sounds of	64.86136627197266
2784/28840	And you too my poor Monsieur Mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked DArtagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or	51.52379608154297
2785/28840	He finds the cooking detestable replied Porth	75.47025299072266
2786/28840	As for the cellar I have searched every part and poor stuff I	175.25885009765625
2787/28840	Monsieur Mouston said DArtagnan I should indeed condole with you had I not at this moment something very pressing to attend	42.54039764404297
2788/28840	Then taking Porthos aside   My dear Du Vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for I am going to take you to the card	36.45825958251953
2789/28840	Gracious me really exclaimed Porthos opening his great wondering	118.76976776123047

2805/28840	Ah said Mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit   Oh yes of course Mouston nothing	52.41044616699219
2806/28840	But to avoid risk put the pistols in the hol	138.76028442382812
2807/28840	You will find mine on my saddle already	360.5649108886719
2808/28840	Mouston breathed a sigh he couldnt understand visits of ceremony made under	440.4425354003906
2809/28840	Indeed said Porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right DArtagnan Mouston will do Mouston has a very fine	35.3524169921875
2810/28840	But you my friendare you not going to change your dress   No I shall go as I	44.59858322143555
2811/28840	This traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his	317.4820556640625
2812/28840	They set out on Vulcan and Bayard followed by Mousqueton on Phoebus and arrived at the Palais Royal at about a quarter to	40.93705749511719
2813/28840	Mousqueton also attracted attention and as the romance of Don Quixote was then the fashion they said that he was Sancho who after having lost one master had found	257.1192932128906
2814/28840	On reaching the palace DArtagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without	41.06945037841797
2815/28840	He was soon ordered to the presence of the	38.46456527709961
2816/28840	Courage he whispered to Porthos as they	73.82801818847656
2817/28840	Believe me the eye of the eagle is closed	340.28057861328125
2818/28840	We have only the vulture to deal	93.6248779296875

2821/28840	Good   Mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the	70.88814544677734
2822/28840	He saw DArtagnan and Porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his count	51.6787109375
2823/28840	Ah you is it Monsieur le lieutenant you have been very	48.582218170166016
2824/28840	Here I am at your eminences service as well as Monsieur du Vallon one of my old friends who used to conceal his nobility under the name of Porth	26.645153045654297
2825/28840	Porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of	46.97617721557617
2826/28840	The best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said DArtagn	31.773881912231445
2827/28840	Mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times Frederick of Prussia used to	583.6754760742188
2828/28840	He admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of Porth	157.3583984375
2829/28840	He seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and	149.13519287109375
2830/28840	He remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four	42.58584976196289
2831/28840	And your two other friends he	317.20257568359375
2832/28840	Porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn DArtagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his	41.79777908325195
2833/28840	They are prevented at this moment but will join us	172.14413452148438
2834/28840	And this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he	346.0675354003906
2835/28840	Yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for Monsieur de Bracieux is	29.381057739257812
2836/28840	Rich said Mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great	117.7049789428711
2837/28840	Fifty thousand francs a year said Porth	91.31819152832031
2838/28840	These were the first words he had	54.54656219482422
2839/28840	From pure zeal resumed Mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then   My lord has perhaps no faith in those words said DArtagn	88.226806640625
2840/28840	Have you Monsieur le Gascon asked Mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his	34.478759765625
2841/28840	I replied the Gascon I believe in devotion as a word at ones baptism for instance which naturally comes before ones proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of ones devotion something to	168.0216064453125
2842/28840	Now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a bar	72.42708587646484
2843/28840	Only that said Mazarin his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for Porthoss devotion without opening his purse only that That can be	117.12015533447266
2844/28840	I shall be baron explained Porthos stepping	134.00546264648438
2845/28840	I told you so said DArtagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence confirms	27.1317195892334
2846/28840	And you Monsieur DArtagnan what do you want   My lord said DArtagnan it is twenty years since Cardinal de Richelieu made me	15.575258255004883
2847/28840	Yes and you would be gratified if Cardinal Mazarin should make you	73.6100082397461
2848/28840	We will see gentlemen we will	163.36935424804688
2849/28840	Now Monsieur de Vallon said Mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country   Porthos opened his mouth to	28.679014205932617
2850/28840	My lord said DArtagnan Monsieur de Vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinarythat is to say enterprises that are considered mad and	67.3287353515625
2851/28840	That boastfulness was not displeasing to Mazarin he fell into	158.27859497070312
2852/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the	35.49898910522461
2853/28840	Well sir exclaimed Mazarin whats the matter and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded marketplace   My lord replied the messenger I wish to speak to your eminence in	47.062259674072266
2854/28840	I am Monsieur du Poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of Vinc	37.76687240600586
2855/28840	Mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that DArtagnan and Porthos should give	49.52047348022461
2856/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos withdrew to a corner of the	13.242501258850098
2857/28840	Speak monsieur speak at once said Mazarin What is the matter   The matter is my lord that the Duc de Beaufort has contrived to escape from the Chateau of Vinc	22.230344772338867
2858/28840	Mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the	110.45008087158203
2859/28840	He fell back almost fainting in his	49.361881256103516
2860/28840	Escaped Monsieur de Beaufort escaped   My lord I saw him run off from the top of the terr	28.469539642333984
2861/28840	And you did not fire on him   He was out of	73.75113677978516
2862/28840	Monsieur de Chavignywhere was he  	26.878124237060547
2863/28840	And La Ramee   Was found locked up in the prisoners room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near	62.62019348144531
2864/28840	But the man who was under him   Was an accomplice of the dukes and escaped along with	56.31210708618164
2865/28840	My lord said DArtagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious	26.01011085510254
2866/28840	It may still be possible to overtake the	146.20115661621094
2867/28840	France is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues	393.6398010253906
2868/28840	And who is to pursue him cried Maz	56.438446044921875
2869/28840	So would you said Mazarin looking with astonishment at those two	45.12602996826172
2870/28840	But the duke will not yield himself without a furious	118.83377838134766
2871/28840	Very well said DArtagnan his eyes aflame battle It is a long time since we have had a battle eh Porthos   Battle cried Porth	32.3042106628418
2872/28840	And you think you can catch him   Yes if we are better mounted than	60.8480224609375
2873/28840	Go then take what guards you find here and pursue	286.5797119140625
2874/28840	As for you my dear lieutenant I promise you nothing but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you	52.94538879394531
2875/28840	To horse Porthos said DArtagnan taking his friend by the	17.29621124267578
2876/28840	Here I am smiled Porthos with his sublime	83.19072723388672
2877/28840	They descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out To arms To arms and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the Rue Saint Honore with the speed of the	122.91316986083984
2878/28840	Well baron I promise you some good exercise said the Gas	42.216102600097656
2879/28840	As they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers	270.61627197265625
2880/28840	At the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean DArtagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get	92.80706787109375
2881/28840	The troop continued its course as though their steeds had	239.5582275390625
2882/28840	Alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the	141.32843017578125
2883/28840	The musketeers rode the whole length of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and of the road to Vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a	35.524391174316406
2884/28840	The horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step their nostrils reddened like glowing furn	328.7575378417969
2885/28840	DArtagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of Porthos two feet at the most Mousqueton followed two lengths behind the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective	62.85676574707031
2886/28840	From the top of an eminence DArtagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward Saint	34.70182418823242
2887/28840	He rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the	216.0174102783203
2888/28840	In five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by	66.85408020019531
2889/28840	The several members of that group were much	287.9250183105469
2890/28840	They looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the	89.384521484375
2891/28840	Their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conject	501.0752868652344
2892/28840	On the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened	73.83963012695312
2893/28840	A few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his	105.22228240966797
2894/28840	My officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop	64.34418487548828
2895/28840	That prohibition is not for me said DArtagn	45.576942443847656
2896/28840	Have the fugitives been pursued   Yes my officer unfortunately they are well	178.35533142089844
2897/28840	How many are there   Four and a fifth whom they carried away	247.06658935546875
2898/28840	Do you hear baron They are only four   A joyous smile lighted Porthoss	111.54595184326172
2899/28840	How long a start have they   Two hours and a quarter my	252.32571411132812
2900/28840	Two hours and a quarterthat is nothing we are well mounted are we not Porthos   Porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor	57.903995513916016
2901/28840	Very good said DArtagnan and now in what direction did they set out   That I am forbidden to	34.377315521240234
2902/28840	DArtagnan drew from his pocket a	13.90145206451416
2903/28840	And where is the governor   In the	39.09058380126953
2904/28840	Anger mounted to DArtagnans face he frowned and his cheeks were	103.58285522460938
2905/28840	Ah you scoundrel he said to the sergeant I believe you are impudent to me Wait   He unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked	45.623870849609375
2906/28840	Order of the king I tell	25.11854362487793
2907/28840	Read and answer or I will blow out your brains   The sergeant saw that DArtagnan was in	37.04728698730469
2908/28840	And by what gate did they go out   By the Saint Maur	98.73633575439453
2909/28840	If you are deceiving me rascal you will be hanged	103.3526382446289
2910/28840	And if you catch up with them you wont come back to hang me murmured the	119.57476043701172
2911/28840	DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and	23.46219253540039
2912/28840	This way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed	128.5261688232422
2913/28840	But now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double	44.438987731933594
2914/28840	It was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten	74.1339340209961
2915/28840	This last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace three of them stopped after an hours gallop and one fell	210.67276000976562
2916/28840	DArtagnan who never turned his head did not perceive	27.848712921142578
2917/28840	Porthos told him of it in his calm	93.45925903320312
2918/28840	If only we two arrive said DArtagnan it will be enough since the dukes troop are only four in	63.52436065673828
2919/28840	That is true said Porthos   And he spurred his courser	42.15361404418945
2920/28840	At the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their	118.67506408691406
2921/28840	Let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said Porth	120.0353775024414
2922/28840	Let us rather kill them yes kill them cried DArtagnan I see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this	74.89750671386719
2923/28840	In fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of	283.140869140625
2924/28840	They set out after a run of two leagues Mousquetons horse	596.9420166015625
2925/28840	Gracious me said Porthos theres Phoebus	59.16523742675781
2926/28840	The cardinal will pay you a hundred pist	56.91938400268555
2927/28840	Let us set out again at full gall	46.6183967590332
2928/28840	But at last the lieutenants horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last spur instead of making him advance made him	97.69576263427734
2929/28840	The devil exclaimed Porthos theres Vulcan found	133.4708709716797
2930/28840	Zounds cried DArtagnan then we must stop Give me your horse Porth	40.84960174560547
2931/28840	What the devil are you doing   By Jove I am falling or rather Bayard is falling answered Porth	37.24700927734375
2932/28840	What is it   I hear a	39.77413558959961
2933/28840	It belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking	164.24510192871094
2934/28840	No said DArtagnan it is in	14.20970630645752
2935/28840	That is another thing said Porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated by DArtagn	36.156829833984375
2936/28840	Monsieur said Mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on foot to rejoin his master Phoebus could no longer hold out and   Silence said Porth	32.254486083984375
2937/28840	In fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night	115.41146087646484
2938/28840	It is five hundred feet from here in advance said DArtagn	31.416601181030273
2939/28840	True monsieur said Mousqueton and five hundred feet from here is a small hunting	32.15730667114258
2940/28840	Good said DArtagnan seizing his own now you understand Porthos   Not too	29.785066604614258
2941/28840	We are out on the kings	130.18258666992188
2942/28840	Well   For the kings service we need	101.56402587890625
2943/28840	Then not a word but set to work   They went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some	88.76250457763672
2944/28840	Yonder is the house Porthos said the Gascon let me do what I please and do you what I	46.684207916259766
2945/28840	They glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine	104.75169372558594
2946/28840	A groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and brid	364.9955749511719
2947/28840	DArtagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps	46.292457580566406
2948/28840	I buy those horses he said to the	149.47386169433594
2949/28840	The groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no	54.63773727416992
2950/28840	Didnt you hear fellow   Yes I	166.38803100585938

2953/28840	And he took hold of one within his reach his two companions did the same	120.51311492919922
2954/28840	Sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an	72.49429321289062
2955/28840	Half an hours rest is enough replied the Gas	112.741455078125
2956/28840	A kind of steward appeared just as DArtagnan and his companions were prepared to	53.6025276184082
2957/28840	My dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word I will blow out your	53.79875183105469
2958/28840	But sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon   So much the better they must be good animals	22.535022735595703
2959/28840	And I mine Ive ten guards behind me dont you hear them gallop and Im one of the kings musket	139.40065002441406
2960/28840	They all mounted the horses as quickly as	132.64352416992188
2961/28840	Halloo hi hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines   On on cried DArtagnan therell be firing on   They all set off swift as the	97.22100830078125

2963/28840	Take care of your horses cried DArtagnan to	22.628345489501953
2964/28840	A gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the	55.11265182495117
2965/28840	Ah I understand replied Porthos she has ordered relays of	86.60368347167969
2966/28840	And we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left   My dear Porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said DArtagnan with a look as if he spoke against his	34.3359489440918
2967/28840	Pooh replied Porthos I am what I	23.508913040161133
2968/28840	They rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and	102.19258880615234
2969/28840	You are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said Porth	45.06838607788086

2971/28840	Ah ah have we overtaken them   Good a dead horse said DArtagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as	125.44252014160156
2972/28840	I seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed Porthos leaning over his horses man	54.281585693359375
2973/28840	Saddled   Yes saddled and brid	76.16558074951172
2974/28840	Courage we have them   But if they are numerous observed Mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have	70.26910400390625
2975/28840	Nonsense cried DArtagnan theyll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as were in pursuit theyll be afraid and will	122.90924072265625
2976/28840	Ah do you see cried the	43.59089279174805
2977/28840	The lights again this time I too saw them said Porth	96.24696350097656
2978/28840	On on forward forward cried DArtagnan in his stentorian voice we shall laugh over all this in five	87.119384765625
2979/28840	The horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the	86.09308624267578
2980/28840	They rode on in this way for ten	79.16666412353516
2981/28840	Suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horse	163.51882934570312
2982/28840	Aha cried DArtagnan theyre coming toward	82.1318359375
2983/28840	So much the worse for them said Porth	20.74462890625
2984/28840	Who goes there cried a hoarse	118.8023910522461
2985/28840	The three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were	89.69137573242188
2986/28840	Porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their	84.89395904541016
2987/28840	Who goes there was asked a second	215.87315368652344
2988/28840	Not a step forward or youre dead	494.50958251953125
2989/28840	Stuff cried Porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his	141.79257202148438
2990/28840	Stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our	238.61131286621094
2991/28840	Hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their	107.77545928955078
2992/28840	As for Porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from	98.02706909179688
2993/28840	Finish Mouston finish the work cried Porth	85.21440124511719
2994/28840	And he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh	164.40887451171875
2995/28840	Ive broken my mans skull cried DArtagn	85.04289245605469
2996/28840	And you   Ive only thrown the fellow down but hark   Another shot of a carbine was	145.28492736816406
2997/28840	It was Mousqueton who was obeying his masters	52.46366500854492
2998/28840	On on cried DArtagnan all goes well we have the first	75.50884246826172
2999/28840	Ha ha answered Porthos behold other players	211.2975311279297
3000/28840	And in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group they again disputed the	180.80734252929688
3001/28840	This time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to	82.76021575927734
3002/28840	Stand aside he cried stand off the road   What do you want asked a	67.88463592529297
3003/28840	The duke Porthos and DArtagnan roared out both at	24.842435836791992
3004/28840	A burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a gro	90.243408203125
3005/28840	DArtagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had	47.344852447509766
3006/28840	At the same time Porthos and his adversary fired on each other and DArtagnan turned to	22.7210636138916
3007/28840	What would you have my dear fellow One doesnt hit the bullseye every time it is something to hit inside the	199.59872436523438
3008/28840	Ho parbleau what is the matter with my horse   Your horse is falling said Porthos reining in his	53.92884063720703
3009/28840	In truth the lieutenants horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to	60.62701416015625
3010/28840	He had received in the chest the bullet of DArtagnans first	62.282230377197266
3011/28840	DArtagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the	33.94191360473633
3012/28840	Does your honor want a horse asked Mousqu	94.99093627929688
3013/28840	Heres one your honor   How the devil hast thou two horses asked DArtagnan jumping on one of	72.65898895263672
3014/28840	Their masters are dead I thought they might be useful so I took	162.8448944091797
3015/28840	Be on the qui vive cried DArtagn	30.86026954650879
3016/28840	As he spoke two horsemen advanced at full	125.13096618652344
3017/28840	Ho your honor cried Mousqueton the man you upset is getting	100.9902114868164
3018/28840	Why didnt thou do as thou didst to the first man said Porth	107.22334289550781
3019/28840	I held the horses my hands were full your	320.6565246582031
3020/28840	A shot was fired that moment Mousqueton shrieked with	87.06497955322266
3021/28840	Ah sir Im hit in the other side exactly opposite the other This hurt is just the fellow of the one I had on the road to Am	113.0495376586914
3022/28840	Mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the	135.03555297851562
3023/28840	On perceiving the cavaliers DArtagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh besides his horse he found had a carbine on the bow of the	54.40077590942383
3024/28840	Shall we wait or shall we charge   Let us charge them answered the Gas	68.35047149658203
3025/28840	They spurred on their horses the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from	99.39549255371094
3026/28840	The king has no authority here answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed from a cloud so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of	94.05018615722656
3027/28840	Tis well we will see if the kings name is not a passport everywhere replied the Gas	49.27473068237305
3028/28840	Two shots were fired at once one by DArtagnan the other by the adversary of Porth	38.04326629638672
3029/28840	DArtagnans ball took off his enemys	42.34884262084961
3030/28840	The ball fired by Porthoss foe went through the throat of his horse which fell gro	136.62208557128906
3031/28840	For the last time where are you going   To the devil answered DArtagn	20.193130493164062
3032/28840	Good you may be easy thenyoull get	242.99827575683594
3033/28840	DArtagnan then saw a musketbarrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his hol	38.70973587036133
3034/28840	He recalled a bit of advice which Athos had once given him and made his horse	50.547142028808594
3035/28840	The ball struck the animal full in	715.8148193359375
3036/28840	DArtagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one	57.031455993652344
3037/28840	Ah this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between	120.65721130371094
3038/28840	To the sword sir the sword   And he jumped off his	99.53270721435547
3039/28840	To the swords be it so replied DArtagnan that is exactly what I	40.05193328857422
3040/28840	DArtagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him	154.1236114501953
3041/28840	Twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one	196.36065673828125
3042/28840	Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting	383.06109619140625
3043/28840	At last DArtagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in	53.958160400390625
3044/28840	He brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove	93.48519897460938
3045/28840	Sdeath he cried with his Gascon	92.32591247558594
3046/28840	At this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the	122.74530792236328
3047/28840	As to DArtagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the	85.05003356933594
3048/28840	Have a care cried Porthos to his opponent Ive still two pistols	177.76744079589844
3049/28840	The more reason you should fire the first cried his	254.9934539794922
3050/28840	Porthos fired the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of	91.29933166503906
3051/28840	As the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two	75.26396942138672
3052/28840	Athos raised his sword DArtagnan lowered	92.41448211669922
3053/28840	Aramis cried Athos dont fire   Ah ha is it you Aramis said Porth	39.03554153442383
3054/28840	Aramis pushed his back into his saddlebags and sheathed his	98.60980987548828
3055/28840	My son exclaimed Athos extending his hand to DArtagn	13.084162712097168
3056/28840	This was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender	73.16871643066406
3057/28840	So you defend him And I who have sworn to take him dead or alive I am dishonoredand by you   Kill me replied Athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my	81.24962615966797
3058/28840	Oh woe is me woe is me cried the lieutenant theres only one man in the world who could stay my hand by a fatality that very man bars my	133.33016967773438
3059/28840	Fifty cavaliers cried the Gascon and Porth	129.28041076660156
3060/28840	Look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the d	78.55803680419922
3061/28840	The two friends looked to the right to the left they were encompassed by a troop of horse	56.823143005371094
3062/28840	Hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke I fancied you had about twenty men with you so I came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause but you are only	78.39563751220703
3063/28840	Yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said Ath	66.30004119873047

3066/28840	Some of the men moved toward	112.162353515625
3067/28840	One moment my lord whispered Athos and he said something in a low	40.763973236083984
3068/28840	I am too much indebted to you to refuse your first	43.68276596069336
3069/28840	Gentlemen he said to his escort	449.13336181640625
3070/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan Monsieur du Vallon you are	7.746151924133301
3071/28840	The order was obeyed DArtagnan and Porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large	24.185819625854492
3072/28840	Now DHerblay said Athos dismount and come	41.19996643066406
3073/28840	Aramis dismounted and went to Porthos whilst Athos approached DArtagn	18.865705490112305
3074/28840	Friends said Athos do you regret you have not shed our blood   No replied DArtagnan I regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each	39.23611831665039
3075/28840	Ah nothing will ever go well with us hereafter   Oh Heaven No all is over said Porth	109.88059997558594
3076/28840	Well be on our side now resumed Aram	142.36471557617188
3077/28840	Silence DHerblay cried Athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as	66.10589599609375
3078/28840	Tis a matter of conscience with them as with	206.74237060546875
3079/28840	Meantime here we are enemies said Porth	72.53848266601562
3080/28840	Gramercy who would ever have thought it   DArtagnan only	113.84904479980469
3081/28840	Athos looked at them both and took their hands in	81.06433868408203
3082/28840	Gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and	143.8688507080078
3083/28840	Yes we are severed there is the great the distressing truth But we have not as yet declared war perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is	182.80007934570312
3084/28840	For my own part I demand it said Aram	55.59339904785156
3085/28840	Let us choose a place of rendezvous continued Athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each	161.87716674804688
3086/28840	Well then the place   Will the Place Royale suit you asked DArtagn	37.416908264160156
3087/28840	Athos and Aramis looked at each	26.009262084960938

3094/28840	DArtagnan recognized the voice of De Roche	17.434185028076172
3095/28840	Can I do anything for you gentlemen asked the d	38.688480377197266

3098/28840	Adieu we shall meet soon I trust in Paris where you shall have your	118.72764587402344
3099/28840	The duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and	85.36763763427734
3100/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was Mousqueton and went up to	22.774953842163086
3101/28840	What do I see cried the	80.00171661376953
3102/28840	Grimaud is it thou   Grimaud signified that he was not	70.6103286743164
3103/28840	And whose horses are these cried DArtagn	32.46625518798828
3104/28840	Who has given them to us said Porth	31.35135269165039
3105/28840	Athos Athos muttered DArtagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman Whither art thou going Grimaud   To join the Vicomte de Bragelonne in Flanders your	37.719566345214844

3107/28840	It is IMousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the	81.30415344238281
3108/28840	Art thou dangerously wounded my dear Mousqueton he	253.52450561523438
3109/28840	What can we do said DArtagnan we must return to	15.31916332244873
3110/28840	I will take care of Mousqueton said Grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could Grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him	61.63187026977539
3111/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos went on meantime to	15.13448429107666
3112/28840	They were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of DArtagnan and Porth	27.91023826599121
3113/28840	Mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against	140.22499084472656
3114/28840	What consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase DArtagnan has done me one good turnhe has destroyed Brous	86.23233032226562
3115/28840	This Gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of	127.98291778564453
3116/28840	The cardinal referred to that man whom DArtagnan upset at the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean in Paris and who was no other than the Councillor Brous	30.376567840576172
3117/28840	The four old Friends prepare to meet	260.7632751464844
3118/28840	What are you eating there Porthos   I am dipping a biscuit in a glass of Spanish wine do the	51.849998474121094
3119/28840	Well how has all gone off   Zounds you know theres only one way of saying things so I went in and said My lord we were not the strongest	134.52378845214844
3120/28840	Yes I know that he said but give me the	54.52912139892578
3121/28840	You know Porthos I could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so I merely said they were fifty and we were	90.92218780517578
3122/28840	There was firing nevertheless I heard he said and your swordsthey saw the light of day I presume   That is the night my lord I	91.3409194946289
3123/28840	Ah cried the cardinal I thought you were a Gascon my friend   I am a Gascon said I only when I	36.883262634277344
3124/28840	The answer pleased him and he	442.2867736816406
3125/28840	Well theres nothing bad in that it seems to me said Porth	46.59853744506836
3126/28840	Oh mon Dieu no nothing at	139.09681701660156
3127/28840	It was the way in which he	37.801597595214844
3128/28840	It is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine They are veritable sponges Gimblou another	518.6752319335938
3129/28840	The bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration DArtagnan enjoyed in the	71.80560302734375
3130/28840	He continued   So I was going away but he called me	50.70041275024414
3131/28840	You have had three horses foundered or killed he asked	189.96148681640625
3132/28840	How much were they worth   Why said Porthos that was very good of him it seems to	52.064579010009766
3133/28840	Oh oh that is a large	122.80994415283203
3134/28840	If he knew anything about horses he would dispute the	172.39781188964844
3135/28840	Faith he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible	73.03005981445312
3136/28840	He made a great start and looked at	53.57936477661133
3137/28840	I also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in	101.88090515136719
3138/28840	For a thousand pistoles   For a thousand pistolesjust that amount the beggar not one too	75.53632354736328
3139/28840	And you have them   They are	39.54642105102539
3140/28840	Upon my word I think he acted very	131.93531799316406
3141/28840	Generously to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service   A great servicewhat was that   Why it seems that I crushed for him a parliament	83.79544067382812
3142/28840	What that little man in black that you upset at the corner of Saint Jean Cemetery   Thats the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the	53.514034271240234
3143/28840	It seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an	35.697200775146484
3144/28840	See that now said Porthos and I turned my horse aside from going plump on to him That will be for another	171.38111877441406
3145/28840	He owed me for the councillor the pettifogger   But said Porthos if he was not crushed completely   Ah Monsieur de Richelieu would have said Five hundred crowns for the	47.968345642089844
3146/28840	Well lets say no more about	149.18789672851562
3147/28840	How much were your animals worth Porthos   Ah if poor Mousqueton were here he could tell you to a	81.53038024902344
3148/28840	No matter you can tell within ten crown	374.9761047363281
3149/28840	Why Vulcan and Bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting Phoebus at a hundred and fifty we should be pretty near the	89.65216827392578
3150/28840	There will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said DArtagnan content	24.873353958129883
3151/28840	Yes said Porthos but there are the equip	35.62328338623047
3152/28840	Well how much for the equipments   If we say one hundred pistoles for the three   Good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and	51.543174743652344
3153/28840	We will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said DArtagnan and share the three	39.668312072753906
3154/28840	A paltry piece of business murmured DArtagnan crumpling his	67.6908187866211
3155/28840	Pooh said Porthos it is always	20.66234588623047
3156/28840	Stop I want to remember his exact	269.9068298339844
3157/28840	He said As to your friend tell him he may sleep in	165.69203186035156
3158/28840	Good very good said Porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a bar	46.16350555419922
3159/28840	Ah yes said Porthos there is nine o	25.773927688598633
3160/28840	We have a rendezvous you remember at the Place	58.08632278442383
3161/28840	Ah stop hold your peace Porthos dont remind me of it tis that which has made me so cross since	150.8671112060547
3162/28840	Because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our	81.92081451416016
3163/28840	And yet said Porthos neither of them had any advantage over	117.63333129882812
3164/28840	I still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in	186.2805633544922
3165/28840	We must go said the superb lord of Bracieux lest they should say we were	87.37503051757812
3166/28840	We who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the Place	80.17134857177734
3167/28840	Yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of	194.15304565429688
3168/28840	Athos and Aramis have played a game with me which alarms	191.50096130371094
3169/28840	We discovered yesterday the truth what is the use of going today to learn something else   You really have some distrust then said Porth	79.93940734863281
3170/28840	Of Aramis yes since he has become an abb	36.48038864135742
3171/28840	You cant imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he	101.79913330078125
3172/28840	He sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his	51.48258972167969
3173/28840	Ah as regards Aramis that is another thing said Porthos and it wouldnt surprise me at	35.04498291015625
3174/28840	Perhaps Monsieur de Beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on	23.557222366333008
3175/28840	Nonsense He had us in his power and he let us	142.0082244873047
3176/28840	Besides we can be on our guard let us take arms let Planchet post himself behind us with his carb	119.35002899169922
3177/28840	Devil take these civil wars one can no more now reckon on ones friends than on ones footmen said Porth	335.47772216796875
3178/28840	Ah if Mousqueton were here theres a fellow who will never desert me   So long as you are rich Ah my friend tis not civil war that disunites	85.13284301757812
3179/28840	It is that we are each of us twenty years older it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest whispers of ambition counsels of selfish	116.4657211303711
3180/28840	Yes you are right let us go Porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were	54.188968658447266
3181/28840	Halloo Planchet here saddle our horses take your carb	214.26361083984375
3182/28840	Whom are we going to attack sir   No one a mere matter of precaution answered the Gas	76.49679565429688
3183/28840	You know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor Broussel the father of the people   Really did they said DArtagn	44.02988052368164
3184/28840	He was carried home in the arms of the	49.86564636230469
3185/28840	His house has been full ever	250.641357421875
3186/28840	He has received visits from the coadjutor from Madame de Longueville and the Prince de Conti Madame de Chevreuse and Madame de Vendome have left their names at his	18.800395965576172
3187/28840	And now whenever he wishes   Well whenever he wishes   Planchet began to sing   Un vent de fronde Sest leve ce matin Je crois quil gronde Contre le Maz	161.6247100830078
3188/28840	Un vent de fronde Sest leve ce mat	200.41357421875
3189/28840	It doesnt surprise me said DArtagnan in a low tone to Porthos that Mazarin would have been much better satisfied had I crushed the life out of his	37.44414520263672
3190/28840	From Friquet I know that name   A son of Monsieur de Broussels servant and a lad that I promise you in a revolt will not give away his share to the	40.42219161987305
3191/28840	Is he not a singing boy at Notre Dame asked DArtagn	52.5510139465332
3192/28840	Yes that is the very boy hes patronized by Baz	254.56130981445312
3193/28840	Of what importance is this little reptile to you asked Porth	85.64195251464844
3194/28840	Gad replied DArtagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same	62.163700103759766
3195/28840	Whilst all this was going on Athos and Aramis were entering Paris by the Faubourg	42.86384582519531
3196/28840	They had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed	39.75088119506836
3197/28840	Bazin was their only attendant for Grimaud had stayed behind to take care of Mousqu	79.44378662109375
3198/28840	As they were passing onward Athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the	155.83267211914062
3199/28840	Oh no dear count cried Aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to   What do you mean Aramis   That the Place Royale is the termination to the main road to Vendomois and nothing	37.21920394897461
3200/28840	What our friends   Are become our most dangerous enemies Ath	150.71029663085938
3201/28840	Athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble	214.69406127929688
3202/28840	What can you expect Athos Men are so made and we are not always twenty years	117.22306060791016
3203/28840	We have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which DArtagnan is blindly	70.62679290771484
3204/28840	Did you not observe his despair on the journey As to Porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that	90.81173706054688
3205/28840	Well he found us on his road and will not be baron this	60.35942077636719
3206/28840	Perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this	115.67355346679688
3207/28840	But suppose they come unarmed What a disgrace to	509.27923583984375
3208/28840	Oh never fear besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents	174.45135498046875
3209/28840	Go in whatever guise you choose for my part I shall go	66.94563293457031
3210/28840	No for I will not allow you to do	22.340011596679688
3211/28840	Tis not one man not Athos only not the Comte de la Fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon	68.21834564208984
3212/28840	Be it so then replied Athos sorrow	92.74172973632812
3213/28840	And they pursued their road in mournful	227.3343048095703
3214/28840	They were waiting at the entrance of the Rue Sainte Catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the	62.492733001708984
3215/28840	Athos therefore commanded Bazin to fasten up his horse and that of Aramis in the same	87.57391357421875
3216/28840	They then advanced two and two and saluted each other	160.1879425048828
3217/28840	The gate is shut said Aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion I will get the key from the Hotel de Rohan and we shall be well	79.78681182861328
3218/28840	DArtagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the	30.140727996826172
3219/28840	Porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the	119.99858093261719
3220/28840	If you prefer any other place said Athos in his persuasive voice choose for	94.7273178100586
3221/28840	This place if Monsieur dHerblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the	46.81831359863281
3222/28840	Aramis went off at once begging Athos not to remain alone within reach of DArtagnan and Porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous	39.96091079711914
3223/28840	Aramis returned soon with a man from the Hotel de Rohan who was saying to him   You swear sir that it is not so   Stop and Aramis gave him a louis d	48.7436408996582
3224/28840	Ah you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his	29.598697662353516
3225/28840	Well one can never say what may happen at present we and these gentlemen are excellent	99.83163452148438
3226/28840	Yes certainly added Athos and the other	73.86466979980469
3227/28840	DArtagnan had heard the conversation and had understood	29.08140754699707
3228/28840	What do I see   That he wouldnt	54.77656936645508
3229/28840	Swear what   That man wanted Aramis to swear that we are not going to the Place Royale to	70.86860656738281
3230/28840	And Aramis wouldnt swear  	55.03130340576172
3231/28840	Attention then   Athos did not lose sight of the two	51.67107391357422
3232/28840	Aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that DArtagnan and Porthos might	29.084577560424805
3233/28840	Do you see whispered Aramis to Athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the Gascon wore under his	61.787086486816406
3234/28840	Alas I do replied Athos with a deep	48.37617111206055
3235/28840	He entered third and Aramis who shut the gate after him	265.5726013183594
3236/28840	The two servingmen waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective	249.25120544433594
3237/28840	They proceeded silently to the centre of the Place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the limet	88.38758087158203
3238/28840	There were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from Athos Porthos and DArtagnan sat down the two others stood in front of	42.50417709350586
3239/28840	After a few minutes of silent embarrassment Athos	169.68624877929688
3240/28840	Gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach	149.66163635253906
3241/28840	Hear me count replied DArtagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest	83.7937240600586
3242/28840	I wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or Monsieur dHerblay If so speak out answered Ath	56.143619537353516
3243/28840	You asked for candor and you have	77.07610321044922
3244/28840	You ask what I have against you I tell	73.77540588378906
3245/28840	And I have the same sincerity to show you if you wish Monsieur dHerblay I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived	34.452327728271484
3246/28840	Really monsieur you say strange things said Aram	33.594242095947266
3247/28840	You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them No you sounded me nothing	159.97344970703125
3248/28840	Very well what did I say to you that Mazarin was contemptible and that I wouldnt serve Maz	37.27993392944336
3249/28840	Did I tell you that I wouldnt serve any other On the contrary I gave you to understand I think that I adhered to the	36.163509368896484
3250/28840	We even joked very pleasantly if I remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my	134.3762664794922
3251/28840	Were you a party man There is no doubt of	116.66281127929688
3252/28840	Well why should not we too belong to a party You had your secret and we had ours we didnt exchange	287.8768615722656
3253/28840	So much the better it proves that we know how to keep our	108.67411041259766
3254/28840	I do not reproach you monsieur said DArtagnan tis only because Monsieur de la Fere has spoken of friendship that I question your	19.3048152923584
3255/28840	And what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked Aramis haught	62.02030944824219
3256/28840	The blood mounted instantly to the temples of DArtagnan who arose and replied   I consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of Jes	76.13722229003906
3257/28840	On seeing DArtagnan rise Porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each	59.0122184753418
3258/28840	Upon hearing DArtagnans reply Aramis seemed about to draw his sword when Athos prevented	68.21837615966797
3259/28840	DArtagnan he said you are here tonight still infuriated by yesterdays	66.23121643066406
3260/28840	I believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an	63.784908294677734
3261/28840	Come do you really think you have anything to say against me Say it then if I am in fault I will avow the	77.30770111083984
3262/28840	The grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of Aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of illhumor irritated	176.40835571289062
3263/28840	At that time I was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me However because I was prudent you must not take me for a	61.60075378417969
3264/28840	If I had wished to widen the breach between those whom Monsieur dHerblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder I could have spoken	54.86936950683594
3265/28840	What are you meddling with cried Aramis pale with anger suspecting that DArtagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with Madame de Longue	40.00639343261719
3266/28840	Porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a	120.06765747070312
3267/28840	He said yes and he put his hand on his	32.35761260986328
3268/28840	DArtagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his	88.07115936279297
3269/28840	Athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his	61.87270736694336

3271/28840	It must be done said Athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he	82.2171401977539
3272/28840	Then Aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent blade between his hands and then folding his arms stood trembling with	114.13614654541016
3273/28840	These proceedings made DArtagnan and Porthos draw	31.188217163085938
3274/28840	DArtagnan did not draw his sword Porthos put his back into the she	24.201906204223633
3275/28840	DArtagnan I have always loved you as my son Porthos we slept six years side by side Aramis is your brother as well as mine and Aramis has once loved you as I love you now and as I have ever loved	47.098934173583984
3276/28840	I repeat my words Aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old	90.28640747070312
3277/28840	There was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by Aram	260.5330810546875
3278/28840	I swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion I swear that I no longer bear animosity to those who were once my	121.79933166503906
3279/28840	I regret that I ever crossed swords with you Porthos I swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment now Athos	100.74362182617188
3280/28840	And he threw himself into the arms of Ath	20.768056869506836
3281/28840	My son exclaimed Athos pressing him in his	70.94731903076172
3282/28840	And as for me said Porthos I swear nothing but Im	41.888797760009766
3283/28840	Forsooth If I were obliged to fight against you I think I should allow myself to be pierced through and through for I never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest Porthos burst into tears as he embraced Ath	75.58589172363281
3284/28840	My friends said Athos this is what I expected from such hearts as	96.98628997802734
3285/28840	Yes I have said it and I now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent	143.98284912109375
3286/28840	I respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain	409.3172912597656

3288/28840	Yes replied DArtagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battlestandard that famous napkin of the bastion	58.22980499267578

3291/28840	And whenever added Athos we meet in battle at this word Place Royale let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest	113.80957794189453
3292/28840	And are the first of men added DArtagn	35.3849983215332
3293/28840	Gentlemen your hands are we not pretty good Christians   Egad said DArtagnan by Heaven	92.66980743408203
3294/28840	We should be so on this occasion if only to be faithful to our oath said Aram	48.54756164550781
3295/28840	Ah Im ready to do what you will cried Porthos even to swear by Mah	78.39788055419922
3296/28840	Devil take me if Ive ever been so happy as at this	196.39793395996094
3297/28840	And he wiped his eyes still	196.1818084716797
3298/28840	Has not one of you a cross asked Ath	64.99988555908203
3299/28840	Aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pear	92.73677062988281
3300/28840	Ah traitor muttered DArtagnan leaning toward Aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a Fronde	63.97726821899414
3301/28840	We hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to F	78.9854507446289
3302/28840	In losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal basilican Raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from Olivain the emotion his face might	100.36626434326172
3303/28840	With a full heart and burning head he desired Olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had	142.31109619140625
3304/28840	Very well sir said the host Ill give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the	71.30305480957031
3305/28840	Do as you like said Raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant	126.34719848632812
3306/28840	The host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the	212.5924530029297
3307/28840	By a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and Raoul began to	132.6958465576172
3308/28840	The host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of	149.54408264160156
3309/28840	Beauty has always been and always will be all	120.71768951416016
3310/28840	Hes not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to Olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no	126.27750396728516
3311/28840	My master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do he lost it the day before	245.78155517578125
3312/28840	I was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that I am sure I was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude I feel toward	95.36354064941406
3313/28840	You will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in	81.96540832519531
3314/28840	I entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if I may venture to tell you so I also feel	44.43655014038086
3315/28840	It seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which I did not dare to question you since you told me	68.51702880859375
3316/28840	I have therefore as you see great need of hearing from	173.25584411621094
3317/28840	Now that you are no longer beside me I am afraid every moment of er	63.53596115112305
3318/28840	You sustained me powerfully sir and I protest to you that today I feel very	192.8990478515625
3319/28840	During this time Olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses were also	210.2842559814453
3320/28840	Raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at Sen	140.4364471435547
3321/28840	The rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round	201.84852600097656
3322/28840	Let us try and overtake this gentleman said Raoul to Olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable	112.2261734008789
3323/28840	It was about four oclock in the afternoon when Raoul arrived at Compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of	44.20008850097656
3324/28840	He had stopped like Raoul at the Hotel of the Bell and Bottle the best at Compiegne and had started again on his journey saying that he should sleep at Noy	50.127132415771484
3325/28840	Well let us sleep at Noyon said Ra	29.913267135620117
3326/28840	Sir replied Olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this	76.17810821533203
3327/28840	I think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early	87.58042907714844
3328/28840	Eighteen leagues is enough for the first	275.71392822265625
3329/28840	The horses will have a long nights rest and at five oclock tomorrow morning we can be again on the	65.36852264404297
3330/28840	Olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master gr	495.44256591796875
3331/28840	Go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day tomorrow instead of journeying twenty leagues you will travel ten the day after tomorrow five and in three days you will be in	138.38258361816406
3332/28840	There you must rest young people are such bragg	224.20962524414062
3333/28840	It was easy to see that Olivain had not been taught in the school of the Planchets and the Grimaud	36.142459869384766
3334/28840	Raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of Athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twentyfive leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his	88.2178955078125
3335/28840	DArtagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with	49.95838165283203
3336/28840	A little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to	82.09953308105469
3337/28840	Raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for Oliv	120.81431579589844
3338/28840	At this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the	50.71686553955078
3339/28840	Raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his	109.01612854003906
3340/28840	Olivain he exclaimed what do I see below there   A second scream more piercing than the first now	250.1426544189453
3341/28840	Oh sir cried Olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is	81.78897094726562
3342/28840	But what do I see in the watersomething struggling   Oh yes exclaimed Raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider   They are sinking cried Olivain in his	54.91619873046875
3343/28840	Ah sir cried Olivain what are you doing Good God   Raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in	58.869102478027344
3344/28840	This was in fact a custom familiar to	87.01156616210938
3345/28840	Having been brought up on the banks of the Loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum	60.939579010009766
3346/28840	Athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undert	128.66677856445312
3347/28840	Oh heavens continued Olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now   The count would do as I do replied Raoul urging his horse vigorously	89.29127502441406
3348/28840	A man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but	93.28375244140625
3349/28840	Raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently	143.1410369873047
3350/28840	The nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms	96.51834869384766
3351/28840	One moment longer and all would	2426.54638671875
3352/28840	Courage cried Raoul courage   Too late murmured the young man too late   The water closed above his head and stifled his	61.42713928222656
3353/28840	Raoul at the same time seized one of the young mans hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning	58.07565689086914
3354/28840	Thus sure that the rider would not release his hold Raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with	158.41171264648438
3355/28840	All at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the	96.70570373535156
3356/28840	Saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched	633.2548217773438
3357/28840	A moment later the grayheaded man was beside	375.8711853027344
3358/28840	Olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the	101.17288970947266
3359/28840	Thanks to the attentions of Raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved	52.50664138793945
3360/28840	Ah sir he exclaimed it was you Without you I was a dead manthrice	110.31991577148438
3361/28840	But one recovers sir as you perceive replied Raoul and we have but had a little	89.27334594726562
3362/28840	Oh sir what gratitude I feel exclaimed the man with gray	136.2415313720703
3363/28840	Ah there you are my good DArminges I have given you a great fright have I not but it is your own	70.43894958496094
3364/28840	You were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim   Oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you I should never have dared to show myself to the marshal	27.709827423095703
3365/28840	But how did the accident happen asked Ra	247.9714813232422
3366/28840	Oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of	86.39049530029297
3367/28840	We were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat	91.43914031982422
3368/28840	Alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the	134.0738525390625
3369/28840	I cannot swim and dared not throw myself into the	80.23637390136719
3370/28840	Sir replied Raoul bowing I am entirely at your service I assure	25.93822479248047
3371/28840	I am called the Count de Guiche continued the young man my father is the Marechal de Grammont and now that you know who I am do me the honor to inform me who you	25.973548889160156
3372/28840	I am the Viscount de Bragelonne answered Raoul blushing at being unable to name his father as the Count de Guiche had	18.594451904296875
3373/28840	Viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already	204.80528259277344
3374/28840	Sir said Raoul returning the counts pressure of the hand I like you already from my heart pray regard me as a devoted friend I beseech	72.72672271728516
3375/28840	And now where are you going viscount inquired De Gu	46.4541130065918
3376/28840	To join the army under the prince	333.3112487792969
3377/28840	And I too exclaimed the young man in a transport of	56.70994567871094
3378/28840	Oh so much the better we will fire the first shot	100.44808197021484
3379/28840	It is well be friends said the tutor young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to	146.55453491210938
3380/28840	And now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom I gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the	76.07457733154297
3381/28840	Linen and wine are both being warmed	713.9651489257812
3382/28840	The young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very	106.31072235107422
3383/28840	They mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between	238.5306396484375
3384/28840	They were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent	744.0127563476562
3385/28840	De Guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than Raoul who was only	42.60551071166992
3386/28840	The halt at Noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound	296.7681579589844
3387/28840	Raoul had desired to be awakened should Grimaud arrive but Grimaud did not	186.70126342773438
3388/28840	Doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted	236.5402374267578
3389/28840	The Count de Guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by Raoul who came to wish him good	38.80827331542969
3390/28840	They breakfasted in haste and at six oclock had already gone ten	64.69558715820312
3391/28840	The young counts conversation was most interesting to Raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and	318.00341796875
3392/28840	Scarrons house he named to Guiche the people whom he had seen	242.460205078125
3393/28840	Guiche knew everybodyMadame de Neuillan Mademoiselle dAubigne Mademoiselle de Scudery Mademoiselle Paulet Madame de Chevre	40.59949493408203
3394/28840	Raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at Madame de Chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her	106.17095184326172
3395/28840	Then came the question of gallantry and love	141.14100646972656
3396/28840	Under this head also Bragelonne had much more to hear than to	113.96869659423828
3397/28840	He listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his	77.26753234863281
3398/28840	De Guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to	47.308372497558594
3399/28840	The young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and Cardinal Mazarin came in for his share of	180.3409881591797
3400/28840	The day passed away as rapidly as an	96.00297546386719
3401/28840	The horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at Arras at four oclock in the	57.5336799621582
3402/28840	They were approaching the scene of war and as bands of Spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of Arras they determined to remain in the town until the mor	65.70743560791016
3403/28840	The French army held all between PontaMarc as far as Valenciennes falling back upon Dou	360.72174072265625
3404/28840	The prince was said to be in person at Beth	86.85383605957031
3405/28840	An approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that movement only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached	168.56996154785156
3406/28840	The young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportune	163.7882843017578
3407/28840	The evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the	150.96548461914062
3408/28840	In the morning it was rumored that Prince de Condé had evacuated Bethune and fallen back on Carvin leaving however a strong garrison in the former	112.62227630615234
3409/28840	But as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward Bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to Carvin if	156.42005920410156
3410/28840	The counts tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of Lens and that of Beth	91.170166015625
3411/28840	They obtained information at Ablain and a statement of their route was left for Grim	275.07452392578125
3412/28840	About seven oclock in the morning they set	13.821340560913086
3413/28840	De Guiche who was young and impulsive said to Raoul Here we are three masters and three	103.30435943603516
3414/28840	Our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough	211.3023681640625
3415/28840	I have never seen him put to the test replied Raoul but he is a Breton which promises	91.30477142333984
3416/28840	Yes yes resumed De Guiche I am sure he can fire a musket when	98.73783874511719
3417/28840	On my side I have two sure men who have been in action with my	146.30604553222656
3418/28840	We therefore represent six fighting men if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them Raoul   Certainly sir replied the vis	133.20669555664062

3422/28840	Therefore leaving directions at every place for Grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the	108.92105102539062
3423/28840	The country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emer	158.44964599609375
3424/28840	Here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were	232.95822143554688
3425/28840	In anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band thus forming the advance	127.01292419433594
3426/28840	Himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst Olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the	77.3173599243164
3427/28840	They had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it Monsieur dArminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the counts two gro	58.72085189819336
3428/28840	The servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards	66.36029052734375
3429/28840	Olivain was at the same distance in the rear when suddenly there resounded five or six muskets	101.13935852050781
3430/28840	The tutor cried halt the young men obeyed pulling up their steeds and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gall	57.381649017333984
3431/28840	The young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the	124.22808837890625
3432/28840	Were you stopped eagerly inquired the two	277.1821594238281
3433/28840	No replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your	48.08878707885742
3434/28840	My advice is this said Monsieur dArminges and if needs be my will that we beat a	67.38729095458984

3439/28840	The two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistolshot and cries for help were	55.18647384643555
3440/28840	Whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready	506.1793212890625
3441/28840	In five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced	94.24803161621094
3442/28840	Hush whispered De Guiche these are caval	144.513427734375

3444/28840	Can you see what they are doing   Yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead	57.803466796875
3445/28840	It is some cowardly assassination said De Gu	75.38788604736328

3450/28840	The men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered	160.55563354492188
3451/28840	De Guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the Spaniard who had advanced to meet Raoul aimed in his turn and Raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a	77.93257141113281
3452/28840	He let off his fire at but four p	224.9060516357422
3453/28840	Struck in the breast and extending his arms the Spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him	72.3064193725586
3454/28840	Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of Athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was	69.82404327392578
3455/28840	His horse bounded to one side losing its footing and fell entangling Raouls leg under its	286.0214538574219
3456/28840	The Spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle in order to strike Raoul on the head with the	77.68421173095703

3458/28840	The butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound Guiche reached the Spaniard and placed a pistol at his	78.3892822265625

3460/28840	Guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached Ra	112.77043151855469
3461/28840	Faith sir said Raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to	64.42705535888672
3462/28840	Without your aid continued he repeating the counts words I should have been a dead manthrice	99.94956970214844
3463/28840	My antagonist took flight replied De Guiche and left me at liberty to come to your	101.3757553100586
3464/28840	But are you seriously wounded I see you are covered with blood   I believe said Raoul that I have got something like a scratch on the	53.953651428222656

3467/28840	At last Raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal and in a second he was on his feet	108.90843200683594
3468/28840	Faith no thank Heaven replied Raoul but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering   I fear we arrived too	50.581703186035156
3469/28840	They have killed them I think and taken flight carrying off their boot	350.7541198730469
3470/28840	Let us go and see whether they are quite dead or if they can still be helped suggested Ra	80.77930450439453

3472/28840	Take for yourself the better of the two and give me	99.6678695678711
3473/28840	They approached the spot where the unfortunate victims	167.947998046875
3474/28840	Two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth this one was	96.76202392578125

3476/28840	He had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the	127.751220703125

3484/28840	Where you can be relieved asked De Gu	46.571014404296875
3485/28840	But perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said Ra	52.875274658203125

3487/28840	Are you a surgeon asked De Gu	33.25149154663086
3488/28840	No but I know a little about wounds and mine I know is	167.84552001953125
3489/28840	Try therefore either to carry me to some place where I may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me	103.42254638671875
3490/28840	It is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is	87.1544189453125

3495/28840	My God my God Good God good God added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder you will not allow that that would be too terrible   Calm yourself sir replied De Gu	54.129173278808594

3508/28840	The two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the	68.53502655029297
3509/28840	Raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything need	86.63710021972656
3510/28840	He desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the	238.9125518798828
3511/28840	The host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward Gre	256.2937316894531
3512/28840	Chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously	246.317626953125
3513/28840	He was a man about twentytwo or twentythree years old but who appeared much older from ascetic	94.7852554321289
3514/28840	Sir began Raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic   Why do you ask me that replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely	32.87858200073242
3515/28840	Because we want to know said De Guiche haught	33.67687225341797
3516/28840	The stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his	160.2422637939453
3517/28840	In a second De Guiche had sprung before him and barred his	94.3541030883789
3518/28840	Answer sir exclaimed he you have been asked politely and every question is worth an	163.8007049560547
3519/28840	I suppose I am free to say or not to say who I am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask	65.2891845703125
3520/28840	It was with difficulty that De Guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monks	161.67234802246094
3521/28840	In the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the Viscount of Bragelonne and I am the Count de Gu	31.49634552001953
3522/28840	Nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the	104.41616821289062
3523/28840	The pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that Raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an	84.42752838134766
3524/28840	He is some Spanish or Flemish spy said he putting his hand to his	79.54681396484375
3525/28840	A glance threatening and transient as lightning replied to Ra	283.4557800292969
3526/28840	Well sir said De Guiche are you going to reply   I am a priest said the young	15.448768615722656
3527/28840	Then father said Raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your v	87.40524291992188
3528/28840	At the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of	78.14665222167969
3529/28840	The monks eye again flashed but that was all he merely repeated his phrase I will goand he	377.9653625488281
3530/28840	Let us follow him said De Guiche it will be the surest	64.73381805419922
3531/28840	I was about to propose so doing answered De Bragel	32.17861557006836
3532/28840	In the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or	77.54450225830078
3533/28840	You see said Raoul we have done	70.94725036621094
3534/28840	What a horrible face that monk has said De Gu	143.50949096679688
3535/28840	Well said Raoul the poor man will get his priest but by Heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the conf	72.93881225585938
3536/28840	I confess I am accustomed to priests of a very different	103.0802230834961
3537/28840	Ah exclaimed De Guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from Heaven on them they are mostly foreignersScotch Irish or	97.56954956054688
3538/28840	As ugly   No but reasonably	330.2237243652344
3539/28840	What a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar   Pshaw said De Gu	40.19649124145508
3540/28840	Absolution comes not from him who administers it but from	345.23883056640625
3541/28840	However for my part I would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a conf	82.19439697265625
3542/28840	You are of my opinion are you not viscount and I see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy fathers	58.902069091796875
3543/28840	Yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but I feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder	43.30037307739258
3544/28840	Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path   Never answered De Gu	64.98309326171875
3545/28840	Well I vow I felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said Why do you ask me that and looked so strangely at	141.70672607421875
3546/28840	Then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels   Faith yes almost said Ra	96.01396179199219
3547/28840	They had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by Monsieur dArming	44.096588134765625
3548/28840	There is the wounded man said De Guiche passing close to the Augustine	71.19189453125
3549/28840	Be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur	139.75965881347656
3550/28840	As for Raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in rep	123.74913787841797
3551/28840	The young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the	45.64129638671875
3552/28840	He raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by	84.77801513671875
3553/28840	And now said the youths we have done all we can for you and as we are in haste to rejoin the princes army we must continue our	67.49514770507812

3565/28840	The litter borne by two servants now entered the	384.1646423339844
3566/28840	The host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the	84.63495635986328
3567/28840	At sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husbands	280.39984130859375

3574/28840	Render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritor	97.90645599365234
3575/28840	The monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a	73.97686767578125
3576/28840	DArminges and Olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin Raoul and his	49.75651550292969
3577/28840	Just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the	60.13611602783203
3578/28840	What does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just	109.95397186279297
3579/28840	The traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing	51.46875762939453
3580/28840	Ah diable said the host to himself this man seems	220.36802673339844
3581/28840	And where will your worship drink   There answered the traveler pointing to the	142.14492797851562
3582/28840	I was mistaken said the host hes not quite	120.10855102539062
3583/28840	And what else does your worship wish for   To know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom   The Viscount de Bragelonne   Just	25.492019653320312
3584/28840	Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud   The traveler made a sign of ass	20.354690551757812
3585/28840	Well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at Mazingarbe and sleep at Cambr	56.75087356567383
3586/28840	How far is Mazingarbe   Two miles and a	94.25508880615234
3587/28840	Grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying	99.09664154052734
3588/28840	What is that said he whence comes that cry   From the wounded mans room replied the	125.82412719726562
3589/28840	What wounded man   The former executioner of Bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by Spaniards and who is now being confessed by an Augustine fri	51.45893096923828
3590/28840	The old executioner of Bethune muttered Grimaud a man between fiftyfive and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard   That is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you know him asked the	78.52320861816406
3591/28840	I have seen him once replied Grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of	99.19658660888672
3592/28840	At this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was	126.30604553222656
3593/28840	The three listeners looked at one another in	333.9917297363281
3594/28840	We must see what it is said Grim	39.47206115722656
3595/28840	It sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the	69.92342376708984
3596/28840	Mon Dieu said the woman crossing	648.6292114257812
3597/28840	If Grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other	64.88370513916016
3598/28840	Open the door cried the host open it instantly sir monk   No	198.22174072265625
3599/28840	Unfasten it or I will break it in said Grim	142.3577117919922
3600/28840	The same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design Grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the	106.2022933959961
3601/28840	The room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had	163.9730987548828
3602/28840	The monk cried the host where is the monk   Grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the	66.78913879394531
3603/28840	He has escaped by this means exclaimed	103.16106414794922
3604/28840	Do you think so said the host bewildered boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the	102.44107055664062
3605/28840	There is no mule cried he to whom this question was	107.74600982666016
3606/28840	The host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst Grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the	79.06982421875
3607/28840	There can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said	50.520263671875
3608/28840	Does he still live inquired the inn	192.1222686767578
3609/28840	Making no reply Grimaud opened the poor mans jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and Grimaud becoming pall	93.45712280273438
3610/28840	The blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the execution	46.01239776611328
3611/28840	Run run for help cried Grimaud and I will remain beside him	88.71646118164062
3612/28840	The host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husbands	65.69894409179688
3613/28840	This is what had taken place We have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a	62.76506042480469
3614/28840	Perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing	108.89799499511719
3615/28840	He was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their	98.75106811523438
3616/28840	And besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much illwill to follow to the end his role as conf	171.71856689453125
3617/28840	The monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded	52.505126953125
3618/28840	The executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to	52.79544448852539
3619/28840	He made a movement of surprise and said   Father you are very	35.27789306640625
3620/28840	Men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dry	312.99188232421875
3621/28840	Alas speak to me more gently father in my last moments I need a	187.0412139892578
3622/28840	Do you suffer much asked the	184.30780029296875
3623/28840	Yes but in my soul much more than in my	108.62763977050781
3624/28840	I still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myselfno	573.1839599609375
3625/28840	Tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed began to be interested in a story so strangely	85.49453735351562
3626/28840	That is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession I have distributed to the poor I have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing	97.78300476074219
3627/28840	All have forgiven me some have even loved me but I think that God has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night I see that womans ghost rising before	109.23384857177734
3628/28840	A woman You have assassinated a woman then cried the	185.16481018066406

3630/28840	The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed eagerly   Go on I know nothing as yet when you have finished your story God and I will	93.02141571044922
3631/28840	The executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his	42.42462921142578
3632/28840	Delirium he repeated delirium do you say Oh no I remember too	102.33527374267578
3633/28840	It was evening I had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which I in my pride	159.16873168945312
3634/28840	After being the instrument of human justice I aspired to be that of the justice of	104.18262481689453
3635/28840	But let me see how was it done Speak said the	96.86408996582031
3636/28840	A man came to me and showed me an order and I followed	89.92622375488281
3637/28840	I reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem	401.11431884765625
3638/28840	We traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without	244.34669494628906
3639/28840	At length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said there is the person to be	77.98316955566406
3640/28840	And you obeyed   Father that woman was a	84.93047332763672
3641/28840	It was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinate her brotherinlaw she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving England she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be	86.32316589355469
3642/28840	The woman was English then   No she was French but she had married in	183.08001708984375
3643/28840	The monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the	144.50192260742188
3644/28840	The executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his	77.65898895263672
3645/28840	No no I am here said the monk quickly coming back to	119.88465118408203

3651/28840	I have never understood how I could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so	175.04403686523438
3652/28840	The monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not	175.2954559326172
3653/28840	At length with a violent effort at selfcontrol   The name of that woman he	38.33680725097656

3658/28840	Oh yes it is she   A voice of strange sweetness   How do you know it   The executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became l	27.40996551513672
3659/28840	And you killed her the monk	461.3736572265625
3660/28840	She had fled with him from her	141.18954467773438

3663/28840	Yes yes he said I will pardon you if you tell me	32.03765869140625

3671/28840	Her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name Speak or no absolution   The dying man collected all his	133.21812438964844
3672/28840	Anne de Bueil murmured the wounded	20.230613708496094
3673/28840	Anne de Bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to	65.40762329101562

3684/28840	The executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his	70.96119689941406
3685/28840	Grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his	67.61271667480469
3686/28840	Help help he murmured oh God have I not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die   Take courage said Grimaud they are gone to find	82.28828430175781
3687/28840	Who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on Grim	137.08717346191406
3688/28840	You and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before	65.07586669921875
3689/28840	Under what circumstances did we meet he asked	188.44151306152344
3690/28840	One night twenty years ago my master fetched you from Bethune and conducted you to Armentie	140.3252716064453
3691/28840	I know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four gro	34.08211135864258
3692/28840	Where do you come from now   I was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my	77.0545654296875
3693/28840	They told me the executioner of Bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing	73.46759796142578
3694/28840	At the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it	112.84429168701172
3695/28840	And the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk   What monk   The monk that was shut in with	65.2618179321289
3696/28840	No he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the	52.69426345825195
3697/28840	Was he the man that stabbed you   Yes said the execution	44.871726989746094
3698/28840	Grimaud moved as if to leave the	235.05999755859375
3699/28840	What are you going to do asked the wounded	15.603554725646973
3700/28840	Do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done	158.2386932373047
3701/28840	Now I may hope that God will forgive me since my crime is exp	112.42462158203125
3702/28840	The woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill   Milady   Yes Milady it is true you called her	101.5660629272461
3703/28840	What has the monk to do with this Milady   She was his	49.94940948486328
3704/28840	Grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden	191.79969787597656
3705/28840	But does he know this secret then   I mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in	86.46178436279297
3706/28840	Grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the	155.65748596191406
3707/28840	Touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn I shall	63.02159118652344
3708/28840	Grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed   Oh if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is	111.45970153808594
3709/28840	Haste haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his friends	148.26611328125
3710/28840	My death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misad	42.24478530883789
3711/28840	Where was the monk going asked Grim	201.95394897460938
3712/28840	Who stopped him   Two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom I heard his companion mentionthe Viscount de Bragel	42.77620315551758
3713/28840	And it was this young man who brought the monk to you Then it was the will of God that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued Grim	74.81797790527344
3714/28840	And yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so   On ones deathbed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with ones own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his	128.4887237548828
3715/28840	Grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the Comte de la F	47.26258850097656
3716/28840	Whilst he thus hesitated the host reentered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the	198.78672790527344
3717/28840	The surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have f	71.68897247314453
3718/28840	We must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant	124.29047393798828
3719/28840	The prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to Grimaud who turned away his	51.03573989868164
3720/28840	The weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly fright	80.29094696044922
3721/28840	Then Grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his	76.56660461425781
3722/28840	Raoul was seated at table with the Count de Guiche and his tutor when all at once the door opened and Grimaud presented himself travelstained dirty and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy execution	60.89786148071289
3723/28840	Grimaud my good Grimaud exclaimed Raoul here you are at last Excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a	79.0528564453125
3724/28840	How did you leave the count continued	65.02114868164062

3726/28840	You knew him and he is dead  	25.48926544189453
3727/28840	Well sir said DArminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not	61.12936019897461
3728/28840	I had a bad opinion of him the moment I saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would	111.69561004638672
3729/28840	At the mention of the monk Grimaud became	71.65107727050781
3730/28840	Come come continued DArminges to dinner for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a rep	99.66606140136719
3731/28840	Come Grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can	155.07421875
3732/28840	I cannot stop a moment I must start for Paris again	162.76324462890625
3733/28840	What You start for Paris You are mistaken it is Olivain who leaves me you are to	85.39727783203125
3734/28840	On the contrary Olivain is to stay and I am to	99.46082305908203
3735/28840	I have come for nothing else but to tell you	46.286258697509766
3736/28840	But what is the meaning of this change   I cannot tell	25.59089469909668
3737/28840	Come tell me what is the joke   Monsieur le vicomte knows that I never	26.53404426574707
3738/28840	Yes but I know also that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that Olivain should return to	20.889516830444336
3739/28840	Perhaps you mean to disobey me   Yes monsieur I	16.459453582763672
3740/28840	You persist then   Yes I am going may you be happy monsieur and Grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go	40.34957504272461
3741/28840	Raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the	115.6092529296875
3742/28840	Grimaud he cried remain I wish	560.5050659179688
3743/28840	Then replied Grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be	17.43109893798828
3744/28840	He saluted and made a movement to	121.09427642822266
3745/28840	Grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety Speak speak in Heavens name And Raoul fell back trembling upon his	103.21267700195312
3746/28840	I can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my	44.266517639160156
3747/28840	You met a monk did you not  	51.454830169677734
3748/28840	The young men looked at each other with an expression of	19.563861846923828
3749/28840	You conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet	58.8657341003418
3750/28840	And without adding another word Grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the	68.63951873779297
3751/28840	Two minutes later the thunder of a horses hoofs was heard upon the road it was Grimaud on his way to	80.68952178955078
3752/28840	When once in the saddle Grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no	92.28858184814453
3753/28840	But Grimauds ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post	113.83367156982422
3754/28840	Raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out The Spaniards the Spaniards   That cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccup	99.9172134399414
3755/28840	The young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of Houdin and Beth	128.6729736328125
3756/28840	While Monsieur dArminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of Marsin and of Lens a large body of infantry and	49.943031311035156
3757/28840	This time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire	86.57366943359375
3758/28840	There was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of Monsieur dArminges and beat a	43.5537223815918
3759/28840	Olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the Count de Guiche guarded carefully between them the Spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his	112.89541625976562
3760/28840	As a further precaution they had bound his	302.07843017578125
3761/28840	The little company started off at a trot on the road to Cambrin where they expected to find the	67.83790588378906
3762/28840	But he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to La Bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemys	64.80541229248047
3763/28840	He questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been	136.4109344482422
3764/28840	The hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of	145.4314422607422
3765/28840	Now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely	188.3600311279297
3766/28840	The prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to Marshal de Grammont that some one wished to see	91.36177825927734
3767/28840	The Duc de Grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went	64.04503631591797
3768/28840	The prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing	73.58059692382812
3769/28840	Suddenly a dull and heavy noise was	146.95167541503906
3770/28840	The prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking itit was the noise of	84.04843139648438
3771/28840	The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the	74.85801696777344
3772/28840	Speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them first speak we shall have time afterward for the usual	278.7637939453125
3773/28840	The most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is	184.58570861816406
3774/28840	It fell naturally to the Count de Guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his	76.8855972290039
3775/28840	Besides he had long known the prince whilst Raoul now saw him for the first	53.51597595214844
3776/28840	He therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at Mazingar	50.64982604980469
3777/28840	Meanwhile Raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of Rocroy Fribourg and Nordling	162.0575714111328
3778/28840	At the first words of the Count de Guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood	88.4219741821289
3779/28840	The enemy was marching upon Lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from France the army of	185.24111938476562
3780/28840	But in what force was the enemy Was it a corps sent out to make a diversion Was it an entire army To this question De Guiche could not	159.1901397705078
3781/28840	Now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise	360.7113952636719
3782/28840	Certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a	115.47906494140625
3783/28840	My lord said Raoul blushing might examine the Spanish	79.45075225830078
3784/28840	Have you a Spanish prisoner cried the	141.57644653320312
3785/28840	Ah that is true said De Guiche I had forgotten	22.545644760131836
3786/28840	That is easily understood it was you who took him count said Raoul	95.20056915283203
3787/28840	The old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed   The young man is right let the prisoner be brought	89.66986846923828
3788/28840	Meanwhile the prince took De Guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man	66.53490447998047
3789/28840	Monsieur said the prince turning toward Raoul I know that you have a letter from my sister Madame de Longueville but I see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good	34.940467834472656
3790/28840	My lord said Raoul coloring up I did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the	46.12096405029297
3791/28840	Very well said the prince give it to me	75.97571563720703
3792/28840	Here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most	116.63194274902344
3793/28840	The prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spo	238.95448303222656
3794/28840	Since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he	42.999542236328125
3795/28840	The prince looked at him with unspeakable	62.07439041137695
3796/28840	Of what country are you asked the	94.05104064941406
3797/28840	The prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign	155.89866638183594
3798/28840	Ah ah it seems that he is a Spani	65.46597290039062
3799/28840	Do you speak Spanish Grammont   Faith my lord but indifferent	52.07120895385742
3800/28840	And I not at all said the prince	64.90535736083984
3801/28840	Gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak Spanish and serve me as interpreter   I can my lord said Ra	70.86583709716797
3802/28840	Ah you speak Spanish   Enough I think to fulfill your highnesss wishes on this	79.14794158935547
3803/28840	Meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking	52.55647659301758
3804/28840	My lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest Cast	76.84693145751953
3805/28840	Ich bin ein Deutscher replied the	3395.96923828125
3806/28840	What in the devil does he say asked the	51.14480209350586
3807/28840	What new gibberish is that   He says he is German my lord replied Raoul but I doubt it for his accent is bad and his pronunciation	119.50242614746094
3808/28840	Then you speak German also asked the	221.0800323486328
3809/28840	Well enough to question him in that language   Yes my	32.58755874633789
3810/28840	Raoul began the examination but the result justified his	473.7168273925781
3811/28840	The prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what Raoul said to him and Raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of Flemish and Alsat	90.3895263671875
3812/28840	However amidst all the prisoners efforts to elude a systematic examination Raoul had recognized his natural	254.6708221435547
3813/28840	Non siete Spagnuolo he said non siete Tedesco siete Italian	573.9801635742188
3814/28840	The prisoner started and bit his	231.00914001464844
3815/28840	Ah that said the prince I understand that language thoroughly and since he is Italian I will myself continue the	165.63792419433594
3816/28840	Thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and I appoint you from this moment my	75.75938415527344
3817/28840	But the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in Italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the	117.32550048828125
3818/28840	Therefore he knew nothing either of the enemys numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the	73.72437286376953
3819/28840	Very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery he might have purchased his life by speaking he doesnt wish to	85.93984985351562
3820/28840	The two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to Marshal de Grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had	49.66191864013672
3821/28840	When he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner	62.98656463623047
3822/28840	The soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him	471.7325134277344
3823/28840	One moment said the prisoner in	218.3073272705078
3824/28840	I am ready to speak my	24.11050033569336
3825/28840	Ah ah said the prince laughing I thought we should come to	73.80967712402344
3826/28840	I have a sure method of limbering	392.28765869140625
3827/28840	Young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in	87.34121704101562
3828/28840	But on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be	100.26547241210938
3829/28840	Where did the army cross the Lys   Between SaintVenant and A	349.2169494628906
3830/28840	By whom is it commanded   By Count de Fuonsaldagna General Beck and the archdu	141.031494140625
3831/28840	Of how many does it consist   Eighteen thousand men and thirtysix	181.7657470703125
3832/28840	And its aim is  	499.941162109375
3833/28840	You see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward Marshal de Grammont and the other	70.48676300048828
3834/28840	Yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human	57.05947494506836
3835/28840	Recall Le Plessis Bellievre Villequier and DErlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the	176.06883239746094
3836/28840	Let them hold themselves in readiness to march	448.411376953125
3837/28840	Tomorrow according to all probability we shall attack the	141.1683349609375
3838/28840	But my lord said Marshal de Grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand	72.17324829101562
3839/28840	Monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are	66.073974609375
3840/28840	Then turning toward the prisoner Take away that man he said and keep him carefully in	159.92442321777344
3841/28840	His life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be	103.00033569335938
3842/28840	Count de Guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with	38.550880432128906
3843/28840	Monsieur he continued addressing Raoul if you are not too tired follow	53.49924850463867
3844/28840	To the end of the world my lord cried Raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his	65.09467315673828
3845/28840	The prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated	358.25811767578125
3846/28840	Come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered tomorrow we shall know if you are good in	49.88921356201172
3847/28840	And I said the marshal what am I to do   Wait here to receive the	60.36344909667969
3848/28840	I shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to	129.18673706054688
3849/28840	Twenty guards well mounted are all that I shall need for my	175.23854064941406
3850/28840	That is very few said the marsh	80.60830688476562
3851/28840	Have you a good horse Monsieur de Bragelonne   My horse was killed this morning my lord and I am mounted provisionally on my lac	39.43450164794922
3852/28840	Choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like	138.8165283203125
3853/28840	No false modesty take the best horse you can	287.8521423339844
3854/28840	You will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it	162.0359344482422
3855/28840	Now monsieur he said to Raoul will you give me the letter you have brought   Raoul handed the letter to the	28.603130340576172
3856/28840	The prince read as he hastened	104.9436264038086
3857/28840	Monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of	41.01899719238281
3858/28840	I have only to say after the little that I have seen and heard that I think even better of you than I have been	43.036895751953125
3859/28840	Meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to Lens the noise of the cannon sounded	104.66512298583984
3860/28840	The prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of	77.49545288085938
3861/28840	One would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his	138.3019256591797
3862/28840	From time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a	81.55790710449219
3863/28840	At length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of Aun	66.50011444091797
3864/28840	The report of Spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was	209.4627227783203
3865/28840	The women had already fled taking refuge in Vitry only a few men	252.24595642089844
3866/28840	On seeing the prince they hastened to meet	42.80398178100586
3867/28840	Ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal Spaniards and those Lorraine robbers   Yes said the prince if you will serve me as	45.09303283691406
3868/28840	Where does your highness wish to go   To some elevated spot whence I can look down on Lens and the surrounding country   In that case Im your	96.59662628173828
3869/28840	I can trust youyou are a true Frenchman   I am an old soldier of Rocroy my	52.87017822265625
3870/28840	Here said the prince handing him a purse here is for Roc	151.2962646484375
3871/28840	Now do you want a horse or will you go afoot   Afoot my lord I have served always in the	77.90091705322266
3872/28840	Besides I expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to	143.70436096191406
3873/28840	Come then said the prince let us lose no	35.206119537353516
3874/28840	The peasant started off running before the princes horse then a hundred steps from the village he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the	117.71912384033203
3875/28840	For a half league they proceeded thus the cannonshot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the	179.3261260986328
3876/28840	At length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountains	174.37457275390625
3877/28840	The prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and Raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the	138.5207061767578
3878/28840	He then began to ascend the	120.39921569824219
3879/28840	In about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding	111.22774505615234
3880/28840	At a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on Lens at bay and before Lens the enemys entire	116.01271057128906
3881/28840	With a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from Lens as far as Vim	167.29058837890625
3882/28840	In a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save France the second time from invasion was unrolled in his	64.98625183105469
3883/28840	He took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote   My Dear MarshalIn an hour Lens will be in the enemys	84.83936309814453
3884/28840	Come and rejoin me bring with you the whole	94.16596221923828
3885/28840	I shall be at Vendin to place it in	114.12384796142578
3886/28840	Tomorrow we shall retake Lens and beat the	199.0845947265625
3887/28840	Then turning toward Raoul Go monsieur he said ride fast and give this letter to Monsieur de Gram	44.79383087158203

3889/28840	A quarter of an hour later he was with the marsh	30.777753829956055
3890/28840	A portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to	153.2403564453125
3891/28840	Marshal de Grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to Vendin leaving the Duc de Chatillon to await and bring on the	72.34900665283203
3892/28840	All the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moments	233.80064392089844
3893/28840	It was seven oclock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed	26.721309661865234
3894/28840	As he had foreseen Lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after Raouls	69.84335327148438
3895/28840	The event was announced by the cessation of the	125.72882843017578
3896/28840	As the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detach	350.2008056640625
3897/28840	Orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet	358.32373046875
3898/28840	At nine oclock the night had fully	75.42985534667969
3899/28840	Still a last ray of twilight lighted the	116.89579772949219
3900/28840	The army marched silently the prince at the head of the	152.8489227294922
3901/28840	Presently the army came in sight of Lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by	170.0539093017578
3902/28840	The prince assigned to every one his	185.3805389404297
3903/28840	Marshal de Grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on Meric	255.49549865722656
3904/28840	The Duc de Chatillon commanded the	90.51128387451172
3905/28840	Finally the prince led the right wing resting on Aun	221.755859375
3906/28840	The order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the	70.02752685546875
3907/28840	Each one on awaking would find himself on the field of	48.86907958984375
3908/28840	The movement was executed in silence and with	359.3015441894531
3909/28840	At ten oclock every one was in his appointed position at halfpast ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following	68.63275146484375
3910/28840	The prince assigned the Count de Guiche to his father and kept Bragelonne near his own person but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded	53.06178665161133
3911/28840	A tent was erected for them near that of the marsh	215.51060485839844
3912/28840	Although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to	123.26228332519531
3913/28840	And besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible	67.5738525390625
3914/28840	On the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become	177.99942016601562
3915/28840	It need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is	143.06564331054688
3916/28840	Some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to	52.13869857788086
3917/28840	The letters were longthe four pages were covered with closely written	778.4188232421875
3918/28840	The writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and	320.951904296875
3919/28840	The letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their	151.52830505371094
3920/28840	In case any evil should happen to me said Bragel	68.66600799560547
3921/28840	In case I should be killed said De Gu	37.658103942871094
3922/28840	They then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and	218.9596405029297
3923/28840	The second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the	92.41020965576172
3924/28840	The first rendezvous was fixed for the following Wednesday at eight oclock in the evening	60.73835754394531
3925/28840	On that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from his own abode or	94.24578094482422
3926/28840	The first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of	88.79501342773438
3927/28840	Athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of	547.0992431640625
3928/28840	At this order given in Athoss habitually calm manner the face of the Gascon relaxed and Porthoss brow grew	155.79730224609375
3929/28840	He knew that Athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to	51.127357482910156
3930/28840	This astonishment was doubled when Aramis saw Athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former	118.46614074707031
3931/28840	In a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their	155.8426971435547
3932/28840	Now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the	193.72634887695312
3933/28840	Soonstrange factAramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which Porthos unfastened his	272.82940673828125
3934/28840	Battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great	216.42591857910156
3935/28840	A great prince said Aramis with whom Mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with	91.19690704345703
3936/28840	The prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an illbred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent	97.9554443359375
3937/28840	In this list there were three conditions which displeased Mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce	98.8692855834961
3938/28840	What did Mazarin do   Stormed suggested Ath	128.8206787109375
3939/28840	You have guessed it answered Aramis and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything he thought they were	148.02890014648438
3940/28840	At last their hilarity calmed down and   Faith exclaimed DArtagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to Mazarin for I assure you on his side he wishes you no	80.15666961669922
3941/28840	If I thought the fellow knew me by my name I would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought I knew	90.23436737060547
3942/28840	He knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them I can answer for	50.978736877441406
3943/28840	By whom   By me and this morning he sent for me to ask me if I had obtained any	42.49595642089844
3944/28840	And what did you reply   That I had none as yet but that I was to dine today with two gentlemen who would be able to give me	43.054046630859375
3945/28840	You told him that said Porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest	88.36537170410156
3946/28840	Bravo and you are not afraid of that Athos   No replied Athos it is not the search of Mazarin that I	33.647186279296875
3947/28840	Now said Aramis tell me a little what you do	68.1722640991211
3948/28840	Nothing for the present at least nothing in good	198.0265655517578
3949/28840	And with regard to the past asked Porth	31.969480514526367
3950/28840	Oh the past is another thing said Athos sighing the past and the	68.71454620361328
3951/28840	Are you afraid for your young Raoul asked Aram	92.82694244384766
3952/28840	Well said DArtagnan one is never killed in a first	44.31327819824219
3953/28840	Well I shall look upon it as an exp	53.1741828918457
3954/28840	Ah said DArtagnan I know what you	9.9796781539917
3955/28840	And I too added Aramis but you must not think of that Athos what is past is	76.90880584716797
3956/28840	The affair at Armentieres asked he	111.93106079101562
3957/28840	Oh yes said Porthos true I had forgotten it   Athos looked at him int	24.468639373779297
3958/28840	You have forgotten it Porthos said	40.441200256347656
3959/28840	Faith yes it is so long ago answered Porth	31.508806228637695
3960/28840	This affair does not then weigh upon your conscience   Faith	106.51521301269531
3961/28840	And you DArtagnan   II own that when my mind returns to that terrible period I have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor Madame Bonancie	109.7722396850586
3962/28840	Yes yes murmured he I have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the	125.29402923583984
3963/28840	Consider said Aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of	74.49293518066406
3964/28840	We were but the instruments that is	168.21728515625
3965/28840	But as to free will Aramis   How acts the judge He has a free will yet he fearlessly	168.74728393554688
3966/28840	What does the executioner He is master of his arm yet he strikes without	191.0605926513672
3967/28840	The executioner muttered Athos as if arrested by some	188.0195770263672
3968/28840	As for me said Porthos now that you have reminded me of it Athos I have the scene again before me as if I now were	55.639892578125
3969/28840	Milady was there as it were where you	320.92742919921875
3970/28840	I wore a long sword which cut like a Damascusyou remember it Aramis for you always called it Balizard	165.310302734375
3971/28840	Upon my honor and by the holy cross I only regret it because she was a	111.2994155883789
3972/28840	The most satisfactory part of the matter said DArtagnan is that there remains no trace of	34.960506439208984
3973/28840	Then said Athos woe to De Winter for the child had done no	63.183475494384766
3974/28840	May the devil take me if the child be not dead said Porth	62.06178665161133
3975/28840	There is so much fog in that detestable country at least so DArtagnan	51.01287841796875
3976/28840	Just as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the	103.3384017944336
3977/28840	Please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of	69.34365844726562
3978/28840	To which of us asked all the four	107.63390350341797
3979/28840	To him who is called the Comte de la F	8.832364082336426
3980/28840	It is I said Athos and what is the name of the person   Grim	19.69900131225586
3981/28840	Back already What can have happened then to Bragelonne   Let him enter cried DArtagnan let him come	32.373207092285156
3982/28840	But Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave	62.02850341796875
3983/28840	The door being closed the four friends waited in	260.1143798828125
3984/28840	Grimauds agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible	187.6719512939453
3985/28840	Your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself he is ready to spring upon youbeware   Athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy	98.92625427246094
3986/28840	Porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall Aramis seized his knife DArtagnan	38.59685516357422
3987/28840	What do you mean Grimaud he	63.18965148925781
3988/28840	That Miladys son has left England that he is in France on his road to Paris if he be not here	218.5535430908203
3989/28840	Are you sure of it   Certain replied Grim	39.42412567138672
3990/28840	Grimaud was so breathless so exhausted that he had fallen back upon a	134.8495330810547
3991/28840	Athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to	251.63552856445312
3992/28840	Well after all said DArtagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to Paris we have seen many other	62.362648010253906
3993/28840	Yes echoed Porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him	74.95985412597656
3994/28840	Moreover he is but a child said Aram	34.72985076904297
3995/28840	Do you know what he has done this child Disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of Bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his	69.34098052978516
3996/28840	See it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the	113.14683532714844
3997/28840	And Grimaud threw the dagger on the	65.76132202148438
3998/28840	DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their	27.73602867126465
3999/28840	Athos alone remained seated calm and	1214.1585693359375
4000/28840	And you say he is dressed as a monk Grimaud   Yes as an Augustine	87.4070816040039
4001/28840	What sized man is he   About my height thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen	285.2781982421875
4002/28840	And he did not see Raoul asked Ath	21.83842658996582
4003/28840	Yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying	41.357730865478516
4004/28840	Athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his	227.5453643798828
4005/28840	And very soon they left the	174.3485565185547

4137/28840	But this relation you mentioneddo you wish me to speak to him said Mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about Cromwells	50.18014144897461

4144/28840	Observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying   Send on your business those who do theirs at the same time Let us see what this letter	71.63146209716797
4145/28840	We here present the letter verbatim   To his Eminence Monseigneur le Cardinal Mazarini   I have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in	75.17877960205078
4146/28840	The two kingdoms are so near that France must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of	117.43414306640625
4147/28840	The English are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of Charles and his	226.6949920654297
4148/28840	Placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement I can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable	160.08494567871094
4149/28840	I am at present in the midst of war and am about to deliver a decisive battle against King	68.41842651367188
4150/28840	I shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the Spirit of the Lord are with	85.46563720703125
4151/28840	This battle won by me the king will have no further resources in England or in Scotland and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into France to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and	144.4212646484375
4152/28840	France has already received Queen Henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my	159.63504028320312
4153/28840	But Madame Henrietta is a daughter of France and was entitled to the hospitality of	53.367042541503906
4154/28840	As to King Charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him France will censure the acts of the English nation and thus so essentially harm England and especially the wellbeing of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced	187.54714965820312
4155/28840	At this moment Mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young	85.42228698730469
4156/28840	Mazarin resumed his reading   It is important therefore monseigneur that I should be informed as to the intentions of	98.72748565673828
4157/28840	The interests of that kingdom and those of England though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the	252.11944580078125

4160/28840	I have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the French kingdom and leave to her own the new government of	71.18364715576172
4161/28840	That neutrality consists simply in excluding King Charles from the territory of France and in refraining from helping hima stranger to your countrywith arms with money or with	286.38885498046875
4162/28840	My letter is private and confidential and for that reason I send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsel	105.07136535644531

4185/28840	I am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like	100.33443450927734

4205/28840	Oh madame said Mazarin your majesty knows not what you	35.266143798828125
4206/28840	On the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own	86.03669738769531
4207/28840	To the point sir said the queen to the point and answer me yes or no if the king persists in remaining in England will you send him succor If he comes to France will you accord him hospitality What do you intend to do	115.01168823242188
4208/28840	Madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech I shall convince your majesty I trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at	78.61585998535156
4209/28840	After which your majesty will I think no longer doubt my zeal in your	85.64832305908203
4210/28840	The queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her	109.81999206542969
4211/28840	Well what do you propose to do she said at length come	109.0715103149414
4212/28840	I will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to	110.28093719482422
4213/28840	With which you are at waris it not so You will charge Broussel to report	117.1648941040039

4217/28840	It signifies little said Mazarin when he was	96.52566528320312
4218/28840	It gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but I have said nothing either to the one or to the	74.7896957397461
4219/28840	See if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the	71.43802642822266
4220/28840	Bernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges who was on	67.73973846435547
4221/28840	Your eminence said Comminges as I was reconducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by Raphael which is opposite the	81.13294982910156
4222/28840	He reflected for a second and then descended the	127.49313354492188
4223/28840	I believe I saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace	152.70248413085938
4224/28840	But is not your eminence going to the queen   For what purpose   Monsieur de Guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the	27.232624053955078
4225/28840	Comminges had seen rightly and Mordaunt had really acted as he had	182.094970703125
4226/28840	In crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived De Winter who was waiting until the queen had finished her	140.4970703125
4227/28840	At this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of Raphaels picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible	138.47665405273438
4228/28840	His eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his	92.96630096435547
4229/28840	He had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with Mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to	49.75074005126953
4230/28840	At last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and De Winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her	79.8755874633789
4231/28840	The horses started on a trot and took the road to the Louvre which they	47.704559326171875

4233/28840	How sometimes the Unhappy mistake Chance for	850.66015625
4234/28840	Well madame said De Winter when the queen had dismissed her	37.15534973144531
4235/28840	Well my lord what I foresaw has come to	75.75302124023438
4236/28840	What does the cardinal refuse to receive the king France refuse hospitality to an unfortunate prince Ay but it is for the first time madame   I did not say France my lord I said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a	65.68936157226562
4237/28840	But did you see the queen   It is useless replied Henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says	50.05436706542969
4238/28840	Are you not aware that this Italian directs everything both indoors and out And moreover I should not be surprised had we been forestalled by Crom	82.20851135253906
4239/28840	He was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to	198.35061645507812
4240/28840	Then did you not observe the agitation in the Palais Royal the passing to and fro of busy people Can they have received any news my lord   Not from England mad	68.30974578857422
4241/28840	I made such haste that I am certain of not having been forest	38.920379638671875
4242/28840	I set out three days ago passing miraculously through the Puritan army and I took post horses with my servant Tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in	107.6199951171875
4243/28840	Besides the king I am certain awaits your majestys reply before risking	91.9212875366211
4244/28840	I shall go and die by his	47.5775032043457
4245/28840	Madame madame exclaimed De Winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some	171.5594482421875
4246/28840	What can be done with four   Four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom I speak performed great things at one	139.77252197265625
4247/28840	And where are these four men   Ah that is what I do not	19.41572380065918
4248/28840	It is twenty years since I saw them and yet whenever I have seen the king in danger I have thought of	47.572181701660156
4249/28840	And these men were your friends   One of them held my life in his hands and gave it to	41.055912017822266
4250/28840	I know not whether he is still my friend but since that time I have remained	67.60346984863281
4251/28840	And these men are in France my lord   I believe	33.01984405517578
4252/28840	Tell me their names perhaps I may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding	121.03227996826172
4253/28840	One of them was called the Chevalier dArtagn	14.00637149810791
4254/28840	Ah my lord if I mistake not the Chevalier dArtagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for I fear that this man is entirely devoted to the	33.72124099731445
4255/28840	That would be a misfortune said De Winter and I shall begin to think that we are really	41.70794677734375
4256/28840	But the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his	86.94268035888672
4257/28840	The others my lord   The secondI heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the Comte de la F	78.12266540527344
4258/28840	As for the two others I had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that I have forgotten their real	89.61412811279297
4259/28840	Oh mon Dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the	45.18919372558594
4260/28840	Oh yes said De Winter for they are the same	56.07301712036133
4261/28840	Have you never heard that Queen Anne of Austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen   Yes at the time of her relations with Monsieur de Buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and	93.7120590209961
4262/28840	Well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men dofor I tell you you must not count on Monsieur dArtagn	49.46236801147461
4263/28840	Seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to England I will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave White	164.35964965820312
4264/28840	Seek them my lord and find them I conjure	170.68765258789062
4265/28840	I will search for them madame said De Winter and doubtless I shall find them but time fails	77.88417053222656
4266/28840	Has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony   Then indeed we are lost cried the queen in the fullness of a broken	85.0643081665039
4267/28840	At this moment the door opened and the young Henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to De Winter to change the	53.555545806884766
4268/28840	But that act of selfcontrol effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young	36.716400146484375
4269/28840	She stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen   Why then do you always weep mother when I am away from you she	90.74343872070312
4270/28840	The queen smiled but instead of answering   See De Winter she said I have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of mad	110.62892150878906
4271/28840	Then turning toward her daughter   What do you want Henrietta she	44.71101760864258
4272/28840	I saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the Viscount de Bragel	26.628021240234375
4273/28840	The queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and Raoul appeared on the	36.694583892822266
4274/28840	Advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt	54.840518951416016
4275/28840	Madame said he I bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the Count de Guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his	41.33447265625
4276/28840	At the name of the Count de Guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of	34.30882263183594
4277/28840	You told me that the letter was from the Marechal de Grammont Henrietta said the	18.015350341796875
4278/28840	I thought so madame stammered the young	35.95404052734375
4279/28840	It is my fault madame said Ra	23.646224975585938
4280/28840	I did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the Marechal de Grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the Count de Guiche acted as his	50.47670364379883
4281/28840	There has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to Raoul to	61.989383697509766
4282/28840	At this announcement of a battle having taken place the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her	151.74110412597656
4283/28840	No madame replied Raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of	32.50918197631836
4284/28840	The young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their	120.98582458496094
4285/28840	Let us see said the queen what the count	71.45441436767578
4286/28840	If her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of	75.64170837402344
4287/28840	I have the honor to be with respect	55.316070556640625
4288/28840	The battle of Lens gained said the queen they are lucky here indeed they can gain battles Yes the Marechal de Grammont is right this will change the aspect of French affairs but I much fear it will do nothing for English even if it does not harm	121.31719207763672
4289/28840	This is recent news sir continued she and I thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter I should not have heard till tomorrow perhaps after tomorrowthe last of all	79.42522430419922
4290/28840	Madame said Raoul the Louvre is but the second palace this news has reached it is as yet unknown to all and I had sworn to the Count de Guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even I should embrace my	75.72511291503906
4291/28840	Your guardian is he too a Bragelonne asked Lord de	70.72533416748047

4293/28840	And your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name   The Comte de la Fere madame replied the young man b	22.788570404052734
4294/28840	De Winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of	30.205408096313477
4295/28840	The Comte de la Fere she	11.729283332824707
4296/28840	Have you not mentioned that name to me   As for De Winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard ar	31.900211334228516
4297/28840	The Comte de la Fere he cried in his	11.117932319641113

4300/28840	Latterly I heard his friend Monsieur dArtagnan give him that	47.806983947753906
4301/28840	That is it madame that is the	43.23883056640625
4302/28840	God be praised And he is in Paris continued he addressing Raoul then turning to the queen We may still	112.75338745117188
4303/28840	Providence has declared for us since I have found this brave man again in so miraculous a	240.3249053955078
4304/28840	And sir where does he reside pray   The Comte de la Fere lodges in the Rue Guenegaud Hotel du Grand Roi Charlem	20.172794342041016
4305/28840	Inform this dear friend that he may remain within that I shall go and see him	153.92877197265625
4306/28840	Sir I obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to	90.1851577758789
4307/28840	Go Monsieur de Bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our	19.08420181274414
4308/28840	Raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to De Winter	163.81983947753906
4309/28840	The queen and De Winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own	96.88312530517578
4310/28840	Then when De Winter rose to take leave   Listen my lord said the queen I have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of	63.24062728881836
4311/28840	They are worth about fifty thousand	79.70764923095703
4312/28840	I had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be	132.94219970703125
4313/28840	Take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my	214.8782196044922
4314/28840	Madame replied De Winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to	39.61127853393555
4315/28840	I hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place nor should I accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us but our estates are confiscated our ready money is exhausted and we are reduced to turn to service everything we	182.14674377441406
4316/28840	In an hour hence I shall be with the Comte de la Fere and tomorrow your majesty shall have a definite	34.28749465942383
4317/28840	The horse and servant belonging to De Winter were waiting for him at the door he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the Lou	88.74502563476562
4318/28840	It was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little	60.13803482055664
4319/28840	In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have observed a similar	70.65478515625
4320/28840	Tony he said motioning to his groom to	65.74034118652344
4321/28840	Did you remark that man who is following us   Yes my	41.15461730957031
4322/28840	Who is he   I do not know only he has followed your grace from the Palais Royal stopped at the Louvre to wait for you and now leaves the Louvre with	44.92044448852539
4323/28840	Some spy of the cardinal said De Winter to him	85.75727081298828
4324/28840	Let us pretend not to notice that he is watching	148.95211791992188
4325/28840	And spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the Marais for having for so long a time lived near the Place Royale Lord de Winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient	150.7303466796875
4326/28840	The unknown spurred his horse to a gall	183.5235137939453
4327/28840	De Winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the	55.06941604614258
4328/28840	He turned around and Mordaunt stood before	51.27638626098633
4329/28840	There was a moment of frozen silence between these	137.6842498779297
4330/28840	Sir said De Winter I thought I had already made you aware that I am weary of this persecution withdraw then or I shall call and have you turned out as you were in	79.69522094726562
4331/28840	I am not your uncle I know you	53.340492248535156
4332/28840	My uncle replied Mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in Londonyou dare	101.49217987060547
4333/28840	As for denying that I am your nephew you will think twice about it now that I have learned some things of which I was ignorant a year	75.76361083984375
4334/28840	And how does it concern me what you have learned said De	47.41145324707031
4335/28840	Oh it concerns you very closely my uncle I am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus	65.27455139160156
4336/28840	Yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with Lord de Winter and crossing his	38.690731048583984
4337/28840	I have asked the headsman of Bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and	56.58320617675781
4338/28840	And the headsman of Bethune gave me a	42.87567138671875
4339/28840	De Winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a	77.0090560913086
4340/28840	Yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key I open the	124.32657623291016

4346/28840	De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young	98.54146575927734
4347/28840	You desire to fathom this horrible secret said De Winter well then so be	112.62764739990234
4348/28840	Know then what manner of woman it was for whom today you call me to	98.08748626708984
4349/28840	That woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my	70.07600402832031
4350/28840	What say you to that   I say that she was my	43.998260498046875
4351/28840	She caused the unfortunate Duke of Buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was ere that honest good and	123.53300476074219
4352/28840	What say you to that crime of which I have the proof   She was my	88.48558044433594
4353/28840	On our return to France she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the Augustines at Beth	62.815059661865234
4354/28840	Will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishmentfor of all this I have the proofs   She was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing	75.17454528808594
4355/28840	Depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by Heaven and	179.78025817871094

4358/28840	The latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death   Would you assassinate me sir Then I shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a	60.32762145996094
4359/28840	No replied Mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm no I shall not kill you at least not at this moment for without you I could not discover the	85.76185607910156
4360/28840	But when I have found them then tremble	92.74495697021484
4361/28840	I stabbed to the heart the headsman of Bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you	99.9881362915039
4362/28840	With these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed Tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his	128.7335968017578
4363/28840	But De Winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying   My God I thank Thee that he knows me	83.93080139160156
4364/28840	Listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of Athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious	119.59750366210938
4365/28840	He forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the	95.81665802001953
4366/28840	It almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to	254.44725036621094
4367/28840	Athos was happyhappy as he had never been	142.98004150390625
4368/28840	And you assisted and took part in this great battle Bragelonne cried the former musket	83.21040344238281
4369/28840	And it was a fierce one   His highness the prince charged eleven times in	149.98934936523438
4370/28840	I did not lose sight of him for an	12.774494171142578
4371/28840	Oh how fine it is to be called Condé and to be so worthy of such a name   He was calm and radiant was he not   As calm as at parade radiant as at a fet	71.50509643554688
4372/28840	When we went up to the enemy it was slowly we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the Spaniards who were on a height with lowered musk	93.87584686279297
4373/28840	When we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers Comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge but after that you will make short work with those	123.00281524658203
4374/28840	There was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words then raising his sword Sound trumpets he	128.38221740722656
4375/28840	Well very good you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you Raoul   I know not sir but I thought it really very fine and grand   Were you afraid Raoul asked the	47.11583709716797
4376/28840	Yes sir replied the young man naively I felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in Spanish from the enemys ranks I closed my eyes and thought of	70.59857940673828
4377/28840	In honest truth Raoul said Athos pressing his	47.3408203125
4378/28840	Yes sir at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had	77.14534759521484
4379/28840	Those who were not killed felt the heat of the	128.21307373046875
4380/28840	I opened my eyes astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt a third of the squadron were lying on the ground wounded dead or	171.61444091796875
4381/28840	At that moment I encountered the eye of the	80.01602172851562
4382/28840	I had but one thought and that was that he was observing	74.09803009033203
4383/28840	I spurred on and found myself in the enemys	62.76005935668945
4384/28840	And the prince was pleased with you   He told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to Paris with Monsieur de Chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had	40.372520446777344
4385/28840	Go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time I have no need of your	66.63603210449219
4386/28840	Go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister De Longueville that I thank her for the present that she made me of	78.21200561523438
4387/28840	And I came sir added Raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for I thought you would be glad to see me	35.93401336669922
4388/28840	Athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young	55.752098083496094
4389/28840	What is his name   I did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although I thought from his accent he was an English	39.39820861816406
4390/28840	Ah said Athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could	37.902984619140625
4391/28840	Then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate	32.73229217529297
4392/28840	Yes truly dear friend and I may even say the sight of you increases my	114.83627319335938
4393/28840	And De Winter glancing around him Raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffected	57.51442337036133
4394/28840	Come now that we are alone said Athos let us talk of	27.286216735839844
4395/28840	Whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied De	102.77098083496094
4396/28840	Does Grimaud know him then   No but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew	33.82756423950195
4397/28840	The headsman of Bethune exclaimed De	51.644805908203125
4398/28840	You know about that cried Athos	138.56410217285156
4399/28840	He has just left me replied De Winter after telling me	50.58290100097656
4400/28840	De Winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his	51.87456130981445
4401/28840	Do you not know the race said	109.57215881347656
4402/28840	Pooh said Athos trying to smile in his	30.71228790283203
4403/28840	It must have lost its ferocity in the second	74.14744567871094
4404/28840	Besides my friend Providence has warned us that we may be on our	85.45984649658203
4405/28840	All we can now do is to	99.97001647949219
4406/28840	Let us wait and as I said before let us speak of	90.21707153320312
4407/28840	What brings you to Paris   Affairs of importance which you shall know	135.4844512939453
4408/28840	But what is this that I hear from Her Majesty the Queen of England Monsieur dArtagnan sides with Mazarin Pardon my frankness dear	45.92613983154297
4409/28840	I neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred by	192.8340301513672
4410/28840	But do you happen to belong to him   Monsieur dArtagnan replied Athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional	34.012657165527344
4411/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to	34.445926666259766
4412/28840	Millionaires like yourself my lord are rare in	1072.5380859375
4413/28840	Alas said De Winter I am at this moment as poor as he is if not	42.76945114135742
4414/28840	Well then you wish to know if I am of Mazarins party	56.8970832824707
4415/28840	I am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence You make me young and happy again by	105.63813018798828
4416/28840	Ah so you are not a Mazarinist Delightful Indeed you could not belong to	109.66268920898438
4417/28840	But pardon me are you free I mean to ask if you are married   Ah as to that no replied Athos	56.848106384277344
4418/28840	Because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished   Is a child I have adopted and who does not even know who was his	77.66517639160156
4419/28840	Very well you are always the same Athos great and	204.37564086914062
4420/28840	Are you still friends with Monsieur Porthos and Monsieur Aramis   Add Monsieur dArtagnan my	11.612303733825684
4421/28840	We still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being Mazarinists or Frondists then we are only	81.69670867919922
4422/28840	Is Monsieur Aramis with DArtagnan asked Lord de	14.508490562438965
4423/28840	No said Athos Monsieur Aramis does me the honor to share my	39.65961456298828
4424/28840	Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend Is he much changed   He has become an abbé that is	56.57632827758789
4425/28840	You alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undert	176.3915252685547
4426/28840	On the contrary said Athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him a veritable	31.118471145629883
4427/28840	Could you engage to bring him to me tomorrow morning at ten oclock on the Pont du Louvre   Oh oh exclaimed Athos smiling you have a duel in	32.6013069152832
4428/28840	Yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which I hope you will take your	79.97711944580078
4429/28840	Where are we to go my lord   To Her Majesty the Queen of England who has desired me to present you to	38.5097541809082
4430/28840	This is an enigma said Athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it I ask no	57.205631256103516
4431/28840	Will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me   Thanks count no replied De	42.4307975769043
4432/28840	I own to you that that young mans visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my	177.49005126953125
4433/28840	What undertaking can have brought him to Paris It was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my	71.28704071044922
4434/28840	This young man terrifies me my lord there lies in him a sanguinary predis	84.60356140136719
4435/28840	What occupies him in England   He is one of Cromwells most enthusiastic	105.35948944091797
4436/28840	But what attached him to the cause His father and mother were Catholics I believe   His hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of De	80.01911926269531
4437/28840	And what name does he now bear   Mord	99.84710693359375
4438/28840	A Puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in	226.5227508544922
4439/28840	Do you say as a monk   It was thus and by mere accidentmay God pardon me if I blasphemethat he heard the confession of the executioner of Beth	59.20873260498047
4440/28840	Then I understand it all he has been sent by Cromwell to Mazarin and the queen guessed rightly we have been forest	51.96571731567383
4441/28840	But the night is dark said Athos perceiving that Lord de Winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear and you have no	54.428436279296875
4442/28840	I have Tony a safe if simple	557.7621459960938
4443/28840	Halloo there Grimaud Olivain and Blaisois call the viscount and take the musket with	76.1956558227539
4444/28840	Blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the Chateau de Bragelonne whom Athos had christened by the name of his	63.725563049316406
4445/28840	Viscount said Athos to Raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach	54.33684539794922
4446/28840	Oh count said De Winter for whom do you take me   For a stranger who does not know Paris said Athos and to whom the viscount will show the	40.835323333740234
4447/28840	De Winter shook him by the	61.8151741027832
4448/28840	Grimaud said Athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the	67.16824340820312
4449/28840	Grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloqu	151.3203582763672
4450/28840	The same order was followed in returning nor did Grimauds searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud and of the Qu	88.49629974365234
4451/28840	He fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his	92.27156066894531
4452/28840	He pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which Grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue	143.880859375
4453/28840	The next day on awaking the count perceived Raoul by his bed	75.80723571777344
4454/28840	The young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by	103.66654968261719
4455/28840	Yes sir replied Raoul with slight hesitation I did not sleep	44.33226776123047
4456/28840	You Raoul not sleep well then you must have something on your mind said Ath	59.439727783203125
4457/28840	Where then said Athos smiling if it be not a	29.456323623657227
4458/28840	You are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting	105.59033966064453
4459/28840	Never sir said Raoul as long as I possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall I deem I have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to	94.72578430175781
4460/28840	I have however a wish to go and pass a day at Bl	68.0957260131836
4461/28840	You look at me and you are going to laugh at	36.60503005981445
4462/28840	No on the contrary I am not inclined to laugh said Athos suppressing a	31.22309684753418
4463/28840	You wish to see Blois again it is but	64.6785659790039
4464/28840	Then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed Raoul joy	74.8749008178711
4465/28840	Certainly and why should I regret what gives you pleasure   Oh how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardians hand and I can set out immediately   When you like Ra	53.985084533691406
4466/28840	Sir said Raoul as he turned to leave the room I have thought of one thing and that is about the Duchess of Chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom I owe my introduction to the	35.4234733581543
4467/28840	And you ought to thank her Ra	95.02106475830078
4468/28840	Well try the Hotel de Luynes Raoul and ask if the duchess can receive	70.258544921875
4469/28840	I am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the	40.21077346801758
4470/28840	Raoul went out and when Athos heard his young joyous voice calling to Grimaud and Olivain he	112.34300231933594
4471/28840	It is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common	120.73963165283203
4472/28840	Nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not	562.3565673828125
4473/28840	Everything was ready at ten oclock for the departure and as Athos was watching Raoul mount a groom rode up from the Duchess de Chevre	43.19391632080078
4474/28840	He was charged to tell the Comte de la Fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her	39.55704879760742
4475/28840	Tell her grace replied Athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Lu	50.21190643310547
4476/28840	Then with renewed instructions to Grimaud Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that	66.78958892822266
4477/28840	Athos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had given his letter to Blaisois the only servingman whom he had	74.42166900634766
4478/28840	Blaisois found Bazin donning his beadles gown his services being required that day at Notre	228.2552947998047
4479/28840	Athos had desired Blaisois to try to speak to Aramis	99.88853454589844
4480/28840	Blaisois seeing Bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and Christian	111.35128021240234
4481/28840	From the Comte de la Fere said Aram	4.898670673370361
4482/28840	And he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much	77.61116790771484
4483/28840	Blaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of the Grand Roi Charlemagne and when Athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his	82.90802001953125
4484/28840	And you did not tell him that you came from me   No	22.139196395874023
4485/28840	At ten oclock Athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the Pont du Louvre and was almost immediately joined by Lord de	38.33359909057617
4486/28840	They waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear Aramis was not coming to join	80.7295150756836
4487/28840	Patience said Athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the Rue du Bac patience I see an abbé cuffing a man then bowing to a woman it must be Aram	38.00602722167969
4488/28840	Having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him Aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten p	96.62877655029297
4489/28840	At this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty Aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious	59.19221496582031
4490/28840	A most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and Lord de	90.75083923339844
4491/28840	Where are we going inquired Aramis are we going to fight perchance I carry no sword this morning and cannot return home to procure	98.28178405761719
4492/28840	No said Lord de Winter we are going to pay a visit to Her Majesty the Queen of	25.351869583129883
4493/28840	Oh very well replied Aramis then bending his face down to Athoss ear what is the object of this visit continued	74.32088470458984
4494/28840	Nay I know not some evidence required from us	369.3401184082031
4495/28840	May it not be about that cursed affair asked Aramis in which case I do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others I am rather averse to receiving them	115.31304931640625
4496/28840	If it were so answered Athos we should not be taken there by Lord de Winter for he would come in for his share he was one of	52.529991149902344
4497/28840	On arriving at the Louvre Lord de Winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the	80.77815246582031
4498/28840	It was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by Athos Aramis and even the English	89.7909927368164
4499/28840	Mazarin is almost king answered Athos Madame Henrietta is almost no longer	324.47576904296875
4500/28840	If you would condescend to be clever Athos observed Aramis I really do think you would be wittier than poor Monsieur de Vo	74.8465576171875
4501/28840	The queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of Mis	82.56990814208984
4502/28840	The gentlemen entered and remained standing but at a motion from the queen they seated	148.49761962890625
4503/28840	Athos was calm and grave but Aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented	157.5803680419922
4504/28840	You are examining the luxury I enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around	108.57626342773438
4505/28840	Madame replied Aramis I must ask your pardon but I know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of Henry	47.56847381591797
4506/28840	is treated at the court of	66.25199890136719
4507/28840	Monsieur Aramis is not an officer asked the queen of Lord de	27.25201988220215
4508/28840	That gentleman is the Abbé dHerblay replied	19.141984939575195
4509/28840	Madame he said I am an abbé it is true but I am so against my	33.123592376708984
4510/28840	I never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and I am always ready to become a musketeer once	61.274925231933594
4511/28840	This morning being ignorant that I should have the honor of seeing your majesty I encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majestys service in whatever way you may see fit to use	71.1912841796875
4512/28840	The Abbé dHerblay resumed De Winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to His Majesty King Louis	36.495391845703125
4513/28840	of whom I have spoken to you mad	24.75475311279297
4514/28840	Then turning to Athos he continued And this gentleman is that noble Comte de la Fere whose high reputation is so well known to your	30.013172149658203
4515/28840	Gentlemen said the queen a few years ago I had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my	232.3308868408203
4516/28840	It is enough said Athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours mad	138.92453002929688
4517/28840	I am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of	118.77888488769531
4518/28840	Hold gentlemen here is the letter conveyed to me by Lord de	64.09858703613281
4519/28840	Obeying the queen Athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which King Charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of France would be accorded	94.44395446777344
4520/28840	Well asked Athos when he had closed the	33.93079376220703
4521/28840	Well said the queen it has been	52.8424072265625
4522/28840	The two friends exchanged a smile of	151.1330108642578
4523/28840	And now said Athos what is to be done I have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire Monsieur dHerblay and myself to do in your	26.66818618774414
4524/28840	Ah sir you have a noble heart exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude whilst Lord de Winter turned to her with a glance which said Did I not answer for them   But you sir said the queen to Aram	43.38444900512695
4525/28840	Well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for	58.16936111450195
4526/28840	The king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the Scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a Scotch	164.91624450683594
4527/28840	Since Lord de Winter left him I am distracted sir	86.57585144042969
4528/28840	I ask much too much perhaps for I have no title to request	94.30111694335938
4529/28840	Go to England join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his side and be near him in his house where conspiracies more dangerous than the perils of war are hatching every	213.6472930908203
4530/28840	And in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen I promisenot to reward you I believe that word would offend youbut to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every	128.07838439941406
4531/28840	And the queen raised her eyes solemnly	71.16497802734375
4532/28840	Madame said Athos when must we set out   You consent then exclaimed the queen joy	64.93114471435547
4533/28840	Yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our	122.99313354492188
4534/28840	We render service to God madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so	209.56283569335938
4535/28840	Madame we are yours body and	358.49908447265625
4536/28840	Oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years I have felt the least approach to joy or	98.04109954833984
4537/28840	Have you anything to ask of me From this moment I become your friend and since you are engaged in my affairs I ought to occupy myself in	70.74968719482422
4538/28840	Madame replied Athos I have only to ask your majestys	21.517597198486328
4539/28840	And I said Aramis I am alone in the world and have only your majesty to	36.742164611816406
4540/28840	The queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in a low tone to De Winter   If you need money my lord separate the jewels I have given you detach the diamonds and sell them to some	95.97944641113281
4541/28840	You will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like	107.43731689453125
4542/28840	The queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the Princess Henri	336.8492431640625
4543/28840	She gave the first to Athos and the other to Aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king after which they	76.14241027832031
4544/28840	At the foot of the staircase De Winter	88.18441009521484
4545/28840	Not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and I will go mine and this evening at nine oclock we will assemble again at the Gate Saint	76.05155181884766
4546/28840	We will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the	88.2305908203125
4547/28840	Once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the	78.66243743896484
4548/28840	The three gentlemen then shook hands Lord de Winter taking the Rue Saint Honore and Athos and Aramis remaining	67.9168472290039
4549/28840	Well said Aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count   Bad replied Athos very	34.33915328979492
4550/28840	As I shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear DHerbl	36.00697326660156
4551/28840	Monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy cannot survive without the countenance of monarch	126.24608612060547
4552/28840	Let us then support monarchy in order to support	279.0328674316406
4553/28840	We shall be murdered there said Aram	50.052947998046875
4554/28840	I hate the Englishthey are coarse like every nation that swills	539.4256591796875
4555/28840	Would it be better to remain here said Athos and take a turn in the Bastile or the dungeon of Vincennes for having favored the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort Ifaith Aramis believe me there is little left to	44.9849739074707
4556/28840	We avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is	466.8602600097656
4557/28840	And you   As for me I am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers I shall not find ten louis at	64.63636016845703
4558/28840	Lord de Winter is ruined for the moment Oliver Cromwell has annexed his income	128.21533203125
4559/28840	Now is the time when Baron Porthos would be	47.66475296020508
4560/28840	Now it is that I regret DArtagn	15.538617134094238
4561/28840	This secret Aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into our	118.59456634521484
4562/28840	And moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of	238.65261840820312
4563/28840	Let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of	200.0543670654297
4564/28840	You are right but what are you going to do until this evening I have two things to	35.725860595703125
4565/28840	And what are they   First a thrust with the coadjutor whom I met last night at Madame de Rambouillets and whom I found particular in his remarks respecting	87.1884994506836
4566/28840	This kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our	200.79226684570312
4567/28840	I am convinced that if I gave him a box on the ear such as I gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of	86.82331848144531
4568/28840	And I my dear Aramis quietly replied Athos I think it would only change Monsieur de Retzs	35.14875411987305
4569/28840	Take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the Fronde and you to the queen of	106.14680480957031
4570/28840	So if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first   Oh that is of the first	77.08937072753906
4571/28840	Unfortunately it is a thing that I cant perform at any time I	71.29469299316406
4572/28840	It was arranged for the evening and no other time will	113.33106994628906
4573/28840	But my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return   Yes if I	73.34040069580078
4574/28840	If you do not return how does it concern you Be	83.95870208740234
4575/28840	Come you are no longer twenty years	47.78606033325195
4576/28840	To my great regret mordieu Ah if I were but twenty years old   Yes said Athos doubtless you would commit great follies But now we must	85.86345672607422
4577/28840	I have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to	111.87535095214844
4578/28840	Call for me at eight oclock or shall I wait supper for you at seven   That will do very well said Aram	48.74280548095703
4579/28840	I have twenty visits to make and as many letters to	128.22291564941406
4580/28840	Athos went to pay a visit to Madame de Vendome left his name at Madame de Chevreuses and wrote the following letter to DArtagnan   Dear FriendI am about to set off with Aramis on important	45.353363037109375
4581/28840	I wished to make my adieux to you but time does not	111.95262145996094

4583/28840	At the hour agreed upon Aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to	60.0340576171875
4584/28840	Bythebye he said I think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for Porthos and DArtagn	50.354434967041016
4585/28840	The thing is done dear friend said Athos I foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and	70.82124328613281
4586/28840	You are a wonderful man my dear count said Aramis you think of	32.68086624145508
4587/28840	Well have you made up your mind to this journey   Quite and now that I reflect about it I am glad to leave Paris at this	62.934837341308594
4588/28840	And so am I replied Athos my only regret is not having seen DArtagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our	56.28034973144531
4589/28840	Sir said he here is Monsieur dArtagnans	17.117698669433594
4590/28840	But I did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said Ath	38.40022659301758
4591/28840	And I set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden j	114.49126434326172
4592/28840	Athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms   My dear CountWhen one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of	119.91049194335938
4593/28840	Now recalling former times of mutual distress I send you half my purse it is money to obtain which I made Mazarin	267.8319396972656
4594/28840	Dont make a bad use of it I entreat	55.98616027832031
4595/28840	As to what you say about not seeing you again I believe not a word of it with such a heart as yoursand such a swordone passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unal	108.46185302734375

4597/28840	Be it well understood that the fifty louis which I send are equally for Aramis as for youfor you as Aram	112.0572509765625
4598/28840	Athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a	234.8623504638672
4599/28840	DArtagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a Mazarin	42.304443359375

4601/28840	Well what shall you do with this money count Shall you keep it or send it back   I shall keep it Aramis and even though I had no need of it I still should keep	75.25506591796875
4602/28840	What is offered from a generous heart should be accepted	347.5134582519531
4603/28840	Take twentyfive of them Aramis and give me the remaining twenty	67.90642547607422

4605/28840	There now shall we start   When you like but have you no groom   No that idiot Bazin had the folly to make himself verger as you know and therefore cannot leave Notre	92.20690155029297
4606/28840	Very well take Blaisois with whom I know not what to do since I already have Grim	68.24954223632812

4609/28840	The two friends mounted as did their	436.1872253417969
4610/28840	At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin who was running breath	80.87156677246094
4611/28840	Oh sir exclaimed he thank Heaven I have arrived in	118.98261260986328
4612/28840	Monsieur Porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you	57.32435607910156
4613/28840	Good said Aramis taking a purse which Bazin presented to	57.86775207519531
4614/28840	What is this   Wait your reverence there is a	56.98937225341797
4615/28840	You know I have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier I will break every bone in your	37.01308822631836
4616/28840	How can you read asked Athos it is as dark as a cold	80.447265625
4617/28840	Wait said Bazin striking a flint and setting afire a twisted waxlight with which he started the church	198.30303955078125
4618/28840	Here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity	65.46363067626953
4619/28840	Do not fear that you put me to inconvenience if I want money I can send for some to any of my chateaux at Bracieux alone I have twenty thousand francs in	61.10295867919922
4620/28840	So if I do not send you more it is because I fear you would not accept a larger	51.81277084350586
4621/28840	I address you because you know that although I esteem him from my heart I am a little awed by the Comte de la Fere but it is understood that what I offer you I offer him at the same	30.698570251464844
4622/28840	I am as I trust you do not doubt your devoted   Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierref	15.194781303405762
4623/28840	The division being made by the light of Bazins taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined De Winter at the Porte Saint	53.072731018066406
4624/28840	In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentimes the	145.60755920410156
4625/28840	The three gentlemen took the road to Picardy a road so well known to them and which recalled to Athos and Aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their	61.660797119140625
4626/28840	It was soon time for Grimaud to recall the	161.16281127929688
4627/28840	At last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at Boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent	127.82994842529297
4628/28840	Boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights what is now called the lower town did not then	293.0341796875
4629/28840	Gentlemen said De Winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at Parislet us separate to avoid	217.00730895996094
4630/28840	I know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to	97.71094512939453
4631/28840	I will go there where I expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to LEpee du Grand Henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty our boat is waiting for us	103.18521881103516
4632/28840	The matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern	256.4472961425781
4633/28840	Their horses were fed but not unsaddled the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any	103.35549926757812
4634/28840	It is needless to say that this caution concerned Blaisois alonelong enough since it had been a useless one to Grim	61.094215393066406
4635/28840	Athos and Aramis walked down toward the	93.18238830566406
4636/28840	From their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promen	81.86376953125
4637/28840	There was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided	233.31495666503906
4638/28840	This man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jet	91.60502624511719
4639/28840	From the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to	50.25147247314453
4640/28840	On reaching the jetty Athos and Aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to	76.45208740234375
4641/28840	That is doubtless our boat said Ath	110.4664535522461
4642/28840	Yes replied Aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only De Winter does not keep us	107.83328247070312
4643/28840	It is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman	100.33837127685547
4644/28840	In truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of De Winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so	116.15802001953125
4645/28840	Gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but I see you come from Paris or at least that you are strangers at Boulog	79.55963134765625
4646/28840	He is and he is not replied Athos that is to say he is dismissed by onehalf of France but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long	68.14424896240234
4647/28840	However sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison   No sir not at this moment at	32.932212829589844
4648/28840	Sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man	115.19253540039062
4649/28840	What do you think of that interrogator asked Aram	58.64457321166992
4650/28840	I think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of	97.03800964355469
4651/28840	And you replied to him with that notion   Nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and I was so to	82.2612533569336
4652/28840	But if he be a spy   What do you think a spy would be about here We are not living in the time of Cardinal Richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare	61.19459915161133
4653/28840	It matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued Aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the	101.85482025146484
4654/28840	And you said Athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing Lord de Winters	44.709068298339844
4655/28840	Did you not see that at that name the young man stopped   More reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his	96.64231872558594
4656/28840	And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel   I am always afraid of a quarrel when I am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching	106.93888092041016
4657/28840	Besides let me own something to	308.5531311035156
4658/28840	I am anxious to see that young man	34.62726974487305
4659/28840	In ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a	181.18199157714844
4660/28840	Ah Egad cried Aramis you set me	148.77615356445312
4661/28840	I swear to you I like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my	69.70128631591797
4662/28840	Ah here is De Winter coming said Ath	72.25003051757812
4663/28840	Good one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us	135.57867431640625
4664/28840	I see them about twenty paces behind my	48.42137145996094
4665/28840	I recognize Grimaud by his long legs and his determined sl	188.9509735107422
4666/28840	Then we set sail tonight asked Aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be	109.61761474609375
4667/28840	Diable resumed Aramis I have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel I confess I prefer the convent of No	109.76622009277344
4668/28840	Athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward De	66.63987731933594
4669/28840	What ails our friend said Aramis he resembles one of Dantes damned whose neck Apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their	132.6831817626953
4670/28840	What the devil makes him glower thus behind him   When De Winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapid	100.40589904785156
4671/28840	What is the matter my lord said Athos and what puts you out of breath thus   Nothing replied De Winter nothing and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned	57.41202926635742
4672/28840	But let us go continued De Winter let us be off the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchordo you see it there I wish I were on board already and he looked back	73.22019958496094
4673/28840	He has seen him said Athos in a low tone to Aram	15.100861549377441
4674/28840	They had reached the ladder which led to the	81.52594757080078
4675/28840	De Winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow	72.85365295410156
4676/28840	At this moment Athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embark	55.82740783691406
4677/28840	He fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned	33.11252975463867
4678/28840	Athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young	99.738037109375
4679/28840	The latter to make a short cut had appeared on a slu	443.97552490234375
4680/28840	He certainly bodes us no good said Athos but let us embark once out at sea let him	97.00965118408203
4681/28840	And Athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart row	118.04588317871094
4682/28840	But the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the	59.05202102661133
4683/28840	She was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon just lighted and a rock which jutted	95.51731872558594
4684/28840	They saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it	55.5742073059082
4685/28840	Ay but said Aramis that young fellow is decidedly a	97.43495178222656
4686/28840	Which is the young man asked De Winter turning	44.646636962890625
4687/28840	He who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there behold   De Winter turned and followed the direction of Aramiss	125.38475799560547
4688/28840	The beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed	113.0797348022461
4689/28840	It is he exclaimed De Winter seizing the arm of Athos it is he I thought I recognized him and I was not	40.14017868041992
4690/28840	The young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from	83.35909271240234
4691/28840	Yes it is I my uncleI the son of MiladyI the monkI the secretary and friend of CromwellI know you now both you and your	141.398681640625
4692/28840	In that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their	330.9217224121094
4693/28840	As for Grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his	89.35887145996094
4694/28840	Ah exclaimed Aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of Milady as he says	55.766056060791016
4695/28840	Then wait said Aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from Tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the	81.72097778320312
4696/28840	Athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be	97.36802673339844
4697/28840	I had him so well at the point of my gun I should have sent a ball into his	65.55831146240234
4698/28840	It is enough to have killed the mother said Athos hoarse	53.57024383544922
4699/28840	The mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to	221.77310180664062
4700/28840	Yes but the son has done us no	95.56765747070312
4701/28840	Grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his	99.70328521728516
4702/28840	The young man burst into a	151.50193786621094
4703/28840	Ah it is certainly you he	134.0647735595703
4704/28840	His mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the	176.4954376220703
4705/28840	Be calm exclaimed Athos for Heavens sake have we ceased to be men   No said Aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether I was wrong to rid him of his dear	87.39462280273438
4706/28840	De Winter only replied by a gro	93.41332244873047
4707/28840	It was all up with him continued Aramis ah I much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal	234.11032104492188
4708/28840	Athos took Lord de Winters hand and tried to turn the	150.62538146972656
4709/28840	When shall we land in England he asked but De Winter seemed not to hear his words and made no	84.25435638427734
4710/28840	Hold Athos said Aramis perhaps there is yet	46.33620834350586
4711/28840	See if he is still in the same	27.197040557861328
4712/28840	Athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aure	118.27864074707031
4713/28840	Decidedly Aramis said Athos I think I was wrong not to let you	91.65225219726562
4714/28840	Hold your tongue replied Aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were	67.16824340820312
4715/28840	At this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were	102.86962890625
4716/28840	The captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards Hastings where they were to	167.43966674804688
4717/28840	At this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness	108.67188262939453
4718/28840	Then a voice reached them once more sending this threat To our next meeting sirs in	352.0767517089844
4719/28840	Te Deum for the Victory of	102.57231903076172
4720/28840	Such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with	310.28466796875
4721/28840	The motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of France and the uncertain hope of beating the	160.55853271484375
4722/28840	Now since the affair of Nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling Mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete	211.03713989257812
4723/28840	A council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided	101.12687683105469
4724/28840	It was only known that on the following Sunday a Te Deum would be sung at Notre Dame in honor of the victory of	75.21109008789062
4725/28840	The following Sunday then the Parisians arose with joy at that period a Te Deum was a grand affair this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great	136.15274047851562
4726/28840	The shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous Cardinal Mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his	86.93894958496094
4727/28840	Moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the Paris churches rang out the Te De	292.6070556640625
4728/28840	The police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous	308.7438659667969
4729/28840	Friquet had put on his Sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from Baz	89.1834487915039
4730/28840	In consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillors door and knocked	223.22117614746094
4731/28840	His mother the councillors old servant opened	485.5039367675781
4732/28840	And what hast thou to say boy to Monsieur Broussel   I wish to tell him replied Friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this	54.622806549072266
4733/28840	And as I hear everywhere that at the court they are illdisposed to him I wish to warn him that he may be on his	69.90762329101562
4734/28840	Broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the	100.3045883178711
4735/28840	On the contrary my boy on the contrary I am pleased with your	69.7245864868164
4736/28840	Dame Nanette look for those apricots which Madame de Longueville sent to us yesterday from Noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new	101.55719757080078
4737/28840	Oh thank you sir thank you Monsieur Broussel said Friquet I am so fond of apricots   Broussel then proceeded to his wifes room and asked for breakfast it was nine o	33.26399612426758
4738/28840	The councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around Notre	102.22032165527344
4739/28840	This noise redoubled when DArtagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of Notre Dame to secure the service of the	30.791837692260742
4740/28840	He had instructed Porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and Porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as DArtagnan had so often done	44.066741943359375
4741/28840	The sergeant of this company a veteran of the Spanish wars had recognized Porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of Tré	78.67289733886719
4742/28840	Porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great	63.16847229003906
4743/28840	At last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded char	74.18170928955078
4744/28840	Ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the	149.35018920898438
4745/28840	God save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were	90.05096435546875
4746/28840	Just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of Comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the Rue Saint Christophe now entirely	55.714786529541016
4747/28840	When it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the Rue Cocatrix as if he was waiting for some	103.69775390625
4748/28840	All the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been	105.546142578125
4749/28840	Friquet whose eye ever on the alert could alone have discovered them had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of Notre	135.3242645263672
4750/28840	Thence he saw the king the queen and Monsieur Mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on	37.39364242553711
4751/28840	Friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his	141.98770141601562
4752/28840	Hardly had the police officer observed Comminges at the end of the Rue Cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before Broussels	64.24139404296875
4753/28840	Comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and Friquet was waiting behind Comminges until the door should be	59.20226287841797
4754/28840	What dost thou there rascal asked Comm	133.28280639648438
4755/28840	I want to go into Master Broussels house captain replied Friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of Paris know so well how to assume when	133.91087341308594
4756/28840	And on what floor does he live asked Comm	96.6874008178711
4757/28840	In the whole house said Friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is	74.94959259033203
4758/28840	At this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that Master Broussel was at home and at	58.488853454589844
4759/28840	The worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which Madame de Longueville had sent to	110.01197052001953
4760/28840	At sight of the officer Broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed	131.3057098388672
4761/28840	Still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness Louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain	45.87279510498047
4762/28840	Sir said Comminges I am the bearer of an order from the	29.608226776123047
4763/28840	Very well sir replied Broussel what is this order And he held out his	55.92079544067383
4764/28840	I am commissioned to seize your person sir said Comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow	56.23208999633789
4765/28840	A thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling	159.9398956298828
4766/28840	It was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the	47.235137939453125
4767/28840	Madame Broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their fathers	53.10074996948242
4768/28840	Come sir said Comminges make haste you must obey the	81.6838607788086

4771/28840	Impossible said Louvieres sir beware of driving us to	177.20616149902344
4772/28840	Impossible cried a shrill voice from the end of the	149.82908630371094
4773/28840	Comminges turned and saw Dame Nanette her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her	132.9325714111328
4774/28840	My good Nanette be quiet I beseech you said Brous	46.37334060668945

4781/28840	They want to arrest Master Broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs   The crowd began to murmur and approached the	56.51649475097656
4782/28840	The two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of Comminges those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented	50.07668685913086
4783/28840	Dont you see them cried Friquet dont you see there they are   The coachman turning around gave Friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with	83.02562713623047
4784/28840	Ah devils coachman cried Friquet youre meddling too Wait   And regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands	150.12435913085938
4785/28840	The tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the	151.32627868652344
4786/28840	The soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the car	130.7124786376953

4790/28840	The first who advances is a dead man cried Raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling	92.17951965332031
4791/28840	Comminges so to speak threw Broussel into the carriage and sprang in after	160.30126953125
4792/28840	At this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of Comminges and broke the arm of one of the	43.61144256591797
4793/28840	Comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres appearing at the window of the second	72.19569396972656
4794/28840	Very well sir said Comminges you shall hear of this an	125.56256866455078
4795/28840	And you of me sir said Louvieres and we shall see then who can speak the loud	47.184085845947266
4796/28840	Friquet and Nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening	195.56591796875
4797/28840	Down with the officer down with him was the	196.95367431640625
4798/28840	One step nearer said Comminges putting down the sashes that the interior of the carriage might be well seen and placing his sword on his prisoners breast one step nearer and I kill the prisoner my orders were to carry him off alive or	103.15496826171875

4803/28840	But this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the	274.6764831542969
4804/28840	From time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibr	114.46430969238281
4805/28840	Voices unheard except on days of revolution were distinguished faces were seen that only appeared on days of	711.3912963867188
4806/28840	Cries of Death death to the guards to the Seine with the officer were heard above all the noise deafening as it	108.31770324707031
4807/28840	Raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he	188.58021545410156

4813/28840	Raoul was about to reply when DArtagnan bent down to his	36.4637451171875
4814/28840	Hold your tongue said he and let me	102.34445190429688
4815/28840	Do not lose time Comminges he continued get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up be quick or in five minutes the mob will be on us again with swords and muskets and you will be	101.49624633789062
4816/28840	Hold theres a carriage coming over y	354.72796630859375
4817/28840	Then bending again to Raoul he whispered Above all things do not divulge your	161.67691040039062
4818/28840	I will go said Comminges and if they come back fire   Not at allnot at all replied DArtagnan let no one	44.73310089111328
4819/28840	On the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly	161.0132598876953
4820/28840	Comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage from which he made the people inside dismount and brought them to the vehicle which had	89.1179428100586
4821/28840	But when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the	98.01216125488281
4822/28840	There are ten men to accompany	212.77549743652344

4824/28840	As the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the Quai and overflowed the Pont Neuf and adjacent	50.45208740234375
4825/28840	A few shots were fired and one musketeer was	170.0076141357422
4826/28840	Forward cried DArtagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in	68.56068420410156
4827/28840	One man alone remained in his place gun in	127.75396728515625
4828/28840	Ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated Wait an	296.92669677734375
4829/28840	And he pointed his gun at DArtagnan who was riding toward him at full	47.791988372802734
4830/28840	DArtagnan bent down to his horses neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the	59.71922302246094
4831/28840	The horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the	77.88713836669922
4832/28840	DArtagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked	61.63839340209961
4833/28840	Oh sir exclaimed Raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the Rue Cocatrix spare him it is his son   DArtagnans arm dropped to his	41.63349151611328

4837/28840	If I take you you will be hung   The young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horses head disappeared at the corner of the Rue Gueneg	32.38727951049805
4838/28840	Ifaith said DArtagnan to Raoul you were just in time to stay my	43.076377868652344
4839/28840	He was a dead man and on my honor if I had discovered that it was his son I should have regretted having killed	39.60475158691406
4840/28840	Ah sir said Raoul allow me after thanking you for that poor fellows life to thank you on my own	62.76982116699219

4843/28840	Then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the Quai from the Pont Neuf to the Quai Saint Michael he raised his sword for them to double their	48.044803619384766
4844/28840	The musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom DArtagnan had given to Comminges	33.34993362426758
4845/28840	Halloo cried DArtagnan has something fresh happened   Eh sir replied the sergeant their vehicle has broken down a second time it really must be	93.01583099365234
4846/28840	They are bad managers said DArtagnan shrugging his	12.069103240966797
4847/28840	When a carriage is chosen it ought to be	119.71145629882812
4848/28840	The carriage in which a Broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand	57.7851448059082
4849/28840	What are your commands lieutenant   Take the detachment and conduct him to his	84.2344741821289
4850/28840	But you will be left alone  	32.20262145996094
4851/28840	So you suppose I have need of an escort	128.7515411376953
4852/28840	The musketeers set off and DArtagnan was left alone with Ra	25.03873062133789
4853/28840	Now he said are you in pain   Yes my head is not only swimming but	79.84675598144531
4854/28840	Whats the matter with this head said DArtagnan raising the battered	99.61113739013672
4855/28840	Yes I think I received a flowerpot upon my	107.50823974609375
4856/28840	But were you not on horseback you have sp	107.39889526367188
4857/28840	Yes but I got down to defend Monsieur de Comminges and my horse was taken	39.097862243652344
4858/28840	At this very moment Friquet passed mounted on Raouls horse waving his particolored cap and crying Broussel Broussel   Halloo stop rascal cried DArtagn	58.19108581542969
4859/28840	Friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his	145.7703399658203
4860/28840	DArtagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue Master Friquet but not wishing to leave Raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking	46.33806228637695
4861/28840	Friquet had a quick eye and a fine	380.85784912109375
4862/28840	He saw DArtagnans movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at	63.226722717285156
4863/28840	Ah it is you your honor he said advancing toward DArtagnan and I am truly pleased to meet	46.64055252075195
4864/28840	DArtagnan looked attentively at Friquet and recognized the little chorister of the Rue de la Cal	21.039478302001953
4865/28840	Ah tis thou rascal said he come here so thou hast changed thy trade thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy thou hast become a horse stealer   Ah your honor how can you say so exclaimed Fri	174.5214080810547

4867/28840	Raoul put his hand in his	75.4601058959961
4868/28840	To give ten francs to this honest fellow replied Raoul taking a pistole from his	60.223175048828125
4869/28840	Ten kicks on his back said DArtagnan be off you little villain and forget not that I have your	107.88327026367188
4870/28840	Friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the Quai a la Rue Dauphine and	130.93649291992188
4871/28840	Raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the Rue Tiqueton	39.8023567199707
4872/28840	DArtagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own	26.296571731567383
4873/28840	They arrived without accident at the Hotel de la Chev	26.27716064453125
4874/28840	The handsome Madeleine announced to DArtagnan that Planchet had returned bringing Mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would	50.58533477783203
4875/28840	DArtagnan desired Planchet to be summoned but he had	23.86635398864746
4876/28840	You are much pleased with yourself said he to Raoul when they were alone are you not   Well yes replied Ra	45.041316986083984
4877/28840	It seems to me I did my	48.324134826660156
4878/28840	And who told you to defend the king   The Comte de la Fere	15.490500450134277
4879/28840	Yes the king but today you have not fought for the king you have fought for Mazarin which is not quite the same	45.34966278076172
4880/28840	But you yourself   Oh for me that is another	60.1475830078125
4881/28840	As for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly you have no	158.30599975585938
4882/28840	But has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a Mazarinist and helping to arrest Broussel Breathe not a word of that or the Comte de la Fere will be	53.174903869628906
4883/28840	You think the count will be angry with me   Think it Im certain of it were it not for that I should thank you for you have worked for	61.852500915527344
4884/28840	However I scold you instead of him and in his place the storm will blow over more easily believe	159.36398315429688
4885/28840	And moreover my dear child continued DArtagnan I am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your	47.067771911621094
4886/28840	I do not understand you sir said Ra	11.311758995056152
4887/28840	DArtagnan rose and taking a letter from his writingdesk presented it to Ra	45.69945526123047
4888/28840	The face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the	58.48726272583008
4889/28840	Oh mon Dieu he said raising his fine eyes to DArtagnan moist with tears the count has left Paris without seeing me   He left four days ago said DArtagn	32.63680648803711
4890/28840	But this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps	192.0203399658203
4891/28840	Heheincur danger of death No be not anxious he is traveling on business and will return ere	419.9443054199219

4893/28840	Well sir I will obey you although I do not understand	32.301822662353516
4894/28840	It is unnecessary for you to	64.20773315429688
4895/28840	Hold continued DArtagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is Monsieur du Vallon who comes with his coat	28.727190017700195
4896/28840	Yes but in exchange said Porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange I have torn many	72.57069396972656
4897/28840	Those wretches wanted to take away my sword Deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but I knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of Balizard	158.5938720703125
4898/28840	Oh Ill answer for you said the Gascon filling Porthoss glass to the brim but when you have drunk give me your	83.78581237792969
4899/28840	Look here resumed DArtagnan here is Monsieur de Bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of Broussel and whom I had great difficulty to prevent defending Monsieur de Comm	24.37723159790039
4900/28840	Will you come said he to Porth	37.1300048828125
4901/28840	Where asked Porthos filling a second glass of	27.68475914001465
4902/28840	To present our respects to the	178.95037841796875
4903/28840	Porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed DArtagn	59.568626403808594
4904/28840	As for Raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by DArtagnan to leave the room until the tumult was	39.06296157836914
4905/28840	They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely DArtagnan his captaincy Porthos his bar	58.105186462402344
4906/28840	DArtagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to Mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to	78.06446075439453
4907/28840	But though he held the cardinals promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage Porth	94.31051635742188
4908/28840	Whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for	133.03175354003906
4909/28840	Mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow	143.0500946044922
4910/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his	24.387374877929688
4911/28840	Those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queens courtiers they are costumes of	137.8969268798828
4912/28840	The court of Anne of Austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the Spaniard it had just gained another over the	77.13721466064453
4913/28840	Comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when DArtagnan and Porthos were perceived at the door behind the	37.75690460205078
4914/28840	Ah madame said Comminges hastening to DArtagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my	32.40862274169922
4915/28840	Without him I should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at Saint Cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the	71.7555923461914
4916/28840	DArtagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to	23.155662536621094
4917/28840	I know that sir I have known that said the queen a long time therefore I am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my	67.35820770263672
4918/28840	Permit me madame said DArtagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of Tréville he has done	46.89055252075195
4919/28840	In the regiment said DArtagnan he is called Porthos the queen started but his true name is the Chevalier du Vall	26.48940658569336
4920/28840	These names are too numerous for me to remember them all and I will content myself with the first said the queen gr	76.36074829101562
4921/28840	At this moment the coadjutor was announced a cry of surprise ran through the royal assembl	36.94538116455078
4922/28840	The fact was in leaving Notre Dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the	51.7542610168457
4923/28840	Although almost engaged to the leaders of the Fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a stepping	84.64347076416016
4924/28840	Monsieur de Retz wished to become archbishop in his uncles place and cardinal like Mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely	123.12569427490234
4925/28840	He therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of Lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill	121.69940948486328
4926/28840	The coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at	86.09468841552734
4927/28840	His speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their	116.73426818847656
4928/28840	He concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majestys	101.34395599365234
4929/28840	Immediately the wits of the court plunged into	631.4688720703125
4930/28840	NogentBeautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a	70.34959411621094
4931/28840	This caused a universal burst of	325.0279541015625
4932/28840	The Marechal de la Meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as Henry	34.63993453979492
4933/28840	had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of Iv	101.16275787353516

4935/28840	The queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to	95.1935806274414

4939/28840	Then turning toward Porthos The devil said he this has a bad	90.57389068603516
4940/28840	I dislike these quarrels among men of the	296.44073486328125
4941/28840	Gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his	122.69486236572266
4942/28840	Oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court faithless court cowardly court I will teach you how to laugh tomorrowbut in another	167.99708557128906
4943/28840	On his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was Louvie	41.65278244018555
4944/28840	Broussels son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the kings	215.94625854492188
4945/28840	The only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a	64.24044036865234
4946/28840	The coadjutor went to him and held out his	24.596141815185547
4947/28840	The young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his	29.430011749267578
4948/28840	My dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor believe me I am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to	19.439151763916016
4949/28840	Is that true and do you speak seriously asked Louvie	58.97601318359375
4950/28840	From the depth of my heart said Gond	27.220888137817383
4951/28840	In that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be	76.10509490966797
4952/28840	Oh let us speak frankly continued Louvieres and act in a straightforward	55.189815521240234
4953/28840	Thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure Christian charity that would be too	74.62674713134766
4954/28840	You are ambitiousit is natural you are a man of genius and you know your	77.5185546875
4955/28840	As for me I hate the court and have but one desire at this momentvenge	186.4168701171875
4956/28840	It was now the coadjutors turn to fix his piercing eyes on Louvie	46.43796920776367
4957/28840	But Monsieur Louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me   You have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you	30.477758407592773
4958/28840	Never mind said the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires	40.320865631103516
4959/28840	And how many hours of reflection do you ask   Twelve hours sir is it too long   It is now noon at midnight I will be at your	61.87055206298828
4960/28840	If I should not be in wait for	31.926612854003906
4961/28840	When once more alone Gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his	92.89433288574219
4962/28840	Two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of Paris had assembled	232.4735107421875
4963/28840	Gondy related to them the insults he had received at the Palais Royal and retailed the jests of Beautin the Count de Villeroy and Marechal de la Meillera	40.245819091796875
4964/28840	The curates asked him what was to be	107.13890075683594
4965/28840	You are the directors of all consci	171.1048126220703
4966/28840	For the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound I will listen to him with the greatest	104.62640380859375
4967/28840	You think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers said Gond	69.01448059082031
4968/28840	My lord I have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to	63.713016510009766
4969/28840	Who and what is this man   A shopkeeper in the Rue des Lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his	41.25687026977539
4970/28840	What is his name   He is named Planchet who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago but as he was searched for after this emeute he	72.55999755859375
4971/28840	And can you find him   I hope	39.747798919677734
4972/28840	I think he has not been arrested and as I am his wifes confessor if she knows where he is I shall know it	48.96430969238281
4973/28840	Very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to	90.82425689697266
4974/28840	We will be with you at six oclock my	38.91625213623047
4975/28840	Go my dear curate and may God assist you   And you sir continued Gondy turning to the curate of	31.839279174804688
4976/28840	I my lord said the latter I know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of	70.80300903320312
4977/28840	Him I can place at your disposal it is Count de Roche	109.12696838378906
4978/28840	I know him also but unfortunately he is not in	47.61869812011719
4979/28840	My lord he has been for three days at the Rue Cass	81.2418441772461
4980/28840	And wherefore has he not been to see me   He was toldmy lord will pardon me   Certainly	85.1470947265625
4981/28840	That your lordship was about to treat with the	52.01927947998047
4982/28840	Diable think what a solemn engagement you are making one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other a count you are going then to offer a prince are you   I offer you a beggar my	106.68716430664062
4983/28840	Bravo and the man   A plain and simple beggar as I have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives holy water a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of	105.9075698852539
4984/28840	Well the man whom I offer you is a general synd	92.93181610107422
4985/28840	And what do you know of him   Nothing my lord except that he is tormented with	35.57363510131836
4986/28840	What makes you think so   On the twentyeighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death yesterday I said this mass	114.35639190673828
4987/28840	And his name   Maillard but I do not think it is his right	34.37562561035156
4988/28840	And think you that we should find him at this hour at his post  	48.6807861328125
4989/28840	Let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are rightit will be you who have discovered the true	67.03276824951172
4990/28840	Gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the cur	120.2499771118164
4991/28840	The coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the	58.19746780395508
4992/28840	Eustache Church watching carefully to ascertain the popular	470.1841125488281
4993/28840	The people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle	105.05302429199219
4994/28840	On arriving at the Rue des Prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the	143.4832763671875
4995/28840	Stop he said there he is at his	42.47367477416992
4996/28840	Gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his	77.77424621582031
4997/28840	Is it by permission that he remains there asked Gond	116.97090148925781
4998/28840	No my lord these places are	409.424072265625
4999/28840	I believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for	74.38829040527344
5000/28840	The rascal is rich then   Some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twentyfive and thirty thousand francs and sometimes	104.59053039550781
5001/28840	Hum said Gondy laughing I was not aware my alms were so well	49.09749221801758
5002/28840	In the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his	60.71091079711914
5003/28840	He was a man between sixtysix and sixtyeight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light	112.57063293457031
5004/28840	His countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principlesa wicked nature subdued by determination perhaps by	334.57177734375
5005/28840	He started on seeing the cavalier with the cur	41.92700958251953
5006/28840	The latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the	35.479732513427734
5007/28840	Maillard began the curate this gentleman and I have come to talk with you a	125.05003356933594
5008/28840	With me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy	35.5417594909668
5009/28840	There was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadj	41.05191421508789
5010/28840	Yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of today and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the	93.05477905273438
5011/28840	These are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the	495.4385681152344
5012/28840	As to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means	238.7083740234375
5013/28840	Explain yourself my good friend said the coadj	40.38114929199219
5014/28840	I mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide	113.69708251953125
5015/28840	The war will not only be approved of but directed by the	226.64202880859375
5016/28840	As for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of Paris who has the very greatest power at the court of Rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences we will recommend you to	76.05009460449219
5017/28840	Consider Maillard said the curate that I have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that I have made myself responsible for	47.40463638305664
5018/28840	I know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore I in my turn will be serviceable to	32.920963287353516
5019/28840	Ah ah said Gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades   I will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend	64.35111999511719
5020/28840	Ifaith exclaimed Gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le curé can answer for you   I answer for him said the cur	41.9825439453125
5021/28840	Here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold make all your arrangements and tell me where I shall be able to find you this evening at ten o	35.05613327026367
5022/28840	It must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of	138.30996704101562
5023/28840	Shall I give you a line for the vicar of	120.73392486572266
5024/28840	Jacques de la Boucherie he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the cur	67.48452758789062
5025/28840	Then said the coadjutor this evening at ten oclock and if I am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your	21.516374588012695
5026/28840	The eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his	75.70626068115234
5027/28840	This evening sir he replied all will be	169.33917236328125
5028/28840	At a quarter to six oclock Monsieur de Gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal	30.370237350463867
5029/28840	At six oclock the curate of	31.98127555847168
5030/28840	The coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another	49.06845474243164
5031/28840	The curate then entered followed by Planc	45.13142776489258
5032/28840	Your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom I had the honor to speak to	22.288612365722656
5033/28840	Planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine	82.76045227050781
5034/28840	And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked Gond	32.129878997802734
5035/28840	I am a Frondist from my	27.72516441345215
5036/28840	You see in me such as I am a person sentenced to be	105.91064453125
5037/28840	And on what account   I rescued from the hands of Mazarins police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the Bastile where he had been for five	43.08224105834961
5038/28840	Will you name him   Oh you know him well my lordit is Count de Roche	53.41550064086914
5039/28840	Ah really yes said the coadjutor I have heard this affair	60.83070373535156
5040/28840	You raised the whole district so they told me   Very nearly replied Planchet with a selfsatisfied	93.7508544921875
5041/28840	And your business is   That of a confectioner in the Rue des Lomb	21.45536994934082
5042/28840	Explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike incl	231.3632049560547
5043/28840	Well my lord before I became a confectioner I myself was three years sergeant in the Piedmontese regiment and before I became sergeant I was for eighteen months the servant of Monsieur dArtagn	54.67990493774414
5044/28840	But he is said to be a furious Mazarin	77.28211975097656
5045/28840	You are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you   You may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the	70.6119155883789
5046/28840	How many men think you you could collect together tonight   Two hundred muskets and five hundred halber	97.80347442626953
5047/28840	Let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by tomorrow we shall have quite a powerful	112.89305114746094
5048/28840	Are you disposed to obey Count de Rochefort   I would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as I believe him entirely capable of the	79.1627426147461
5049/28840	Bravo   By what sign tomorrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes   Every Frondist must put a knot of straw in his	130.90835571289062
5050/28840	Do you want money   Money never comes amiss at any time my lord if one has it not one must do without it with it matters go on much better and more	162.4450225830078
5051/28840	Gondy went to a box and drew forth a	76.53006744384766
5052/28840	Here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum	129.12823486328125
5053/28840	I will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said Planchet putting the bag under his	53.91036605834961
5054/28840	That is right I recommend the cardinal to your	235.52268981933594
5055/28840	Make your mind easy he is in good	110.59796142578125
5056/28840	Planchet went out the curate remaining for a	40.92914962768555
5057/28840	Are you satisfied my lord he	86.89488983154297
5058/28840	Yes he appears to be a resolute	73.28545379638672
5059/28840	Well he will do more than he has	68.12351989746094
5060/28840	The curate rejoined Planchet who was waiting for him on the	23.249942779541016
5061/28840	Ten minutes later the curate of	56.3066520690918
5062/28840	As soon as the door of Gondys study was opened a man rushed	94.0682601928711
5063/28840	Tis you then my dear count cried Gondy offering his	34.212867736816406
5064/28840	You have made up your mind at last my lord said Roche	34.11378479003906
5065/28840	It has been made up a long time said Gond	18.72182273864746
5066/28840	Let us say no more on the subject you tell me so I believe	45.71154022216797
5067/28840	Well we are going to give a ball to Maz	40.44942092895508
5068/28840	And when will the dance begin   The invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until tomorrow	74.81340789794922
5069/28840	You may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the Chevalier dHumieres has promised me whenever I need	51.044376373291016
5070/28840	Upon fifty soldiers   Yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over I shall replace	84.45048522949219
5071/28840	Good my dear Rochefort but that is not	26.819988250732422
5072/28840	What have you done with Monsieur de Beaufort   He is in Vendome where he will wait until I write to him to return to	26.385133743286133
5073/28840	You are sure of your enterprise   Yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of Paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead	95.97203826904297
5074/28840	If he defers he will find the place of honor	150.7981414794922
5075/28840	Shall I send word to him as coming from you   Yes	83.6699447631836
5076/28840	Shall I tell him that he can count on you   To the	51.83000564575195
5077/28840	And you will leave the command to him   Of the war yes but in politics   You must know it is not his	56.32942581176758
5078/28840	He must leave me to negotiate for my cardinals hat in my own	71.36270904541016
5079/28840	You care about it then so much   Since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said Gondy I wish at least that the hat should be	82.03758239746094
5080/28840	One must not dispute matters of taste and colors said Rochefort	265.5691833496094
5081/28840	How soon can he be here   In five	60.55781555175781
5082/28840	Let him come and he will find a change I will answer for	46.05488204956055
5083/28840	Therefore go and collect your fifty men and hold yourself in	206.91920471191406
5084/28840	Is there any signal for the general rally   A knot of straw in the	72.7251205444336
5085/28840	Ah Monsieur Mazarin Monsieur Mazarin said Rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether I am too old to be a man of	35.599300384521484
5086/28840	It was halfpast nine oclock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishops palace to the tower of	31.829261779785156
5087/28840	He remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the	70.6553955078125
5088/28840	Good said he our syndic is at his	124.75675964355469
5089/28840	He knocked and the door was	49.14834213256836
5090/28840	Although the key was in the door the coadjutor	38.055267333984375
5091/28840	Come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle	59.01201629638672
5092/28840	He rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten oclock	23.817689895629883

5095/28840	You are not boasting   Do you wish for a proof  	24.252927780151367
5096/28840	There were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the Palais Royal and a third upon the Rue Saint	84.5011215209961
5097/28840	The man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the	143.30999755859375

5104/28840	For twenty years I have tasted nothing but	175.25743103027344
5105/28840	The man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold	43.29457092285156
5106/28840	Ah ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good	43.606651306152344
5107/28840	The mendicant sighed and threw down the	193.90167236328125

5110/28840	His face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward	88.6650390625
5111/28840	Singular man muttered Gondy taking his hat to go away but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the	82.3671875
5112/28840	His first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasp	46.321044921875
5113/28840	Your blessing your holiness before you go I beseech you he	62.015193939208984

5115/28840	No your holiness I take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor I recognized you at the first	34.248294830322266
5116/28840	And you want my blessing he	151.10275268554688
5117/28840	The mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that Gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was	45.60559844970703
5118/28840	Now said Gondy there is a communion between	30.387939453125

5130/28840	It was about eleven oclock at	42.14665603637695
5131/28840	Gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of	63.521236419677734
5132/28840	The whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horse	338.71533203125
5133/28840	Gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind of fear he asked himself if after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens he should have the power of making them retire	101.93800354003906
5134/28840	He felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach	158.0647735595703
5135/28840	These men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had	187.876708984375
5136/28840	One individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he	121.22513580322266
5137/28840	By the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized Planc	30.178773880004883
5138/28840	The coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the Rue de la Monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower	83.79144287109375
5139/28840	They were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to	291.4860534667969
5140/28840	All these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a mus	84.87210083007812
5141/28840	On reaching the Pont Neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached	46.866546630859375
5142/28840	I do not know you for one of	22.902790069580078
5143/28840	Then it is because you do not know your friends my dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor raising his	11.615599632263184
5144/28840	Gondy continued his way and went as far as the Tour de Nes	137.61788940429688
5145/28840	There he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the	115.01103210449219
5146/28840	They might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white clo	58.838768005371094
5147/28840	When they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their	87.38353729248047
5148/28840	Gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but	133.87594604492188
5149/28840	The last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived Gond	95.0074234008789
5150/28840	He walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his	71.68046569824219
5151/28840	Halloo Monsieur de Rochefort said Gondy laughing are you a boy to play with firearms   Rochefort recognized the	35.52510070800781
5152/28840	Ah it is you my lord said	28.755218505859375
5153/28840	What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth   My fifty recruits from the Chevalier dHumieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white clo	63.66852569580078
5154/28840	And where are you going   To the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his	64.91046142578125
5155/28840	Very good said Gondy shaking Rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after	78.54324340820312
5156/28840	It was now one oclock in the morning and the coadjutor returned	18.446317672729492
5157/28840	He opened a window and leaned out to	76.52513885498047
5158/28840	A strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as oceans most unfathomable	215.996826171875
5159/28840	From time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an	159.69969177246094
5160/28840	The work of revolt continued the whole night	428.49432373046875
5161/28840	The next morning on awaking Paris seemed to be startled at her own	107.67533874511719
5162/28840	Armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every	289.85577392578125
5163/28840	Those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry Long live Broussel Down with Mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even	159.53907775878906
5164/28840	They had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not	80.29798889160156
5165/28840	The barricades had been pushed as far as the Palais	40.01890563964844
5166/28840	Then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were	81.80059051513672
5167/28840	Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his	179.8290252685547
5168/28840	As for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the Marechal de la Meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasant	37.39957046508789
5169/28840	The marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually	256.94647216796875
5170/28840	He took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the Pont du Louvre but there he met Rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred	53.41752624511719
5171/28840	The marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the qu	143.21961975097656
5172/28840	But at Pont Neuf he found Louvieres and his	43.94735336303711
5173/28840	This time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the	165.3226776123047
5174/28840	He beat a retreat toward the market but there he met Planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him threatening	85.23666381835938
5175/28840	He attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the Rue Saint Honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of	96.6627426147461
5176/28840	The marshal then entered the Rue Saint Honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of Saint Eust	23.055734634399414
5177/28840	They were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and	236.24276733398438
5178/28840	Master Friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which Louvieres had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous	61.52780532836914
5179/28840	The marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through	200.97109985351562
5180/28840	He dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the	118.49060821533203
5181/28840	The Marechal de la Meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he	28.403125762939453
5182/28840	He returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the	131.40196228027344
5183/28840	The guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of	326.2017822265625
5184/28840	Men fell around him as they had fallen at Rocroy or at Ler	77.37677764892578

5186/28840	The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet	49.7624626159668
5187/28840	Get me out of this in Heavens name he said or I shall leave my carcass here and those of all my	95.12873840332031
5188/28840	A great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been	62.879615783691406
5189/28840	Gondy raised his hand and demanded	153.2662353515625
5190/28840	My children he said this is the Marechal de la Meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the Louvre to demand of the queen in your name our Broussels	43.83731460571289
5191/28840	You pledge yourself to that marshal added Gondy turning to La Meillera	59.81797790527344
5192/28840	Morbleu cried the latter I should say that I do pledge myself to it I had no hope of getting off so	80.34463500976562
5193/28840	He gives you his word of honor said Gond	53.418216705322266
5194/28840	The marshal raised his hand in token of ass	30.07966423034668
5195/28840	Long live the coadjutor cried the	59.742835998535156
5196/28840	It was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed	207.6276397705078
5197/28840	In the meantime as we have said Mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in	62.88851547241211
5198/28840	He called for DArtagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him DArtagnan not being on	48.02545928955078
5199/28840	In about ten minutes DArtagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable Porth	21.53586196899414
5200/28840	Ah come in come in Monsieur dArtagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend	42.0987434387207
5201/28840	But what is going on in this accursed Paris   What is going on my lord nothing good replied DArtagnan shaking his	32.530784606933594
5202/28840	Down with Mazarin Ifaith the treasonable word is	212.14598083496094

5206/28840	As for Porthoss coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in	110.96224212646484
5207/28840	Diavolo said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration I should have cried I	72.35932159423828
5208/28840	At this moment the tumult was heard	211.1351776123047
5209/28840	Mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around	352.5837707519531
5210/28840	He had a great desire to go to the window but he dared	31.61546516418457
5211/28840	See what is going on Monsieur DArtagnan said	11.113109588623047
5212/28840	DArtagnan went to the window with his habitual	15.923013687133789
5213/28840	But if they fire all is lost cried DArtagn	37.247196197509766
5214/28840	The gates to hold for five minutesthe gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder Gods death dont fire screamed DArtagnan throwing open the	278.6738586425781
5215/28840	In spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible	89.95152282714844
5216/28840	The balls might be heard peppering the facade of the Palais Royal and one of them passing under DArtagnans arm entered and broke a mirror in which Porthos was complacently admiring	44.2249870300293
5217/28840	But what do you advise then asked Mazarin	46.10540008544922
5218/28840	Eh egad to give up Broussel as they demand What the devil do you want with a member of the parliament He is of no earthly use to	86.96332550048828
5219/28840	And you Monsieur du Vallon is that your advice What would you do   I should give up Broussel said Porth	19.6485538482666

5221/28840	I will go and discuss the matter with the	42.22359848022461
5222/28840	He stopped at the end of the corridor and said   I can count upon you gentlemen can I not   We do not give ourselves twice over said DArtagnan we have given ourselves to you command we shall	42.18798828125
5223/28840	Very well then said Mazarin enter this cabinet and wait till I come	98.01847839355469
5224/28840	And turning off he entered the drawingroom by another	131.08505249023438
5225/28840	The queen was standing in the room pale with anger her selfcontrol however was so great that it might have been imagined that she was	75.19843292236328
5226/28840	Comminges Villequier and Guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the	118.978759765625
5227/28840	Then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was	129.16229248046875
5228/28840	Fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to	111.72986602783203
5229/28840	Then disguised in the clothes of the Marquis dO he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street	65.9112548828125
5230/28840	During the recital Mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to	51.30779266357422
5231/28840	Well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking what do you think of it all   I think that matters look very gloomy mad	42.468143463134766
5232/28840	But what step would you propose to me   I could propose one to your majesty but I dare	51.22347640991211
5233/28840	You may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile you were not so timid	62.36371994018555
5234/28840	The chancellor reddened and stammered some	199.53182983398438
5235/28840	It is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen you said you could give me advicewhat is it   Madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release Brous	50.80170440673828
5236/28840	The queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was	426.38580322265625
5237/28840	Release Broussel she cried never   At this moment steps were heard in the anteroom and without any announcement the Marechal de la Meilleraie appeared at the	22.180248260498047
5238/28840	Ah there you are marechal cried Anne of Austria joy	48.46246337890625

5247/28840	Oh oh monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission   The irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the mare	73.83403778076172
5248/28840	Pardon madame he said I am not a lawyer I am a mere soldier and probably therefore I do not quite comprehend the value of certain words I ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the	73.67423248291016
5249/28840	As for what you do me the honor to say I presume you mean I was afraid   The queen	37.922569274902344
5250/28840	Well then madame yes I did feel fear and though I have been through twelve pitched battles and I cannot count how many charges and skirmishes I own for the third time in my life I was	96.36677551269531
5251/28840	Yes and I would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from I know not whence unless from deepest	336.98980712890625
5252/28840	Bravo said DArtagnan in a whisper to Porthos well	38.489295959472656
5253/28840	Well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people   That Broussel shall be given up to them mad	39.63835525512695
5254/28840	Never said the queen never   Your majesty is mistress said La Meilleraie retreating a few	47.21879959106445
5255/28840	Where are you going marechal asked the	37.674564361572266
5256/28840	To give your majestys reply to those who await	43.24139404296875
5257/28840	Stay marechal I will not appear to parley with	69.3165512084961
5258/28840	Madame I have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested I shall be forced to	49.509376525878906
5259/28840	Anne of Austrias eyes shot glances of	688.7430419921875
5260/28840	Oh that is no impediment sir said she I have had greater men than you arrestedGuitant   Mazarin sprang	114.44062042236328
5261/28840	Madame said he if I dared in my turn advise   Would it be to give up Broussel sir If so you can spare yourself the	88.17457580566406
5262/28840	No said Mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any	101.38538360595703
5263/28840	Then what may it be   To call for monsieur le coadjute	13.643244743347168
5264/28840	The coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker It is he who has raised all this	105.63481140136719
5265/28840	The more reason said Mazarin if he has raised it he can put it	96.70801544189453
5266/28840	And hold madame suggested Comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the Palais	65.53855895996094
5267/28840	It is true she said the arch hypocritesee   I see said Mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst I were I in his place though I am cardinal should be torn to	84.51659393310547
5268/28840	I persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadj	56.449459075927734
5269/28840	And wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low	54.559303283691406
5270/28840	Monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moments reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to	21.637544631958008
5271/28840	And what shall I say to the people   That they must have patience said Anne as I	41.522586822509766
5272/28840	The fiery Spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply he bowed and went	70.76895904541016
5273/28840	We shall soon see said Porthos in his tranquil	44.58152770996094
5274/28840	In the meantime Anne of Austria approached Comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst Mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by DArtagnan and Porth	35.7461051940918
5275/28840	Ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadj	24.849994659423828
5276/28840	There madame he said is Monsieur Gondy who hastens to obey your majestys	28.543922424316406
5277/28840	The queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protr	118.69039154052734
5278/28840	Well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot   That it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a	38.77827072143555
5279/28840	The revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried Anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the	91.15969848632812
5280/28840	Revolt thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it but wait wait the kings authority will put all this to	154.2890625
5281/28840	Is it true asked Gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion   Yes said the queen it is	42.022621154785156
5282/28840	Your majesty wishes then   You to say what you would do in her place Mazarin hastened to	89.5634994506836
5283/28840	The coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the	33.76426315307617
5284/28840	Were I in her majestys place said Gondy coldly I should not hesitate I should release Brous	41.83030700683594
5285/28840	And if I do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the	44.6175651550293
5286/28840	I believe that not a stone in Paris will remain unturned put in the mare	95.16893768310547
5287/28840	It was not your opinion that I asked said the queen sharply without even turning	92.94476318359375
5288/28840	If it is I whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner I reply that I hold monsieur le marechals opinion in every	76.24232482910156
5289/28840	The color mounted to the queens face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with	140.584716796875
5290/28840	Mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was	429.5404968261719
5291/28840	Give up Broussel she cried fine counsel	246.67799377441406
5292/28840	Upon my word one can easily see it comes from a	92.68425750732422
5293/28840	Gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by	100.8635482788086
5294/28840	He looked coldly at the queen who nudged Mazarin to make him say something in his	65.08914947509766
5295/28840	Mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying	1203.333740234375
5296/28840	Ho ho said he good advice advice of a	258.9841613769531
5297/28840	I too would give up that good Monsieur Broussel dead or alive and all would be at an	46.95858383178711
5298/28840	If you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you	139.03553771972656
5299/28840	Did I say dead or alive replied Maz	72.07144927978516
5300/28840	It was only a way of	81.2817153930664
5301/28840	You know I am not familiar with the French language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so	38.44162368774414
5302/28840	This is a council of state DArtagnan remarked to Porthos but we held better ones at La Rochelle with Athos and Aram	35.136653900146484
5303/28840	At the Saint Gervais bastion said Porth	45.27650451660156
5304/28840	The coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity   Madame if the opinion I have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to	64.69950103759766
5305/28840	I know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a	98.91167449951172
5306/28840	Thus then it is your opinion said Anne of Austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterdays riot which today is already a rebellion tomorrow may become a revolution   Yes madame replied the coadjutor grave	44.66240310668945
5307/28840	But if I am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all	81.77114868164062
5308/28840	It is a bad year for kings said Gondy shaking his head look at England mad	40.589847564697266
5309/28840	Yes but fortunately we have no Oliver Cromwell in France replied the	44.155208587646484
5310/28840	Who knows said Gondy such men are like thunderboltsone recognizes them only when they have	162.85910034179688
5311/28840	Every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her	44.43645477294922
5312/28840	Porthos murmured DArtagnan look well at that	46.4123649597168
5313/28840	What then   Well he is a	20.26156997680664
5314/28840	Evidently he did not understand his	238.86036682128906
5315/28840	Your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but I foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the riot	107.13809204101562
5316/28840	In that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us said the queen ironically will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon	52.58216857910156
5317/28840	Perhaps it will be too late said Gondy still unmoved perhaps I shall have lost all influence while by giving up Broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the	63.20724868774414
5318/28840	Have I not then that right cried the	101.9943618774414
5319/28840	If you have it use it replied Gond	46.49935531616211
5320/28840	There is a man after my own	89.4277114868164
5321/28840	Oh if he were minister and I were his DArtagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a Mazarin mordieu what fine things we would do together   Yes said Porth	64.96233367919922
5322/28840	The queen made a sign for every one except Mazarin to quit the room and Gondy bowed as if to leave with the	58.632240295410156
5323/28840	Good thought Gondy she is going to	55.123722076416016
5324/28840	She is going to have him killed said DArtagnan to Porthos but at all events it shall not be by	23.351806640625
5325/28840	I swear to Heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him I will fall upon	55.9576301574707
5326/28840	Good muttered Mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something	97.04953002929688
5327/28840	The queens eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned	121.44295501708984
5328/28840	It was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and	141.91148376464844
5329/28840	And now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjute	27.92138671875
5330/28840	It is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release Broussel from prison and give him back to the	81.81249237060547
5331/28840	The coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the	72.9841079711914
5332/28840	At the first words of this address DArtagnan had seized Porthoss arm which he pressed with gradually increasing	77.55304718017578
5333/28840	When Mazarin ceased speaking he said to Porthos in a low tone   Never tell Mazarin that I understand Spanish or I am a lost man and you are	56.817832946777344
5334/28840	The queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said   Pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what I	195.29147338867188
5335/28840	A woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex I am alarmed at the idea of civil war a queen accustomed to be obeyed I am excited at the first	92.29663848876953
5336/28840	Madame replied Gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as	96.0702896118164
5337/28840	Your majesty has none but submissive and respectful	471.3161315917969
5338/28840	It is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for Broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your	67.70298767089844
5339/28840	Ah how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought Gond	90.3781967163086
5340/28840	And what will he promise us said DArtagn	49.86897277832031
5341/28840	Peste if he is giving away hats like that Porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment	142.3999481201172
5342/28840	Corbleu let the civil war last but one year and I will have a constables sword gilt for	221.7030029296875
5343/28840	For you I will give you the baton of the Marechal de la Meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just	23.139196395874023
5344/28840	And so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public	77.64896392822266
5345/28840	Seriously said Gondy astonished at not having further advanced I fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful	239.845458984375
5346/28840	And I said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose	159.15652465820312
5347/28840	Gondy looked at Mazarin astonished and Mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the Palais	33.18349075317383
5348/28840	Gondy smiled the queens color rose and Mazarin grew even pal	243.94329833984375
5349/28840	At this moment Comminges rushed into the	49.315673828125
5350/28840	Pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors what are your commands   Listen madame said Gond	47.549652099609375
5351/28840	The moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano cannot be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that	116.7253646850586
5352/28840	What are my commands said the	73.77100372314453
5353/28840	How many men have you about the Palais Royal   Six	54.118892669677734
5354/28840	Place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for	96.07771301269531
5355/28840	Madame cried Mazarin what are you about   Go said the	29.90140151977539
5356/28840	Comminges went out with a soldiers passive	356.0888366699219
5357/28840	At this moment a monstrous battering was	111.60935974121094
5358/28840	One of the gates began to	79.44026184082031
5359/28840	Oh madame cried Mazarin you have ruined us allthe king yourself and	97.66450500488281
5360/28840	At this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal Anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled Comm	184.82351684570312
5361/28840	It is too late said Mazarin tearing his hair too late   The gale had given	47.63256072998047
5362/28840	Hoarse shouts were heard from the excited	796.730712890625
5363/28840	DArtagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to Porthos to follow his	17.934968948364258
5364/28840	Save the queen cried Mazarin to the coadj	22.012983322143555
5365/28840	Gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized Louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand	37.96678924560547
5366/28840	Not a step further he shouted the queen is signing   What are you saying asked the	56.0990104675293
5367/28840	The truth madame said Mazarin placing a pen and a paper before her you must then he added Sign Anne I implore youI command	115.4165267944336
5368/28840	The queen fell into a chair took the pen and	109.84921264648438
5369/28840	The people kept back by Louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people	220.75704956054688
5370/28840	The queen had written The keeper of the prison at Saint Germain will set Councillor Broussel at liberty and she had signed	60.16637420654297
5371/28840	The coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his	104.34603881835938
5372/28840	And now that you have obtained what you want go said she Monsieur de Gond	29.146114349365234
5373/28840	Whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows I am at her	39.42517852783203
5374/28840	Ah cursed priest cried Anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door one day I will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me	148.5148162841797
5375/28840	Leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the	39.34856033325195
5376/28840	It is you who are not a woman muttered Maz	66.04546356201172
5377/28840	Then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left DArtagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard	24.651195526123047
5378/28840	He knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed	63.392276763916016
5379/28840	At the queens last word DArtagnan had dragged Porthos into the	53.3134880065918
5380/28840	Thither Mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and	47.329280853271484
5381/28840	Why did you leave the closet Monsieur dArtagnan asked the	18.629859924316406
5382/28840	Because replied DArtagnan the queen desired every one to leave and I thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the	48.59654998779297
5383/28840	And you have been here since   About a quarter of an hour said DArtagnan motioning to Porthos not to contradict	17.983600616455078
5384/28840	Mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that DArtagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his	109.78009796142578
5385/28840	Decidedly Monsieur dArtagnan you are the man I have been	36.340911865234375
5386/28840	You may reckon upon me and so may your	162.10935974121094
5387/28840	Then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he reentered his closet more calmly for on the departure of De Gondy the uproar had ceased as though by	54.142555236816406
5388/28840	Anne of Austria returned to her oratory	152.46885681152344
5389/28840	a prisoner at Vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing and now for a Brousselgood God what then is to become of royalty   The queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting	139.51316833496094
5390/28840	The people had made no demonstration for the princes but they had risen for Broussel they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending Broussel they instinctively felt they were defending	71.8337173461914
5391/28840	During this time Mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful Venetian mirror starred in every	46.819705963134766
5392/28840	Ah he said it is sad I know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw we shall have our	119.17033386230469
5393/28840	What matters it about Brousselit is a name not a	77.79812622070312
5394/28840	Mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken Broussel was a thing not a	346.3016052246094
5395/28840	The latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of Anne of	116.79579162597656
5396/28840	The coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three	393.1657409667969

5475/28840	They were both aroused at seven oclock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for DArtagn	62.9459114074707
5476/28840	Friend Porthos said DArtagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and I of my captain	32.48966979980469

5502/28840	So much the worse sir said Anne of Austria so much the worse at least for the queen for today she has need of the same courage and the same	51.96230697631836
5503/28840	She had many a time felt humiliated by the selfsacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the Gascon	120.93841552734375
5504/28840	She had allowed herself to be exceeded in	206.64430236816406
5505/28840	All that you tell me of those by whom I am surrounded Monsieur dArtagnan is doubtless true said the queen but I have confidence in you	32.602020263671875

5515/28840	The queen although astonished at this language to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which DArtagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her	124.04978942871094
5516/28840	It was one of the Gascons artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough	84.73296356201172
5517/28840	Has the queen any further commands for me now asked DArtagn	53.64984893798828

5520/28840	Then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinals	68.8440933227539
5521/28840	I come for your commands my lord he	56.95003890991211
5522/28840	And according to his custom DArtagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that Mazarin had a sealed letter before	61.208988189697266
5523/28840	But it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was	48.40115737915039

5557/28840	You were right he said my dear Monsieur dArtagnan and you cannot set out	21.328866958618164
5558/28840	I beg you to return me that	93.17185974121094
5559/28840	DArtagnan obeyed and Mazarin ascertained that the seal was	29.26398468017578
5560/28840	I shall want you this evening he said Return in two	81.33258056640625
5561/28840	My lord said DArtagnan I have an appointment in two hours which I cannot	26.94812774658203
5562/28840	Do not be uneasy said Mazarin it is the	37.08473587036133
5563/28840	Good thought DArtagnan I fancied it was	15.790871620178223
5564/28840	Return then at five oclock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon with	25.27008819580078
5565/28840	Only leave him in the anteroom as I wish to speak to you	25.056556701660156
5566/28840	DArtagnan bowed and thought Both at the same hour both commands alike both at the Palais	59.85652160644531
5567/28840	Monsieur de Gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret   You are thoughtful said Mazarin uneas	16.99799156188965
5568/28840	Yes I was thinking whether we ought to come armed or	154.13751220703125
5569/28840	Very well my lord it shall be	64.16761016845703
5570/28840	DArtagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend Mazarins flattering promises which gave Porthos an indescribable	38.76380157470703
5571/28840	When DArtagnan returned to the Palais Royal at five oclock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejo	28.25228500366211
5572/28840	The queen had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask	64.38043212890625
5573/28840	The return also of the conqueror of Lens was the pretext for giving a grand	199.39744567871094
5574/28840	The princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her	184.77452087402344
5575/28840	Anne of Austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that dayradiant with grace and	129.6254119873047
5576/28840	Mazarin disappeared as they rose from	2370.940185546875
5577/28840	He found DArtagnan waiting for him already at his post in the anter	31.30879783630371
5578/28840	The cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his	48.613075256347656
5579/28840	dArtagnan said the minister sitting down I am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an	66.27500915527344
5580/28840	I hope said DArtagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that I am worthy of	34.85529708862305
5581/28840	More worthy than any one in Paris my dear friend therefore I apply to	86.04076385498047
5582/28840	We are about to leave this evening continued Maz	59.65825653076172
5583/28840	dArtagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your	85.16236114501953
5584/28840	Explain yourself my lord I am	138.2045440673828
5585/28840	The queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to Saint Germ	51.37842559814453
5586/28840	Aha said DArtagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave	29.1701602935791
5587/28840	It was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o	66.24480438232422
5588/28840	Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one muttered DArtagn	61.28839874267578
5589/28840	Oh women women whether queens or not they are always the	604.9415283203125
5590/28840	Do you disapprove of this journey my dear	91.6130142211914
5591/28840	I my lord said DArtagnan why should I   Because you shrug your	31.182432174682617
5592/28840	It is a way I have of speaking to	85.36393737792969
5593/28840	I neither approve nor disapprove my lord I merely await your	192.9082489013672
5594/28840	Good it is you accordingly that I have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to Saint Germ	53.557064056396484
5595/28840	You see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving DArtagnans composure that as I have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your	54.342987060546875
5596/28840	Yes my lord and I feel the whole responsibility of such a	66.8453140258789
5597/28840	You accept however   I always	169.2625732421875
5598/28840	Do you think the thing possible   Everything is	93.4610824584961
5599/28840	Shall you be attacked on the road  	91.84115600585938
5600/28840	And what will you do in that case   I shall pass through those who attack	46.26642990112305
5601/28840	And suppose you cannot pass through them   So much the worse for them I shall pass over	45.510135650634766
5602/28840	And you will place the king and queen in safety also at Saint Germain  	42.28312683105469
5603/28840	On your life   On my	44.18862533569336
5604/28840	You are a hero my friend said Mazarin gazing at the musketeer with	48.948795318603516
5605/28840	And I asked Mazarin after a moments	50.51530075073242
5606/28840	How and you my lord   If I wish to leave   That would be much more	26.506134033203125
5607/28840	Why so   Your eminence might be	37.71771240234375
5608/28840	Even under this disguise asked Mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with	125.44515991210938
5609/28840	If your eminence is disguised it will be almost	67.12345123291016
5610/28840	Take care that the French do not take their revenge on you for the Sicilian vesp	137.87095642089844
5611/28840	The streets are full of armed men continued DArtagn	65.31596374511719
5612/28840	Are you sure that no one is aware of the queens project   Mazarin	62.90171432495117
5613/28840	This affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for	116.2317123413086
5614/28840	Mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn	180.10716247558594
5615/28840	And therefore added he quietly I have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that I have fixed upon you to escort	76.05546569824219
5616/28840	Shall you not go with the queen   No replied Maz	32.49534225463867
5617/28840	Then you will start after the queen   No said Mazarin	47.84872055053711
5618/28840	Ah said DArtagnan who began to	13.247472763061523
5619/28840	With the queen I double her risk after the queen her departure would double mine then the court once safe I might be	340.33721923828125
5620/28840	Very true said DArtagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queens diamond which Mazarin wore on his	27.89246368408203
5621/28840	Mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring	316.7551574707031
5622/28840	I wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to	57.753658294677734
5623/28840	It is but Christian charity replied DArtagnan not to lead ones neighbors into	79.25082397460938
5624/28840	It is exactly for that reason said Mazarin that I wish to start before	39.170955657958984
5625/28840	DArtagnan smiledhe was just the man to understand the astute	71.44279479980469
5626/28840	Mazarin saw the smile and profited by the	309.78558349609375
5627/28840	You will begin therefore by taking me first out of Paris will you not my dear	114.31365203857422
5628/28840	dArtagnan   A difficult commission my lord replied DArtagnan resuming his serious	34.50300979614258
5629/28840	But said Mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and	42.59762191772461
5630/28840	The king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and I must give it for	56.35019302368164
5631/28840	These two men met at one point and that was cunning had they been actuated equally by courage the one would have done great things for the	130.13113403320312
5632/28840	But also said Mazarin you must understand that if I ask this service from you it is with the intention of being	68.12911224365234
5633/28840	Is it still only an intention your eminence asked DArtagn	34.918556213378906
5634/28840	Stay said Mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear DArtagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it I	61.078983306884766
5635/28840	DArtagnan spared Mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable	47.54435729980469
5636/28840	I valued it much said Mazarin giving a last look at it nevertheless I give it to you with great	103.67461395263672
5637/28840	And I my lord said DArtagnan accept it as it is	42.09989929199219
5638/28840	Come let us speak of your little	61.58198928833008
5639/28840	You wish to leave before everybody and at what hour   At ten o	40.86100769042969
5640/28840	And the queen at what time is it her wish to start   At	88.62665557861328
5641/28840	I can get you out of Paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for	93.36968994140625
5642/28840	Capital but how will you get me out of Paris   Oh as to that you must leave it to	28.373258590698242
5643/28840	I give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you	221.38290405273438
5644/28840	It seems to me however said Mazarin the safest	64.53660583496094
5645/28840	Yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the	45.59114074707031
5646/28840	Nevertheless   Or find some one else continued DArtagnan turning his	44.91334533691406
5647/28840	Oh muttered Mazarin I do believe he is going off with the diamond	95.33903503417969
5648/28840	dArtagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything   I will answer for	51.86872100830078
5649/28840	Well then let us goI must trust to	88.37025451660156
5650/28840	It is very fortunate said DArtagnan to	10.08063793182373
5651/28840	You will be here at halfpast	31.422414779663086
5652/28840	And I shall find your eminence ready   Certainly quite	72.43464660644531
5653/28840	Well then it is a settled thing and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen   For what purpose   I wish to receive her majestys commands from her own	36.7975959777832
5654/28840	She desired me to give them to	36.30491256713867
5655/28840	You really wish to see her   It is indispensable my	29.042911529541016
5656/28840	Mazarin hesitated for one instant but DArtagnan was	232.02586364746094
5657/28840	Come then said the minister I will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our	64.76256561279297
5658/28840	What has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied DArtagn	63.57014465332031
5659/28840	I never swear my lord I say yes or no and as I am a gentleman I keep my	103.81684875488281
5660/28840	Come then I see that I must trust unreservedly to	48.83799362182617
5661/28840	Believe me my lord it will be your best	108.30877685546875
5662/28840	Come said Mazarin conducting DArtagnan into the queens oratory and desiring him to wait	59.14329147338867
5663/28840	He did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala	104.190673828125
5664/28840	Thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirtyfive years of	167.94406127929688
5665/28840	It is you Monsieur DArtagnan she said smiling graciously I thank you for having insisted on seeing	36.782142639160156
5666/28840	I ought to ask your majestys pardon but I wished to receive your commands from your own	31.72563934326172
5667/28840	Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you   With	55.57137680053711
5668/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan continued the queen I know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but I swear to you that I shall not forget this second service as I forgot the	30.949161529541016
5669/28840	Your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and I know not what you mean said DArtagnan b	33.162391662597656
5670/28840	Go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at	96.022705078125
5671/28840	And DArtagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet sl	37.9465446472168
5672/28840	Good thought he Mazarin has been listening to discover whether I betrayed	99.48411560058594
5673/28840	In truth that Italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest	110.4867935180664
5674/28840	DArtagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at halfpast nine oclock he entered the anter	17.411415100097656
5675/28840	He found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled	61.31730651855469
5676/28840	And that worthy Monsieur du Vallon are we not to enjoy his society   Certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the Palais	22.597776412963867
5677/28840	And we start in his carriage then   Yes my	30.911272048950195
5678/28840	And with us no other escort but you two   Is it not enough One of us would	97.95399475097656
5679/28840	Really my dear Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles	26.44684600830078
5680/28840	I should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with	72.37492370605469
5681/28840	And Bernouindo I not take him with me   There is no room for him he will rejoin your em	49.232933044433594
5682/28840	Let us go said Mazarin since everything must be done as you	65.50444030761719
5683/28840	My lord there is time to draw back said DArtagnan and your eminence is perfectly	37.38926315307617
5684/28840	Not at all not at all said Mazarin let us be	38.399139404296875
5685/28840	And so they descended the private stair Mazarin leaning on the arm of DArtagnan a hand the musketeer felt	60.91874313354492
5686/28840	At last after crossing the courts of the Palais Royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little	108.980224609375
5687/28840	Mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the key	116.06582641601562
5688/28840	Give it to me said DArtagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that	80.01717376708984
5689/28840	The steps were already down and the door	118.08050537109375
5690/28840	Mousqueton stood at the door and Porthos was inside the	49.09964370727539
5691/28840	Mount my lord said DArtagnan to Mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second	22.386146545410156
5692/28840	DArtagnan followed him and Mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many gro	34.4078369140625
5693/28840	The carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a	146.49508666992188
5694/28840	The cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around	33.495086669921875
5695/28840	On his left was Porthos whilst DArtagnan was on his right each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either	50.900352478027344
5696/28840	Before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistolsone in front of Porthos and the other of DArtagn	39.06595993041992
5697/28840	About a hundred paces from the Palais Royal a patrol stopped the	33.21847915649414
5698/28840	Mazarin replied DArtagnan bursting into a	274.109130859375
5699/28840	But the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an impr	110.74461364746094
5700/28840	A good journey to ye they cried allowing it to	355.07421875
5701/28840	Hem said DArtagnan what does my lord think of that reply   Man of talent cried Maz	74.7872314453125
5702/28840	In truth said Porthos I understand but now   About the middle of the Rue des Petits Champs they were stopped by a second	35.82075500488281
5703/28840	Who goes there inquired the captain of the	159.94241333007812
5704/28840	And Mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between	145.43727111816406
5705/28840	Who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst DArtagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses	68.84442138671875
5706/28840	But putting his head out of the carriage   Eh Planchet said	29.374345779418945
5707/28840	The chief approached and it was indeed Planchet DArtagnan had recognized the voice of his old	37.12935256958008
5708/28840	How sir said Planchet is it you   Eh mon Dieu yes my good friend this worthy Porthos has just received a sword wound and I am taking him to his country house at Saint	43.09552764892578
5709/28840	Porthos said DArtagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear Porthos to this good Planc	29.530303955078125
5710/28840	Planchet my friend said Porthos in a melancholy voice I am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to	45.638423919677734
5711/28840	Oh good Heaven said Planchet what a misfortune and how did it happen   I will tell you all about it replied Mousqu	24.66869354248047
5712/28840	Make way for us Planchet said DArtagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my	44.331146240234375
5713/28840	Planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says In that case things look	44.04167938232422
5714/28840	Then he exclaimed turning to his men   Let them pass they are	59.46101760864258
5715/28840	The carriage resumed its course and Mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe	154.2489013671875

5719/28840	A man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his	63.99371337890625

5722/28840	What is to be done said Porth	12.89015007019043
5723/28840	Not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or I will hamstring your	70.60281372070312
5724/28840	Peste said Porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles	29.050466537475586
5725/28840	I will pay you two hundred for them said Maz	52.622467041015625
5726/28840	Yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung	427.9062805175781
5727/28840	If one of them comes to my side asked Porthos must I kill him   Yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extrem	53.71913146972656
5728/28840	Come and open then cried DArtagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the	71.83080291748047
5729/28840	And as the man approached DArtagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a	37.451316833496094
5730/28840	Without doubt he recognized DArtagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his	77.19152069091797
5731/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan he cried falling back a step it is Monsieur dArtagnan let him	19.396223068237305
5732/28840	DArtagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was	60.95733642578125
5733/28840	The noise was caused by Porthos who had just knocked down his	70.26490783691406
5734/28840	DArtagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces	34.32033157348633
5735/28840	There was a moments silence then the carriage cleared the	116.28470611572266
5736/28840	To Cours la Reine cried DArtagnan to the coachman then turning to Mazarin he said Now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to Heaven for your deliver	49.456451416015625
5737/28840	Mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a	163.98301696777344
5738/28840	Five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached Cours la Re	53.29765319824219
5739/28840	Is my lord pleased with his escort asked DArtagn	40.873409271240234
5740/28840	Enchanted monsieur said Mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows and now do as much for the	34.32320785522461
5741/28840	It will not be so difficult replied DArtagnan springing to the	21.158527374267578
5742/28840	Monsieur du Vallon I commend his eminence to your	31.930063247680664
5743/28840	Be quite at ease said Porthos holding out his hand which DArtagnan took and shook in	25.56494140625
5744/28840	Oh cried Porthos as if in	40.74360656738281
5745/28840	DArtagnan looked with surprise at his	25.147659301757812
5746/28840	What is the matter then he	38.672122955322266
5747/28840	I think I have sprained my wrist said Porth	31.803529739379883
5748/28840	The devil why you strike like a blind or a deaf	293.2212219238281
5749/28840	It was necessary my man was going to fire a pistol at me but youhow did you get rid of yours   Oh mine replied DArtagnan was not a	46.71086120605469
5750/28840	What was it then   It was an appar	25.757095336914062
5751/28840	And   I charmed it	37.73763656616211
5752/28840	Instead of returning then by the Saint Honore gate DArtagnan who had time before him walked around and reentered by the Porte Richel	34.13457107543945
5753/28840	He was struck by a sudden	59.900779724121094
5754/28840	Ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair	264.04486083984375
5755/28840	And approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his	57.20762252807617
5756/28840	This scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound	164.32846069335938
5757/28840	It is in truth monsieur le coadjuteurs carriage said DArtagnan upon my honor I begin to think that Heaven favors	35.209266662597656
5758/28840	He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachmans little	89.66136169433594
5759/28840	To the Palais Royal he called	19.512453079223633
5760/28840	The coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his	95.13508605957031
5761/28840	The porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the	66.62989807128906
5762/28840	It was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the	35.47304153442383
5763/28840	Pronounce one single word muttered DArtagnan and you are a dead	52.26683044433594
5764/28840	The coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously	72.95272064208984
5765/28840	Two musketeers were pacing the court to whom DArtagnan called by their	33.3722038269043
5766/28840	The musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order	86.2825927734375
5767/28840	Then turning toward the second musketeer DArtagnan said   Monsieur du Verger help me to place this man in a place of	26.30390739440918
5768/28840	The musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was	96.04203796386719
5769/28840	DArtagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered Mazarins anter	33.142486572265625
5770/28840	Bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his	149.52732849121094
5771/28840	Everything goes on capitally my dear Monsieur Bernouin but here is a man whom I must beg you to put in a safe	32.231510162353516
5772/28840	Where then sir   Where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be	174.43186950683594
5773/28840	We have that sir replied Bernouin and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a	72.9301528930664
5774/28840	And now my good friend said DArtagnan to him I must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and	32.67316818237305
5775/28840	The coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man DArtagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the val	43.07756805419922
5776/28840	And now Monsieur du Verger he said shut yourself up with this man until Monsieur Bernouin returns to open the	44.18068313598633
5777/28840	The duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing I know but added he seriously you understand it is on the kings	97.23847961425781
5778/28840	At your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious	56.32529067993164
5779/28840	Bythebye continued DArtagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his	91.94711303710938
5780/28840	The musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and DArtagnan went out followed by Bernou	37.16818618774414
5781/28840	Lead me into the queens oratory said DArtagnan announce to her I am here and put this parcel with a wellloaded musket under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private	44.59977340698242
5782/28840	Bernouin conducted DArtagnan to the oratory where he sat down pensive	39.03508758544922
5783/28840	Everything had gone on as usual at the Palais	26.002513885498047
5784/28840	As we said before by ten oclock almost all the guests had dispersed those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve oclock to one at Cours la Re	61.3298225402832
5785/28840	At ten oclock Anne of Austria had entered the kings	26.200719833374023
5786/28840	Monsieur had just retired and the youthful Louis remaining the last was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle a game which delighted him	194.92501831054688
5787/28840	Two royal pages were playing with	325.6739807128906
5788/28840	Laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to	49.46052932739258
5789/28840	The king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was	211.78958129882812

5794/28840	Laporte said Anne of Austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress	79.40099334716797
5795/28840	The king went out accompanied by the Chevalier de Coislin bearing the candlestick and then the queen returned to her own	45.38127136230469
5796/28840	When the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her	175.0882110595703
5797/28840	Madame de Motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress	122.11661529541016
5798/28840	The queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed	86.34251403808594
5799/28840	It was at this moment DArtagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutors carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladiesinwaiting drove out and the gates were shut after	47.43058395385742
5800/28840	A few minutes after twelve oclock Bernouin knocked at the queens bedroom door having come by the cardinals secret	77.98587799072266
5801/28840	Anne of Austria opened the door to him	90.98190307617188

5812/28840	The bedclothes were thrown back exposing the kings bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be	171.82421875
5813/28840	It was one of the results of Mazarins niggard	52.707923889160156
5814/28840	The queen entered and DArtagnan remained at the	31.286100387573242
5815/28840	As soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from Laporte and ran to meet	64.66271209716797

5820/28840	The young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer the latter bent on his knee and kissed	56.85672378540039
5821/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan repeated Louis very well mad	25.118080139160156
5822/28840	At this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were	111.2686996459961
5823/28840	Oh oh replied DArtagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in	64.74897766113281

5831/28840	The tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the Palais Royal	103.1800537109375
5832/28840	Cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the	60.382076263427734
5833/28840	It was evident that there was clamor and sed	105.33647918701172
5834/28840	The king half dressed the queen and Laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and	78.7448501586914
5835/28840	Comminges who was on guard that night at the Palais Royal ran	72.53868865966797

5838/28840	DArtagnan saw from the expression of the queens face that she was about to issue some violent	42.7093620300293
5839/28840	He approached her and said in a low voice   Has your majesty still confidence in me   This voice startled	59.35306167602539

5843/28840	Comminges glanced at DArtagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring	118.6656723022461
5844/28840	DArtagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious	42.930580139160156

5859/28840	turned around astonished that any one should dare to address	286.37042236328125
5860/28840	But the queen pressed the childs	70.2892074584961
5861/28840	Does your majesty remember when playing in the park of Fontainebleau or in the palace courts at Versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder   Yes	84.94019317626953

5872/28840	Not at all said DArtagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be	60.10377502441406
5873/28840	You are right sir always right said Anne of	60.370243072509766
5874/28840	Laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the	76.98380279541016
5875/28840	The queen bent over him and kissed his	220.7243194580078
5876/28840	Yes said the king but I do not wish to be touched by any of those	25.017505645751953
5877/28840	Sire I am here said DArtagnan and I give you my word that if a single man has the audacity his life shall pay for	43.66822052001953
5878/28840	And now what is to be done asked the queen for I hear	47.905670166015625
5879/28840	Monsieur Laporte go to them and again recommend	99.13633728027344
5880/28840	Madame wait at the door whilst I shall be at the head of the kings bed ready to die for	54.840152740478516
5881/28840	Laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst DArtagnan glided behind the	57.22945022583008
5882/28840	Then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her	79.89737701416016
5883/28840	On seeing the queen the men stopped short	336.78369140625
5884/28840	There was then amongst that crowd a moments hesitation which looked like	312.7651062011719
5885/28840	They had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the	151.0174560546875
5886/28840	The gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bedhead but his	183.15379333496094
5887/28840	The foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall	110.93673706054688
5888/28840	Enter gentlemen said Laporte since the queen desires you so to	80.14348602294922
5889/28840	Then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tipt	86.53247833251953
5890/28840	This example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted court	166.90525817871094
5891/28840	Far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and	89.85429382324219
5892/28840	DArtagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized Planc	54.44968032836914
5893/28840	Sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore I determined to show him to you	44.43327713012695
5894/28840	Approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run	100.46044158935547
5895/28840	No certainly replied Planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon	124.4590835571289
5896/28840	You will say then to my good and faithful Parisians continued Anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive DArtagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to	55.17763137817383
5897/28840	I shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but   But what asked Anne of	38.895938873291016
5898/28840	Will your majesty pardon me said Planchet but is it really the king who is lying there   Anne of Austria	45.28317642211914
5899/28840	If she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying	108.73595428466797
5900/28840	A man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and	73.53387451171875
5901/28840	For one second DArtagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and DArtagnan recognized the coadj	35.194522857666016
5902/28840	It is certainly the king said the man rising	91.67681884765625
5903/28840	God bless his majesty   Yes repeated the leader in a whisper God bless his majesty and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their	99.49783325195312
5904/28840	Now said Planchet let us thank the	44.368682861328125
5905/28840	They all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had	63.37118148803711
5906/28840	Planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to	34.60322952270508
5907/28840	What is your name my friend she	61.517887115478516
5908/28840	Planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned	225.36917114257812
5909/28840	Yes continued the queen I think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and I wish to know your	43.324153900146484
5910/28840	Yes thought Planchet to treat me as a	80.32269287109375
5911/28840	DArtagnan trembled lest Planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell his name and that the queen knowing his name would discover that Planchet had belonged to	43.44890594482422
5912/28840	Madame replied Planchet respectfully I am called Dulaurier at your	43.683040618896484
5913/28840	Thank you Monsieur Dulaurier said the queen and what is your business   Madame I am a clothier in the Rue Bourdonna	45.097557067871094
5914/28840	That is all I wished to know said the	37.553775787353516
5915/28840	Come come thought DArtagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool it is evident he has been brought up in a good	44.85505294799805
5916/28840	DArtagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying Let us	48.09793472290039
5917/28840	Well asked the queen   Well madame replied the valet I followed them as far as the	23.38885498046875
5918/28840	They announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and	54.56061935424805
5919/28840	Oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is I who promise	89.46601104736328
5920/28840	Then turning to DArtagnan she said   Sir you have given me this evening the best advice I have ever	32.027278900146484
5921/28840	Continue and say what we must do	75.92157745361328
5922/28840	Monsieur Laporte said DArtagnan finish dressing his	32.04543685913086
5923/28840	We may go then asked the	58.127769470214844
5924/28840	You have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the	41.607601165771484
5925/28840	Go sir said the queen I will follow	22.60047149658203
5926/28840	DArtagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the	23.192476272583008
5927/28840	DArtagnan took out the parcel which he had desired Bernouin to place under the	43.2421989440918
5928/28840	It may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to Monsieur de Gondys coach	33.72525405883789
5929/28840	He placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the	49.99995422363281
5930/28840	Sir said DArtagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coach	24.67245101928711
5931/28840	If when you arrive at Cours la Reine you find no one you must go on to Saint Germ	34.705162048339844
5932/28840	The musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus	144.3131866455078
5933/28840	DArtagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind	62.4153938293457
5934/28840	The queen appeared and was followed by the king and the Duke dAnjou his	156.3974609375
5935/28840	Monsieur the coadjutors carriage she exclaimed falling	45.114418029785156
5936/28840	Yes madame said DArtagnan but get in fearlessly for I myself will drive	37.80436706542969
5937/28840	The queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage and the king and monsieur took their places at her	30.03847885131836
5938/28840	How madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties   It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the kings	33.89960479736328
5939/28840	But will that not excite suspicion sir asked the	60.986961364746094
5940/28840	Your majestys mind may be quite at ease replied the officer I have my answer	86.49237823486328
5941/28840	The blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the Rue Richel	49.128787994384766
5942/28840	On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his	79.249267578125
5943/28840	DArtagnan signed to them to draw	38.70527267456055
5944/28840	Do you recognize the carriage he asked the	86.72869110107422
5945/28840	The sergeant put the lantern near the	609.1758422851562
5946/28840	They are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he	8.970836639404297
5947/28840	Hush he is enjoying a ride with Madame de Guemen	86.1693115234375
5948/28840	I know who it is Then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said   I wish you joy my lord   Impudent fellow cried DArtagnan you will get me turned	48.442501068115234
5949/28840	The gate groaned on its hinges and DArtagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the	73.23992919921875
5950/28840	Mousqueton exclaimed DArtagnan draw up the blinds of his majestys	32.34294128417969
5951/28840	And driving the coadjutors carriage said the	51.237003326416016
5952/28840	Corpo di Dio Monsieur dArtagnan said Mazarin you are worth your weight in	99.38729858398438
5953/28840	How DArtagnan and Porthos earned by selling	15.46631908416748
5954/28840	Mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for Saint Germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet	78.9260025024414
5955/28840	However she offered the cardinal Laportes place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the	121.637451171875
5956/28840	It was not without foundation that a report of the kings intention to leave Paris by night had been	80.92788696289062
5957/28840	Ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six oclock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being	141.5109100341797
5958/28840	The first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the Prince de Condé with the princess and dowager	96.52718353271484
5959/28840	Both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was	49.72001647949219
5960/28840	The second contained the Duke and Duchess of Orleans the tall young Mademoiselle and the Abbé de la Riviere and the third the Duke de Longueville and the Prince de Conti brother and brotherinlaw of Cond	49.13726043701172
5961/28840	They all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their	36.15662384033203
5962/28840	The queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said   But where is Madame de Longueville   Ah yes where is my sister asked the	39.71778869628906
5963/28840	Madame de Longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your	37.351078033447266
5964/28840	Anne gave a quick glance to Mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his	45.64976501464844
5965/28840	What do you say of this asked the	33.61590576171875
5966/28840	I say that she is a hostage for the Parisians answered the	38.102577209472656
5967/28840	Why is she not come asked the prince in a low voice addressing his	89.38878631591797
5968/28840	Silence whispered the duke she has her	207.86788940429688
5969/28840	She will ruin us returned the	169.47027587890625
5970/28840	Carriages now arrived in crowds those of the Marechal de Villeroy Guitant Villequier and Comminges came into the	48.36705780029297
5971/28840	The two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of DArtagnan and Porthos in their	20.872928619384766
5972/28840	These two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing DArtagnan on the coachbox of the royal	64.46976470947266
5973/28840	Mousqueton took the place of the coachman and drove standing for reasons known to himself like Automedon of	110.00357818603516
5974/28840	The queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the Gascons eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the	113.71871185302734
5975/28840	Let us be the avant guard said he to Porthos and find good quarters at Saint Germain nobody will think of us and for my part I am greatly fatig	70.31371307373047
5976/28840	As for me replied Porthos I am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting truly the Parisians are	79.98924255371094
5977/28840	Or rather we are very clever said DArtagn	29.063400268554688
5978/28840	The queens voice she is speaking said Porthos I think she wants to ride on horse	87.21931457519531
5979/28840	Oh she would like it but   But what   The cardinal wont allow	71.95439147949219

5981/28840	DArtagnan started off for Saint Germain followed by Porth	16.44486427307129
5982/28840	We will go on gentlemen said the	95.87808227539062
5983/28840	And the royal carriage drove on followed by the other coaches and about fifty horse	102.7232666015625
5984/28840	They reached Saint German without any accident on descending the queen found the prince awaiting her bareheaded to offer her his	180.760009765625
5985/28840	What an awakening for the Parisians said the queen	82.7008056640625
5986/28840	Well then let it be war Have we not on our side the conqueror of Rocroy of Nordlingen of Lens   The prince bowed	90.83954620361328
5987/28840	It was then three oclock in the	14.876472473144531
5988/28840	The queen walked first every one followed	862.4078979492188
5989/28840	About two hundred persons had accompanied her in her	128.1545867919922
5990/28840	Am Iam I then to sleep on the floor asked Gaston dOrleans with a forced	114.80982971191406

5993/28840	Gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to rep	92.15099334716797
5994/28840	Well for my part I shall go to bed said DArtagnan come Porth	17.292020797729492
5995/28840	Porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his	135.72039794921875
5996/28840	They walked from one end of the chateau to the other Porthos looking with wondering eyes at DArtagnan who was counting on his	33.96712875366211
5997/28840	Four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pist	107.7844009399414
5998/28840	Yes interposed Porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pistoles   A pistole is not enough said DArtagnan tis worth a lou	23.1661376953125
5999/28840	What is worth a louis   Four hundred at a louis each make four hundred lou	66.62427520751953
6000/28840	Yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four	132.0595703125
6001/28840	But four hundred what   Listen cried DArtagn	24.53751564025879
6002/28840	But as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friends	44.21558380126953
6003/28840	Isnt Mousqueton there   But he wears my livery my livery will be known replied Porth	54.72270965576172
6004/28840	He can turn his coat inside	264.3853759765625
6005/28840	You are always in the right my dear friend cried Porthos but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice   DArtagnan	37.6461181640625
6006/28840	The two friends turned down the first street they came	71.23006439208984
6007/28840	Porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst DArtagnan knocked at the door of a house to the	26.375410079956055
6008/28840	Sir we dont keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but please ask at the hay	117.95466613769531
6009/28840	Where is the hay dealers   At the last large door in the	57.72444534301758
6010/28840	Are there any other people in Saint Germain who sell straw   Yes theres the landlord of the Lamb and GrosLouis the farmer they both live in the Rue des Ursul	86.64800262451172
6011/28840	DArtagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles	55.086299896240234
6012/28840	He went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same	83.9900131225586
6013/28840	Finally Farmer Louis sold them eighty trusses making in all four hundred and	347.3621826171875
6014/28840	There was no more to be had in Saint Germ	40.321983337402344
6015/28840	This foraging did not occupy more than half an	60.18241500854492
6016/28840	Mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new	168.3621368408203
6017/28840	He was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty lou	66.4013442993164
6018/28840	DArtagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the Duke of Orleans on their camp	47.69227600097656
6019/28840	Straw they all cried out straw where is there any to be found   I can show you answered the Gas	110.1009292602539
6020/28840	And he conducted them to Mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis	45.75862121582031
6021/28840	At five oclock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be	30.780534744262695
6022/28840	DArtagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own	40.438148498535156
6023/28840	Mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him	43.24170684814453
6024/28840	DArtagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with Porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen lou	40.60710144042969
6025/28840	Porthos however found that he had no straw left for	122.53759002685547
6026/28840	He returned to Mousqueton but the steward had sold the last w	48.18853759765625
6027/28840	DArtagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for Porthos but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it he consented that Porthos should share his couch with	62.27973937988281

6037/28840	And the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst Porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set	87.78843688964844
6038/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him I have not forgotten with what zeal you have served	23.0411434173584

6062/28840	The officer went off with an eagerness that showed the Gascon that he had some personal interest in the	70.61056518554688

6069/28840	In which we hear Tidings of Aram	123.04029846191406
6070/28840	DArtagnan went straight to the stables day was just dawn	51.007415771484375
6071/28840	He found his horse and that of Porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty man	74.8351821899414
6072/28840	He took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable where he saw a little straw but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body which uttered a cry and arose on its knees rubbing its	97.44805145263672
6073/28840	It was Mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the	103.59416198730469
6074/28840	Mousqueton cried DArtagnan let us be off Let us set	28.540626525878906

6077/28840	Mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over	220.9220733642578
6078/28840	Whilst this went on Porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and Mousqueton almost	113.93011474609375

6083/28840	And they both set out for	88.13241577148438
6084/28840	On arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the	129.3751983642578

6091/28840	The people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked DArtagnan with an eloquent	66.9416732788086
6092/28840	And they continued their way crossing the barricades getting the chains about their legs pushed about questioning and	408.98895263671875
6093/28840	In the place of the Palais Royal DArtagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred	38.82059860229492

6106/28840	Ah said Porthos let us hear what he	13.936911582946777

6111/28840	I believe by Heaven said DArtagnan that I shall embrace him since hes upon our road and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear Athos from that very day he becomes my	57.67522430419922
6112/28840	And I said Porthos shall make him my sole	42.304344177246094
6113/28840	Let us see what more does Athos say   Should you meet on your journey a certain Monsieur Mordaunt distrust him in a letter I cannot say	70.28244018554688
6114/28840	Monsieur Mordaunt tis well said Porthos we shall remember that but see there is a postscript from Aram	26.558467864990234
6115/28840	So there is said DArtagnan and he read   We conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal	69.55338287353516

6117/28840	I dare not say more in a	94.12968444824219
6118/28840	If that is all it is easily done said Porth	21.613544464111328
6119/28840	On the contrary observed DArtagnan with a vexed look it would be	39.32950210571289
6120/28840	How so   It is precisely this Monsieur Mordaunt whom we are going to join at Boulogne and with whom we cross to	23.257429122924805

6122/28840	I did think of it but this letter has neither date nor post	105.09125518798828
6123/28840	And he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabb	71.7814712524414
6124/28840	As to DArtagnan he remained standing like a man in consternation with the deepest affliction depicted on his	30.39716339111328
6125/28840	Ah this is not right Athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad	106.86521911621094
6126/28840	Mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the	93.19451904296875
6127/28840	Come said DArtagnan all this leads to	33.83549118041992

6131/28840	On arriving at the Rue Saint Denis the friends found a vast concourse of	141.1591796875
6132/28840	It was the Duc de Beaufort who was coming from the Vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the Parisians intoxicated with	32.40015411376953
6133/28840	With the dukes aid they already considered themselves	437.15191650390625
6134/28840	The two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the Saint Denis	160.92552185058594

6183/28840	At ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black who seemed waiting for some one and who from the moment he saw them enter the town never took his eyes off	65.77499389648438
6184/28840	Yes sir he said in a softened	73.82048034667969
6185/28840	Are you not going to put up at the Arms of England   Yes	32.80511474609375
6186/28840	Are you not charged with a mission from his eminence Cardinal Mazarin   Yes	29.918615341186523
6187/28840	In that case I am the man you have to do	40.51189422607422
6188/28840	Ah thought DArtagnan the man I am warned against by Ath	34.35892868041992
6189/28840	Ah thought Porthos the man Aramis wants me to str	69.19710540771484
6190/28840	They both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inqu	152.77880859375
6191/28840	Do you doubt my word he	61.87137985229492
6192/28840	In that case I can give you	60.49305725097656
6193/28840	No sir said DArtagnan and we place ourselves at your	40.30726623535156
6194/28840	Well gentlemen resumed Mordaunt we must set out without delay today is the last day granted me by the	118.77197265625
6195/28840	My ship is ready and had you not come I must have set off without you for General Cromwell expects my return impatient	108.78941345214844
6196/28840	So thought the lieutenant tis to General Cromwell that our dispatches are	78.82227325439453
6197/28840	Have you no letter for him asked the young	41.11105728149414
6198/28840	I have one the seal of which I am not to break till I reach London but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till	71.66542053222656
6199/28840	DArtagnan tore open the envelope of the	27.662559509277344
6200/28840	It was directed to Monsieur Oliver Cromwell General of the Army of the English	42.346675872802734
6201/28840	Who is this Monsieur Oliver Cromwell inquired Porth	21.538986206054688
6202/28840	Perhaps Mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said Porth	69.0535888671875
6203/28840	Come come gentlemen said Mordaunt impatiently let us	95.5241928100586
6204/28840	What exclaimed Porthos without supper Cannot Monsieur Cromwell wait a little   Yes but I said Mord	35.957550048828125
6205/28840	Well you said Porthos what then   I cannot	34.94305419921875
6206/28840	Oh as to you that is not my concern and I shall sup either with or without your	83.29853820800781
6207/28840	The young mans eyes kindled in secret but he restrained	101.785400390625
6208/28840	Monsieur said DArtagnan you must excuse famished	21.120595932006836
6209/28840	Besides our supper cant delay you	1683.41748046875
6210/28840	We will hasten on to the inn you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the	122.04135131835938
6211/28840	We will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you	59.822540283203125
6212/28840	Just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he	226.248779296875
6213/28840	The name of your ship inquired DArtagn	35.04998016357422
6214/28840	Very well in half an hour we shall be on	36.186614990234375
6215/28840	And the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the Arms of	123.979248046875
6216/28840	What do you say of that young man asked DArtagnan as they hurried	35.6767463684082
6217/28840	I say that he doesnt suit me at all said Porthos and that I feel a strong itching to follow Aramiss	57.32878494262695
6218/28840	By no means my dear Porthos that man is a messenger of General Cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception I imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confid	65.26630401611328
6219/28840	Nevertheless said Porthos I have always noticed that Aramis gives good	46.10438537597656
6220/28840	Listen returned DArtagnan when our embassy is finished   Well   If it brings us back to France   Well   Well we shall	42.82648849487305
6221/28840	At that moment the two friends reached the hotel Arms of England where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the	77.10580444335938
6222/28840	There they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized Mordaunt walking up and down impatient	81.87247467041016
6223/28840	It is singular said DArtagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the Standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one I must have known but who it was I cannot yet	86.36029815673828
6224/28840	A few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight oclock before they raised	89.96310424804688
6225/28840	The young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be	121.62296295166016
6226/28840	Porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to	111.57738494873047
6227/28840	DArtagnan overcoming his repugnance to Mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him	57.230377197265625
6228/28840	There placed between two rivers on the borders of Scotland but still on English soil the tents of a little army	136.45803833007812
6229/28840	The moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that Charles	79.29561614990234
6230/28840	had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst Oxford and Newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some	123.9678955078125
6231/28840	About fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a Scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad Perthshire	152.646728515625
6232/28840	The former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said goodnight and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first caval	115.79656219482422
6233/28840	In the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting	147.3282928466797
6234/28840	Well my dear friend said he in as pure French as has ever been uttered between Rouen and	186.22682189941406
6235/28840	Well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know	81.5928726196289
6236/28840	Why what is the matter   It would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin	88.98617553710938
6237/28840	We must go and find Lord	116.31515502929688
6238/28840	They both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking	60.035491943359375
6239/28840	Tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of anter	40.2246208190918
6240/28840	However you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the	102.35991668701172
6241/28840	Lord Winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy	189.13088989257812
6242/28840	The two friends approached Winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his	67.0512466430664
6243/28840	He turned around recognized Athos and Aramis and held out his hand to	25.022403717041016
6244/28840	Have you observed said he to them what a bloodred color the moon has tonight   No replied Athos I thought it looked much the same as	85.18709564208984
6245/28840	I must own said Aramis I am like the Comte de la FereI can see nothing remarkable about	29.009794235229492
6246/28840	My lord said Athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the	92.80016326904297
6247/28840	Have you studied our Scotch troops and have you confidence in them   The Scotch inquired	178.97340393066406
6248/28840	What Scotch   Ours egad exclaimed Ath	160.516357421875
6249/28840	Those in whom the king has confidedLord Levens High	92.0633316040039
6250/28840	No said Winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens   Not the least in the world said Aramis and Athos at	75.728759765625
6251/28840	Tell me continued Winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in France that Henry	146.4823760986328
6252/28840	the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with	65.64617919921875
6253/28840	de Bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard   Yes said Athos and the marechal has often told me so	81.2702407836914
6254/28840	Then it was so murmured Winter and the next day Henry	61.003273010253906
6255/28840	But what has this vision of Henry	107.06189727783203
6256/28840	to do with you my lord inquired Aram	41.145084381103516
6257/28840	Nothing and indeed I am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important	100.10004425048828
6258/28840	Yes my lord said Athos I wish to speak to the	12.231557846069336
6259/28840	To the king but the king is	56.6868782043457
6260/28840	I have something important to reveal to	91.36670684814453
6261/28840	Can it not be put off till tomorrow   He must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too	68.34020233154297
6262/28840	Lord Winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the	59.99800109863281
6263/28840	This corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency Charles could communicate instantly with his faithful	229.25360107421875
6264/28840	These gentlemen are with me said	195.572265625
6265/28840	The lackey bowed and let them	89.48572540283203
6266/28840	As he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and	205.36964416503906
6267/28840	They advanced and Athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by	171.3766326904297
6268/28840	Athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he	315.33599853515625
6269/28840	Ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you Comte de la Fere   Yes sire replied Ath	14.425862312316895
6270/28840	You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news   Alas sire answered Athos your majesty has guessed ar	62.615562438964844
6271/28840	It is bad news   Yes s	28.43556022644043
6272/28840	You never come to me without conferring	365.18060302734375
6273/28840	You whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune you who are sent to me by Henrietta whatever news you bring speak	180.2467803955078
6274/28840	Sire Cromwell has arrived this night at	149.7755889892578
6275/28840	Ah exclaimed the king to fight   No sire but to buy your	45.77182388305664
6276/28840	What did you say   I said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the Scottish	39.734703063964844
6277/28840	For unpaid wages yes I know	364.31829833984375
6278/28840	For the last year my faithful Highlanders have fought for honor	212.6846160888672
6279/28840	Well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and tonight they have sold you for two hundred thousand poundsthat is to say for half what is owing	104.31574249267578
6280/28840	Impossible cried the king the Scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds And who is the Judas who has concluded this infamous bargain   Lord Le	125.80103302001953
6281/28840	Are you certain of it sir   I heard it with my own	63.35625457763672
6282/28840	The king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his	74.8417739868164
6283/28840	To cross the Tyne reach Scotland and rejoin Lord Montrose who will not sell	92.97551727294922
6284/28840	And what shall I do in Scotland A war of partisans unworthy of a	216.35801696777344
6285/28840	The example of Robert Bruce will absolve you s	132.34500122070312
6286/28840	No no I have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their	171.00204467773438
6287/28840	Sire said Athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a	104.65898132324219
6288/28840	I have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in London and I say to you Live sireit is the will of	50.16798782348633
6289/28840	I would confide my life to them but I should hesitate ere I trusted them with your majest	45.790523529052734
6290/28840	Well said Athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted	62.83866882324219

6293/28840	And yours Monsieur dHerblay   Yes s	12.088088989257812
6294/28840	Winter then left the tent in the meantime the king finished his	127.6954345703125
6295/28840	The first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as Winter reentered	146.3759002685547
6296/28840	Grimaud and Blaisois are holding your horses ready sadd	162.6577911376953
6297/28840	In that case exclaimed Athos let us not lose an instant but set	40.392337799072266
6298/28840	Sire said Aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this   Friends answered Charles sadly I have but threeone of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a weeks standing whom I shall never	81.93374633789062
6299/28840	Come gentlemen come   The king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for	71.3801040649414
6300/28840	It was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very	37.407127380371094
6301/28840	The horse neighed with pleasure at seeing	166.14068603515625
6302/28840	Ah said the king I was unjust here is a creature that loves	84.01104736328125
6303/28840	You at least will be faithful to me	68.72090148925781
6304/28840	The horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the kings face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with	186.61439514160156
6305/28840	Yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my Arthur thou art a fond and faithful	140.17579650878906
6306/28840	After this little scene Charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to Athos Aramis and Winter said   Now gentlemen I am at your	63.758697509765625
6307/28840	But Athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the Tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the	44.16263961791992
6308/28840	What is that line cried Athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demitints of day	140.36447143554688
6309/28840	What is that line I did not observe it	87.81803894042969
6310/28840	It must be the fog rising from the river said the	78.63520812988281
6311/28840	Sire it is something more opaque than the	80.18197631835938
6312/28840	Indeed said Winter it appears to me like a bar of red	97.22137451171875
6313/28840	It is the enemy who have made a sortie from Newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed Ath	123.42218780517578
6314/28840	Stop a moment does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the Ironsides   This was the name given the cuirassiers whom Cromwell had made his body	62.201236724853516
6315/28840	Ah said the king we shall soon see whether my Highlanders have betrayed me or	66.8121109008789
6316/28840	What are you going to do exclaimed Ath	23.636417388916016
6317/28840	To give them the order to charge and run down these miserable	325.5713195800781
6318/28840	And the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of Lord Le	71.2769775390625
6319/28840	Is the king wounded cried Lord	215.60311889648438
6320/28840	I see spots of blood on the	90.83529663085938
6321/28840	And he set off to follow the two	65.83831787109375
6322/28840	Go and call out your regiment said he I can foresee that we shall have need of it	95.17147827148438
6323/28840	Winter turned his horse and the two friends rode	43.2876091003418
6324/28840	It had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the Scottish commander he dismounted and	92.21640014648438
6325/28840	The general was there surrounded by the more prominent	169.25062561035156

6330/28840	Of this treaty at least I have been	104.93992614746094
6331/28840	This is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for I stand here to accuse	233.01797485351562
6332/28840	Sire said Lord Leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false	68.58026885986328
6333/28840	My own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and Scotland and I can almost say that with my own ears I have heard the clauses of the treaty	121.59025573730469
6334/28840	The Scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brow	72.8170394897461
6335/28840	Sire murmured Lord Leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our	63.40107345581055
6336/28840	I ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the	103.2420654296875
6337/28840	That cannot be sire said the ear	248.74363708496094
6338/28840	How cannot be What hinders it exclaimed the	162.055419921875
6339/28840	Your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the English	53.21287155151367
6340/28840	And if there is a truce the English army has broken it by quitting the town contrary to the agreement which kept it	181.83119201660156
6341/28840	Yes said they we have promised to deliver Scotland and England from him who for the last fiveandtwenty years has sucked the blood and gold of Scotland and	86.38723754882812
6342/28840	We have promised and we will keep our	92.8628921508789
6343/28840	And both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other	97.73670959472656
6344/28840	Aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and Athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his	49.8686637878418
6345/28840	On their road they perceived Lord Winter marching at the head of his	104.17830657958984
6346/28840	The king motioned him to accompany	118.18167114257812
6347/28840	They all four entered the tent they had no plan readythey must think of	250.96151733398438
6348/28840	The king threw himself into an arm	57.47519302368164
6349/28840	Betrayed yes betrayed by the Scotch amongst whom I was born whom I have always loved better than the	149.53067016601562
6350/28840	Oh traitors that ye are   Sire said Athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a	41.82918167114258
6351/28840	Up sire up for you have here at least three men who will not betray	73.8832015991211
6352/28840	Ah if we had been five murmured Athos thinking of DArtagnan and Porth	17.997455596923828
6353/28840	What do you say inquired Charles	188.62518310546875
6354/28840	I say sire that there is now but one way	79.85574340820312
6355/28840	Let one of us put on the dress and mount the kings	124.14920043945312
6356/28840	Whilst they pursue him the king might	356.7916259765625
6357/28840	It is good advice said Athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to	52.3250846862793
6358/28840	What do you think of this counsel Winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed	84.950439453125
6359/28840	I think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by Monsieur dHerbl	26.982240676879883
6360/28840	I humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to	83.23235321044922
6361/28840	But if I accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my	95.06633758544922
6362/28840	He will have had the glory of having saved his king cried	193.63583374023438
6363/28840	It is right said Athos he has served your majesty longer than we	71.08589172363281
6364/28840	The king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his	92.23812103271484
6365/28840	Wait a moment sir said he I have an order for each of you	70.76615142822266
6366/28840	He turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the Order of the G	73.89859771728516
6367/28840	These cannot be for us said Ath	56.60287857055664
6368/28840	Such are for royalty and we are simple common	288.373779296875
6369/28840	I shall not find amongst them such great hearts as	210.27333068847656
6370/28840	No no you do yourselves injustice but I am here to do you	84.1629638671875
6371/28840	Athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula I make you a	103.77393341064453
6372/28840	Be brave faithful and loyal he said You are brave faithful and	257.68658447265625
6373/28840	Then turning to Aramis he said   It is now your turn monsieur le cheval	13.598183631896973
6374/28840	The same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst Winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the	113.2972412109375
6375/28840	Charles having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos embraced them	166.66969299316406
6376/28840	Sire said Winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are	178.2476043701172
6377/28840	The king looked at the three	84.16409301757812
6378/28840	Flying through an army sire said Athos in all countries in the world is called	40.91944122314453
6379/28840	Then I shall die sword in hand said	192.3933563232422
6380/28840	Monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever I am king   Sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our	45.62147521972656
6381/28840	The king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with Winter and went	483.93292236328125
6382/28840	Winters regiment was ranged on some high ground above the	343.07965087890625
6383/28840	The king followed by the three friends turned his steps that	114.88146209716797
6384/28840	The Scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle	123.91683959960938
6385/28840	Do you see that said the	35.194881439208984
6386/28840	Perhaps they are penitent and preparing to	147.46507263183594
6387/28840	If they are penitent said Athos let them follow	58.10083770751953
6388/28840	Well said the king what shall we do   Let us examine the enemys	28.53078269958496
6389/28840	At the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of	92.84048461914062
6390/28840	The air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the	174.94158935546875
6391/28840	The regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly	156.37979125976562
6392/28840	On the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by	164.99317932128906
6393/28840	He turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king	106.71825408935547
6394/28840	Does this man know your majesty personally inquired Aram	101.04266357421875
6395/28840	Then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the	158.77296447753906
6396/28840	Ah said Athos how much time we have	43.77240753173828
6397/28840	Now said the king give the word and let us	66.76618194580078
6398/28840	Will you not give it sire asked Ath	56.35702133178711
6399/28840	No I make you my lieutenantgeneral said the	79.76813507080078
6400/28840	What we are going to say does not concern your	25.10147476196289
6401/28840	The king smiling turned a few steps	458.23089599609375
6402/28840	This is what I propose to do said Ath	25.694252014160156
6403/28840	We will divide our regiments into two squad	125.74981689453125
6404/28840	You will put yourself at the head of the	32.70777893066406
6405/28840	We and his majesty will lead the	97.86314392089844
6406/28840	Once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep as long as you and your regiment do your duty we will look to the	106.44275665283203
6407/28840	To horse reechoed Athos everything is arranged and	201.7648162841797
6408/28840	Now gentlemen cried the king forward and rally to the old cry of France Montjoy and	194.6392364501953
6409/28840	Denis The war cry of England is too often in the mouths of tra	176.9869384765625
6410/28840	They mountedthe king on Winters horse and Winter on that of the king then Winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with Athos on his right and Aramis on his left at the head of the	48.085025787353516
6411/28840	The Scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these	219.586669921875
6412/28840	Some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in	64.38924407958984
6413/28840	There said the king that consoles me they are not all tra	68.15159606933594
6414/28840	At this moment Winters voice was raised with the cry of Forward   The first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the	89.01860046386719
6415/28840	A regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward	186.39810180664062
6416/28840	Sire said Athos we foresaw this and if Lord Winters men but do their duty we are saved instead of	98.10562896728516
6417/28840	At this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses Winters voice crying out   Sword in hand   At these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like	87.79170227050781
6418/28840	Now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand   But Aramis and Athos were the only ones to obey this command and the kings	88.37501525878906
6419/28840	We are betrayed said the king in a low	37.924530029296875
6420/28840	Wait a moment said Athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and await the order of their	37.80060958862305
6421/28840	Have they not heard that of their colonel But look look cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of Athoss	91.6762466430664
6422/28840	Ah cowards traitors screamed Lord Winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the	264.10125732421875
6423/28840	About fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of Cromwells cuirass	56.0354118347168
6424/28840	Let us go and die with them said the	57.3632926940918
6425/28840	Let us go said Athos and Aram	14.66891860961914
6426/28840	All faithful hearts with me cried out	417.5201416015625
6427/28840	This voice was heard by the two friends who set off full gall	35.635047912597656
6428/28840	No quarter cried a voice in French answering to that of Winter which made them trem	255.79977416992188
6429/28840	As for Winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were pet	74.80899047851562
6430/28840	It was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the English regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in	51.05963897705078
6431/28840	Tis he murmured Winter his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his	62.19085693359375
6432/28840	The king the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of Winter take him	193.27378845214844
6433/28840	No it is not the king exclaimed the caval	34.63014221191406
6434/28840	Lord Winter you are not the king you are my	68.38072204589844
6435/28840	Wretch exclaimed Aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go	96.98356628417969
6436/28840	At this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two French	67.73735046386719
6437/28840	Athos after making sure that Lord Winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said   Come Aramis now for the honor of France and the two Englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally	97.58956146240234
6438/28840	At the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their	103.54818725585938
6439/28840	DArt exclaimed Athos whilst the Gascon covered his mouth with his	51.66035842895508
6440/28840	I am your prisoner said Aramis giving up his sword to Porth	28.934974670410156
6441/28840	Fire fire cried Mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two	124.60415649414062
6442/28840	And wherefore fire said the colonel every one has	230.37222290039062
6443/28840	It is the son of Milady said Athos to DArtagn	12.516351699829102
6444/28840	It is the monk whispered Porthos to Aram	31.815391540527344
6445/28840	And now the ranks began to	345.3179931640625
6446/28840	DArtagnan held the bridle of Athoss horse and Porthos that of Aram	19.39594078063965
6447/28840	Both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the	182.79356384277344
6448/28840	This movement revealed the spot where Winters body had	200.1018829345703
6449/28840	Mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant	153.91152954101562
6450/28840	Athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet	372.04754638671875
6451/28840	We are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize	224.2213897705078
6452/28840	Then turning to the young man he exclaimed   A fine prize a fine prize friend Mordaunt we have both myself and Monsieur du Vallon taken two Knights of the Garter nothing	50.5040168762207
6453/28840	But said Mordaunt looking at Athos and Aramis with bloodshot eyes these are Frenchmen I	39.05472946166992
6454/28840	Are you French sir said he to Ath	59.73625564575195
6455/28840	Very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow country	87.20620727539062
6456/28840	But the kingwhere is the king exclaimed Athos anx	69.40068817138672
6457/28840	DArtagnan vigorously seized his prisoners hand saying   Eh the king We have secured	87.7425308227539
6458/28840	Yes said Aramis through an infamous act of	121.4683837890625
6459/28840	The king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty	343.15130615234375
6460/28840	He appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty	113.74740600585938
6461/28840	Drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from	70.5689926147461
6462/28840	Behold Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old Puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the	115.00631713867188
6463/28840	Do you call him Nebuchadnezzar said Mordaunt with a terrible smile no it is Charles the First the king the good King Charles who despoils his subjects to enrich	113.52246856689453
6464/28840	Charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize	86.1716537475586
6465/28840	Nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed Mord	130.09185791015625
6466/28840	Bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by DArtagnan and Porth	27.03728485107422
6467/28840	The day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank God But where is my old friend Winter   The two gentlemen turned away their heads in	72.10490417480469
6468/28840	The demon had known how to wound	694.3103637695312
6469/28840	The remembrance of Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and	116.89469146728516
6470/28840	He saw a corpse at his	116.3663558959961
6471/28840	He uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised Winters head and unfastening the Order of the Saint Esprit placed it on his own	59.7205924987793
6472/28840	Lord Winter is killed then inquired DArtagnan fixing his eyes on the	47.61825180053711
6473/28840	Yes said Athos by his own	49.11140823364258
6474/28840	Come he was the first of us to go peace be to him he was an honest man said DArtagn	45.3697624206543
6475/28840	Charles Stuart said the colonel of the English regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner   Colonel Tomlison said Charles kings cannot yield the man alone submits to	133.81556701660156
6476/28840	The king drew his sword and broke it on his	70.31163787841797
6477/28840	At this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure it was	135.7384033203125
6478/28840	The king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the	114.85040283203125
6479/28840	Now gentlemen said he conduct me where you	111.44859313964844
6480/28840	Turning back again he said I thought I saw Winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon	168.78277587890625
6481/28840	Never fear King Charles said Mordaunt the bullet pierced his	209.8067169189453
6482/28840	Do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or Porthos said DArtagnan to Athos and Aramis that you recognize this man for Milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this	46.238033294677734
6483/28840	The detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aidedecamp from Cromwell sent orders that Colonel Tomlison should conduct him to Holdenby	274.1815490722656
6484/28840	At the same time couriers started in every direction over England and Europe to announce that Charles Stuart was the prisoner of Oliver Crom	63.6618766784668
6485/28840	Have you been to the general said Mordaunt to DArtagnan and Porthos you know he sent for you after the	28.68170166015625
6486/28840	We want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied DArtagn	56.46323776245117
6487/28840	Do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds   Oh be assured said Mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well I promise	86.01643371582031
6488/28840	I shall take better care of them myself answered DArtagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt	90.56050109863281
6489/28840	I will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his em	41.844749450683594
6490/28840	You think of starting at once then inquired Mord	169.83486938476562
6491/28840	Our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were	49.9333381652832
6492/28840	The young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant   You will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town	57.79952621459961
6493/28840	The sergeant made a sign of	156.3271484375
6494/28840	Instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town Mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence Cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent	92.87661743164062
6495/28840	Cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that Mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young	49.092376708984375
6496/28840	Mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw Cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being	183.12794494628906
6497/28840	Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered Cromwell did not	86.59671020507812
6498/28840	At last after a few moments Cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly	91.85587310791016
6499/28840	I said I wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young	62.20725631713867
6500/28840	They thought this order did not concern me sir nevertheless if you wish it I am ready to	59.53739547729492
6501/28840	Ah is it you Mordaunt said Cromwell the cloud passing away from his face since you are here it is well you may	76.2746810913086
6502/28840	To congratulate mewhat for   On the capture of Charles	86.87749481201172
6503/28840	I was much more really so two hours	234.38096618652344
6504/28840	How so general   Because England had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is	163.0977783203125
6505/28840	Have you seen him   Yes	23.992706298828125
6506/28840	What is his bearing   Mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the	46.72461700439453
6507/28840	What did he say   Some parting words to his	92.3403549194336
6508/28840	Has he any friends Then he added aloud Did he make any resistance   No sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of	76.71168518066406
6509/28840	To whom did he give up his sword   He did not give it up he broke	46.20618438720703
6510/28840	He did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more	133.8438262939453
6511/28840	I heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted Charles was killed said Cromwell staring very fixedly at Mord	132.16566467285156
6512/28840	What was his name   Lord	36.08065414428711
6513/28840	My uncle answered Mordaunt but traitors to England are no longer members of my	119.48287963867188
6514/28840	Cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy Shakespeare describes so well   Mordaunt he said you are a terrible	64.12393188476562
6515/28840	When the Lord commands said Mordaunt His commands are not to be	190.6907958984375
6516/28840	Abraham raised the knife against Isaac and Isaac was his	320.2627258300781
6517/28840	Yes said Cromwell but the Lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be	115.43931579589844
6518/28840	I have looked around me said Mordaunt and I have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the	72.29121398925781
6519/28840	You are strong among the strong Mordaunt he said and the Frenchmen how did they behave   Most fear	82.2188949584961
6520/28840	Yes yes murmured Cromwell the French fight well and if my glass was good and I mistake not they were foremost in the	170.6756134033203
6521/28840	It was the fault of their horses not	144.5663604736328
6522/28840	And the Scotch   They kept their word and never stirred said Mord	126.50472259521484
6523/28840	Wretched men   Their officers wish to see you	190.85208129882812
6524/28840	I have no time to see	20.342382431030273
6525/28840	Are they paid   Yes	83.665283203125
6526/28840	Let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its hills are high enough I have nothing more to do with them nor they with	145.15438842773438
6527/28840	Before I go said Mordaunt I have some questions and a favor to ask you	64.8375244140625
6528/28840	A favor from me   Mordaunt	88.39498901367188
6529/28840	I come to you my leader my head my father and I ask you master are you contented with me   Cromwell looked at him with aston	37.42197799682617
6530/28840	Yes said Cromwell you have done since I knew you not only your duty but more than your duty you have been a faithful friend a cautious negotiator a brave	70.60399627685547
6531/28840	Do you remember sir it was my idea the Scotch treaty for giving up the king   Yes the idea was	108.43904876708984
6532/28840	I had no such contempt for men	285.6508483886719
6533/28840	Was I not a good ambassador in France   Yes for Mazarin has granted what I	69.83073425292969
6534/28840	Have I not always fought for your glory and interests   Too ardently perhaps it is what I have just reproached you	75.3228530883789
6535/28840	But what is the meaning of all these questions   To tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these	43.738033294677734
6536/28840	Oh said Oliver with a slight curl of his lip I forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been	148.7633819580078
6537/28840	Sir I can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my	74.34888458251953
6538/28840	How is that   I have the payment under my hand I almost possess	106.79869079589844
6539/28840	What is it Have they offered you money Do you wish a step or some place in the government   Sir will you grant me my request   Let us hear what it is	83.0977554321289
6540/28840	Well then said Cromwell I promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request	93.46902465820312
6541/28840	Sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them   For their ransom have they then offered a large one inquired Crom	129.23715209960938
6542/28840	On the contrary I think they are poor	84.67257690429688
6543/28840	They are friends of yours then   Yes sir exclaimed Mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and I would lay down my life for	51.938846588134766
6544/28840	Very well Mordaunt exclaimed Cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more I will give them to you I will not even ask who they are do as you like with	96.53938293457031
6545/28840	Thank you sir exclaimed Mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should I lose it I should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my	70.37861633300781
6546/28840	He threw himself at the feet of Cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the Puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed	43.96790313720703
6547/28840	What said Cromwell arresting him for a moment as he arose is there nothing more you wish neither gold nor rank   You have given me all you can give me and from today your debt is	85.6292495727539
6548/28840	And Mordaunt darted out of the generals tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with	56.7579345703125
6549/28840	He has slain his uncle he murm	158.87884521484375
6550/28840	Alas what are my servants Possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of Heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the	140.9473876953125
6551/28840	Charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but I have none   And with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by Mord	69.81478881835938
6552/28840	Whilst Mordaunt was making his way to Cromwells tent DArtagnan and Porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at	43.52693557739258
6553/28840	The order given by Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by DArtagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned Athos and Aramis to exercise extreme	69.48111724853516
6554/28840	The prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerorswhich they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own	181.4345245361328
6555/28840	It would be impossible to describe Mousquetons astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen	72.59156036376953
6556/28840	Mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange	130.62445068359375
6557/28840	What upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one	109.18109893798828
6558/28840	The house to which DArtagnan and Porthos conducted Athos and Aramis was the one assigned to them by General Cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous	20.58633804321289
6559/28840	It was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of	56.356666564941406
6560/28840	The windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a	105.73953247070312
6561/28840	The two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring Mousqueton to take the four horses to the	69.28324127197266
6562/28840	Why dont we go in with them asked Porth	60.7962532043457
6563/28840	We must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied DArtagn	65.03665924072266
6564/28840	The sergeant and his men took possession of the little	95.01839447021484
6565/28840	DArtagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that	53.34668731689453
6566/28840	We have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your	149.9947967529297
6567/28840	There could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received DArtagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to General Cromwells	54.20583724975586
6568/28840	The sergeant answered that Puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his	277.05792236328125
6569/28840	Things look black enough replied Porthos I understand now why Aramis advised me to strangle that horrible Mord	89.93042755126953
6570/28840	Silence cried the Gascon do not utter that	94.09651947021484
6571/28840	But argued Porthos I speak French and they are all	138.29611206054688
6572/28840	DArtagnan looked at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man cannot help feeling at displays of crass	84.39617919921875
6573/28840	But as Porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying Let us go	57.228057861328125
6574/28840	They found Athos in profound despondency Aramis looked first at Porthos and then at DArtagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful	73.51055908203125
6575/28840	You want to know how we came here Tis easily	164.4748077392578
6576/28840	Mazarin sent us with a letter to General Crom	273.0036315917969
6577/28840	But how came you to fall into company with Mordaunt whom I bade you distrust asked Ath	100.3675537109375
6578/28840	And whom I advised you to strangle Porthos said Aram	25.661413192749023
6579/28840	There is a certain fatality in	112.66094970703125
6580/28840	Yes you are right DArtagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us So my dear Aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to	65.4192886352539
6581/28840	Zounds on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing	108.04302215576172
6582/28840	Yes added Athos I now ask you DArtagnan what side you are on Ah behold for what end the wretched Mazarin has made use of	101.92269897460938
6583/28840	Do you know in what crime you are today engaged In the capture of a king his degradation and his	173.04144287109375
6584/28840	Oh oh cried Porthos do you think so   You are exaggerating Athos we are not so far gone as that replied the	37.45387268066406
6585/28840	Good heavens we are on the very eve of	72.55280303955078
6586/28840	I say why is the king taken prisoner Those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a	172.39385986328125
6587/28840	Do you think it is to replace him on the throne that Cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling They will kill him you may be sure of	41.07969284057617
6588/28840	I dont maintain the contrary said DArtagn	18.045703887939453
6589/28840	A friend a wife a daughter have done us the honor to call us to their	100.03443908691406
6590/28840	We have served them to the best of our poor means and God will recompense the will forgive the want of	117.12450408935547
6591/28840	You may see matters differently DArtagnan and think	79.71820831298828
6592/28840	I will not attempt to argue with you but I blame	46.59439468383789
6593/28840	Heyday cried DArtagnan what matters it to me after all if Cromwell whos an Englishman revolts against his king who is a Scotchman I am myself a	103.78922271728516
6594/28840	I have nothing to do with these thingswhy hold me responsible   Yes said Porth	22.693204879760742
6595/28840	Because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen because the blind populace ungrateful and brutal always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above	190.0363311767578
6596/28840	And you you DArtagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of France bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagon	110.25769805908203
6597/28840	Ah DArtagnan perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman I say that you are very culp	28.60775375366211
6598/28840	DArtagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of Athos he encountered those of Aram	89.85206604003906
6599/28840	Porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said   Yes yes my dear count I feel that you are	45.76249313354492
6600/28840	Come he said stretching out his hand to DArtagnan come dont be sullen my dear son for I have said all this to you if not in the tone at least with the feelings of a	40.99790573120117
6601/28840	It would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all	62.29732131958008
6602/28840	But here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one cant	137.12261962890625
6603/28840	Who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house France his warda charming youth for we saw him in the campto fly to the aid of a rotten wormeaten royalty which is going to crumble one of these days like an old ho	129.2522430419922
6604/28840	The sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are	639.3972778320312
6605/28840	DArtagnan I am your prisonertreat me as	85.18241882324219
6606/28840	Ah pardieu said DArtagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very	29.721891403198242
6607/28840	No said Aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the Philipgh	96.6561050415039
6608/28840	And how were they treated asked DArtagn	43.12458419799805
6609/28840	Why said Aramis onehalf were hanged and the other half were	156.22476196289062
6610/28840	Well I said DArtagnan I answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor	56.77041244506836
6611/28840	Sang Diou let them come on Besidesdo you see that door Athos   Yes what then   Well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the	97.92555236816406
6612/28840	I recognize you there my brave DArtagnan replied Athos but you are no longer our	36.81435775756836
6613/28840	That door is guarded DArtagnan you know	55.06316375732422
6614/28840	Very well you will force it said Porth	36.94795227050781
6615/28840	There are only a dozen men at the	107.48999786376953
6616/28840	That would be nothing for us four it is too much for us	82.81256103515625
6617/28840	No divided as we now are we must	214.5624542236328
6618/28840	See the fatal example on the Vendomois road DArtagnan you so brave and you Porthos so valiant and so strongyou were beaten today Aramis and I are beaten in our	97.7799301147461
6619/28840	Now that never happened to us when we were four	58.82308578491211
6620/28840	Let us die then as De Winter has died as for me I will fly only on condition that we all fly	139.44625854492188
6621/28840	Impossible said DArtagnan we are under Mazarins	43.194976806640625
6622/28840	I know it and I have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as	118.9359359741211
6623/28840	Besides said Aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like DArtagnan and Porth	45.54889678955078
6624/28840	Be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our	133.06454467773438
6625/28840	As for myself I shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you Athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are	73.05049896240234
6626/28840	DArtagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his	62.06480026245117
6627/28840	At last   Do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you And wherefore should they do so What interest have they in your death Moreover you are our	117.524169921875
6628/28840	Fool cried Aramis knowest thou not then Mordaunt I have but exchanged with him one look yet that look convinced me that we were	185.75537109375
6629/28840	The truth is Im very sorry that I did not strangle him as you advised me said Porth	47.89849853515625
6630/28840	Eh I make no account of the harm Mordaunt can do cried DArtagn	51.81211471557617
6631/28840	Cap de Diou if he troubles me too much I will crush him the insect Do not fly	221.76759338378906
6632/28840	It is useless for I swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years agoyou Athos in the Rue Ferou and you Aramis in the Rue de Vaugir	62.16897201538086
6633/28840	Stop cried Athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted you will soon know what to expect for here he	48.23080825805664
6634/28840	In fact looking at the place to which Athos pointed DArtagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gall	40.24756622314453
6635/28840	Stay said DArtagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the	57.21269607543945
6636/28840	When Mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw DArtagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their	49.99800109863281
6637/28840	Halloo he cried are the prisoners still there   Yes sir answered the sergeant uncover	78.13771057128906
6638/28840	Tis well order four men to conduct them to my	252.58343505859375
6639/28840	What is it said DArtagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his	45.971473693847656
6640/28840	What is the matter if you please   Sir replied Mordaunt I have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my	39.28731918334961
6641/28840	Wherefore sir Excuse curiosity but I wish to be enlightened on the	108.16132354736328
6642/28840	Because these prisoners sir are at my disposal and I choose to dispose of them as I	84.60372161865234
6643/28840	Allow meallow me sir said DArtagnan to observe you are in	28.156320571899414
6644/28840	The prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them	132.99578857421875
6645/28840	You might have taken Lord Winterwho tis said was your uncleprisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I could have killed our prisonerswe preferred taking	93.09907531738281
6646/28840	Mordaunts very lips grew white with	4080.023681640625
6647/28840	DArtagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guards march upon the	106.1174087524414
6648/28840	At the first beat Porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the	26.7675724029541
6649/28840	Sir he thus addressed DArtagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron Oliver Crom	103.59920501708984
6650/28840	These words struck DArtagnan like a thunder	46.07657241821289
6651/28840	The blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his	56.25472640991211
6652/28840	As for Porthos he looked inquiringly at DArtagn	12.261981964111328
6653/28840	This look of Porthoss made the Gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly	106.47265625
6654/28840	Violence he said to himself would spoil all DArtagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he	80.53949737548828
6655/28840	Why did you not say so at once my dear sir all England is with Cromwell and since you ask for my prisoners I bend sir to your	83.85487365722656
6656/28840	Mordaunt delighted advanced Porthos looking at DArtagnan with openmouthed aston	96.05705261230469
6657/28840	Then DArtagnan trod on his foot and Porthos began to understand that this was merely	44.169189453125
6658/28840	Mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow	49.765464782714844
6659/28840	But pardon said DArtagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young mans shoulder if the illustrious General Oliver Cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in	50.200496673583984
6660/28840	He has given you some little writing for methe least bit of paper which may show that you come in his	135.66688537597656
6661/28840	Be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that I may justify by a pretext at least my abandoning my country	154.10385131835938
6662/28840	Otherwise you see although I am sure that General Oliver Cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad	56.09532165527344
6663/28840	Mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at DArtagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human count	141.64601135253906
6664/28840	When I tell you a thing sir said Mordaunt you insult me by doubting	62.20248031616211
6665/28840	I cried DArtagnan I doubt what you say God keep me from it my dear Monsieur Mordaunt On the contrary I take you to be a worthy and accomplished	32.09756088256836
6666/28840	And then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued DArtagnan with his frank	43.53652572631836
6667/28840	Monsieur du Vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about	39.81645584106445
6668/28840	I do not speak for him but for	41.71990966796875
6669/28840	Well sir What more   WellIIm not	134.9675750732422

6672/28840	is the king of the Spaniards never had a penny in his	40.42743682861328
6673/28840	Go on sir I see what you wish to get at and if it is simply what I think that stops you I can obviate the	93.71568298339844
6674/28840	Ah I knew well said the Gascon that you were a man of	33.85858917236328
6675/28840	Well heres the case heres where the saddle hurts me as we French	225.47463989257812
6676/28840	I am an officer of fortune nothing else I have nothing but what my sword brings me inthat is to say more blows than bank	100.66923522949219
6677/28840	Now on taking prisoners this morning two Frenchmen who seemed to me of high birthin short two knights of the GarterI said to myself my fortune is	124.50650024414062
6678/28840	I say two because in such circumstances Monsieur du Vallon who is rich always gives me his	68.1946029663086
6679/28840	No replied DArtagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour I am a man of order sir let us do things in	40.74512481689453
6680/28840	Nevertheless replied Mordaunt I could compel you I command	111.62294006347656
6681/28840	Ah sir said DArtagnan I see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know	27.422822952270508
6682/28840	We are gentlemen we are both of us able to kill you and your eight menwe two	199.7976531982422
6683/28840	For Heavens sake dont be obstinate for when others are obstinate I am obstinate likewise and then I become ferocious and headstrong and theres my friend who is even more headstrong and ferocious than	103.92887878417969
6684/28840	Ask him then for the written	280.4442443847656
6685/28840	What will that cost you my dear Monsieur Mordaunt   Yes the written order said Porthos who now began to comprehend what DArtagnan was aiming at we ask only for	36.65206527709961
6686/28840	However inclined Mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons DArtagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four Frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the	85.2156982421875
6687/28840	He decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the	89.02581787109375
6688/28840	He therefore mounted his horse and	77.25931549072266
6689/28840	Good thought DArtagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we	23.33241081237793
6690/28840	Go to the stable you will find Mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddlebags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my	90.7609634399414
6691/28840	Porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his	84.16802215576172
6692/28840	I go he said only shall I enter the chamber where those gentlemen are   No it is not worth	76.44420623779297
6693/28840	Well do me the kindness to take my purse which I left on the mantel	65.29957580566406
6694/28840	He then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great	87.01268768310547
6695/28840	At the corner of the street he met Mousqueton and took him with	29.1510066986084
6696/28840	DArtagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before Porthos went	29.931793212890625
6697/28840	My dear Athos I have reflected on your arguments and I am	35.369781494140625
6698/28840	I am sorry to have had anything to do with this	34.44169235229492

6702/28840	Well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he	137.3263702392578

6706/28840	That will be the signal when I call outJesus Seigneur   But give us your word that you will come too DArtagnan said Ath	37.65840148925781
6707/28840	Tis settled said Aramis at the cry Jesus Seigneur we go out upset all that stands in our way run to our horses jump into our saddles spur them is that all  	124.72726440429688
6708/28840	See Aramis as I have told you DArtagnan is first amongst us all said Ath	30.22395896911621
6709/28840	Very true replied the Gascon but I always run away from	86.54869079589844
6710/28840	Dont forget the signal Jesus Seigneur and he went out as he came in whistling the selfsame	74.75514221191406
6711/28840	The soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm On the rivers of	235.1707763671875
6712/28840	My dear friend General Cromwell has sent Monsieur Mordaunt to fetch	29.148761749267578
6713/28840	Guard the prisoners well I beg of	113.24981689453125
6714/28840	The sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand French and DArtagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and	43.64107894897461
6715/28840	Then he went into the stable he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the	71.6408920288086
6716/28840	Each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to Porthos and Mousqueton turn to the left so that Athos and Aramis may see you clearly from the	30.218114852905273
6717/28840	You didnt forget my purse   No be	228.53094482421875
6718/28840	Porthos and Mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their	52.19253921508789
6719/28840	Then DArtagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the	29.963788986206055
6720/28840	There caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his	158.53201293945312
6721/28840	It was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been	66.17951202392578
6722/28840	The soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran	246.42453002929688
6723/28840	Help help cried DArtagnan stopmy horse has the stag	117.2003173828125
6724/28840	In an instant the horses eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with	142.99293518066406
6725/28840	What will you let me be killed Jesus Seigneur   No sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and Athos and Aramis rushed	33.937015533447266
6726/28840	The coast owing to the Gascons stratagem was	104.34858703613281
6727/28840	The prisoners are escaping the prisoners are escaping cried the	362.42340087890625
6728/28840	Stop stop cried DArtagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several	113.23922729492188
6729/28840	Stop stop cried the soldiers and ran for their	237.62710571289062
6730/28840	But the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest	68.54512786865234
6731/28840	In the middle of the street they saw Grimaud and Blaisois who were coming to find their	30.192455291748047
6732/28840	With one wave of his hand Athos made Grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind DArtagnan still directing them from behind with his	90.72431182861328
6733/28840	They passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open	130.28579711914062
6734/28840	All this time the soldiers were calling out Stop stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of	74.77153778076172
6735/28840	Whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen	113.6630859375
6736/28840	It was Mordaunt with the order in his	38.653446197509766
6737/28840	The prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his	263.4374084472656
6738/28840	The sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty	141.21755981445312
6739/28840	Mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone	157.79962158203125
6740/28840	Noble Natures never lose Courage nor good Stomachs their Appet	1270.0184326171875
6741/28840	The little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be	162.9121551513672
6742/28840	At last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its	87.54473114013672
6743/28840	As soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council	92.9045639038086
6744/28840	The two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and Grimaud was posted as sent	90.9411392211914
6745/28840	Come first of all said Athos to DArtagnan my friend that I may shake hands with youyou our rescueryou the true hero of us	76.78498840332031
6746/28840	Athos is rightyou have my adoration said Aramis in his turn pressing his	67.25323486328125
6747/28840	The two friends recalled by DArtagnan to what was also due to Porthos pressed his hand in their	42.112648010253906
6748/28840	And now said Athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our	104.15277862548828
6749/28840	What shall we do   What are we going to do ifaith It is not very difficult to	22.096614837646484
6750/28840	We are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to	222.31741333007812
6751/28840	As for me I will give my last sou for	49.80933380126953
6752/28840	Life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a	268.1589660644531
6753/28840	What do you say to this Du Vallon   I said Porthos I am entirely of DArtagnans opinion this is a beastly country this	38.93815612792969
6754/28840	You are quite decided then to leave it asked Athos of DArtagn	27.65349769592285
6755/28840	Egad I dont see what is to keep me	104.5946273803711
6756/28840	A glance was exchanged between Athos and Aram	59.5593147277832
6757/28840	Go then my friends said the former sigh	143.91152954101562
6758/28840	Let us go you mean   No my friend said Athos you must leave	29.362472534179688
6759/28840	Leave you cried DArtagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected	25.755327224731445
6760/28840	Bah said Porthos why separate since we are all together   Because you can and ought to return to France your mission is accomplished but ours is	74.80699157714844
6761/28840	Your mission is not accomplished exclaimed DArtagnan looking in astonishment at Ath	34.970191955566406
6762/28840	Aramis contented himself by making a sign with his	58.8203125
6763/28840	DArtagnans countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with mad	51.6695442199707
6764/28840	You cannot be speaking seriously Athos said he the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to	86.23273468017578
6765/28840	This army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcherit matters littleColonel	240.73838806152344
6766/28840	His majesty I can assure you will be tried on his arrival in London I have heard enough from the lips of Oliver Cromwell to know what to	56.251346588134766
6767/28840	A second look was exchanged between Athos and Aram	62.070011138916016
6768/28840	And when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued DArtagn	61.42078399658203
6769/28840	And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked Ath	64.57874298095703
6770/28840	The penalty of death I greatly fear they have gone too far for him to pardon them and there is nothing left to them but one thing and that is to kill	75.86338806152344
6771/28840	Have you never heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he came to Paris and was shown the dungeon at Vincennes where Monsieur de Vendome was imprisoned   What did he say asked Porth	28.8585147857666
6772/28840	Princes must be knocked on the	627.4133911132812
6773/28840	And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king   On the contrary I am certain he will do	55.129005432128906
6774/28840	But then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so	86.78971099853516
6775/28840	No my friend Athos gently replied but De Winter sought us out in France and introduced us Monsieur dHerblay and myself to Madame Henri	44.1646842956543
6776/28840	Her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her	260.7604064941406
6777/28840	We engaged our word our word included	1117.116943359375
6778/28840	It was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we	379.6853942871094
6779/28840	It remains now for us to keep our	110.9263687133789
6780/28840	Is that your opinion DHerblay   Yes said Aramis we have	21.542734146118164
6781/28840	Then continued Athos we have another reason it is thislisten In France at this moment everything is poor and palt	79.08848571777344
6782/28840	I have served them without enthusiasmGod knows that I estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteembut on	123.0955810546875
6783/28840	Today I am engaged in a different	69.17621612548828
6784/28840	I have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a European misfortune I attach myself to	246.4288787841797
6785/28840	If we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be	77.33963012695312
6786/28840	So you know beforehand you must perish said DArtagn	18.766780853271484
6787/28840	We fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of	204.29896545410156
6788/28840	What will you do in a foreign land an enemys country   I traveled in England when I was young I speak English like an Englishman and Aramis too knows something of the	91.49732971191406
6789/28840	In Heavens name my dear Athos do not make a useless	69.54131317138672
6790/28840	When I see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak I seem to have to do with a mad	88.45744323730469
6791/28840	Come Porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business   Nothing good replied Porth	33.45660400390625
6792/28840	Come continued DArtagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my	40.419281005859375
6793/28840	Well then believe me Athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to France with	96.17938995361328
6794/28840	Friend said Athos our resolution is irrevoc	63.06590270996094
6795/28840	Only reflect my good fellow said Athos it is but dying rather	105.56648254394531
6796/28840	Pooh a little sooner or a little later it isnt worth quarreling	227.3543701171875
6797/28840	If I am astonished at anything remarked Porthos sententiously it is that it has not already	84.22828674316406
6798/28840	Oh it will happen you may be sure said DArtagn	17.91120147705078
6799/28840	So it is agreed and if Porthos makes no objection   I said Porthos I will do whatever you please and besides I think what the Comte de la Fere said just now is very	25.588468551635742
6800/28840	But your future career DArtagnanyour ambition Porthos   Our future our ambition replied DArtagnan with feverish volub	62.58081817626953
6801/28840	Or he will forget us added DArtagn	40.79865646362305
6802/28840	It seems to me that we once rendered Anne of Austria a service not much less than that which today we are trying to perform for Charles	86.60450744628906
6803/28840	but none the less Anne of Austria has forgotten us for twenty	71.24021911621094
6804/28840	Well in spite of that DArtagnan said Athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her   No indeed said DArtagnan I admit even that in my darkest moments I find consolation in that	33.59055709838867
6805/28840	You see then DArtagnan though princes often are ungrateful God never	122.0369873046875
6806/28840	Athos said DArtagnan I believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to	44.38579177856445
6807/28840	So then said Athos offering his hand to DArtagn	11.13828182220459
6808/28840	I find England a charming country and I staybut on one condition	298.895263671875
6809/28840	What is it   That I am not forced to learn	46.764862060546875
6810/28840	Well now said Athos triumphantly I swear to you my friend by the God who hears usI believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see France	95.30135345458984
6811/28840	So be it said DArtagnan but II confess I have a contrary	82.82132720947266
6812/28840	Our good DArtagnan said Aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does a	145.5453643798828
6813/28840	But in the meantime saves the country added Ath	85.21228790283203
6814/28840	Well now that everything is decided cried Porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner It seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always d	99.69444274902344
6815/28840	Oh yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink	242.62429809570312
6816/28840	What the devil did you come to such a country for Athos But I forgot added the Gascon smiling pardon I forgot you are no longer Athos but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner Porth	61.4526252746582
6817/28840	My plan   Yes have you a plan   No I am hungry that is	37.548851013183594
6818/28840	Mouston appeared with a most piteous	228.1460723876953
6819/28840	What is the matter my dear	19.642784118652344
6820/28840	Are you ill   Sir I am very hungry replied M	55.65835952758789
6821/28840	Well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good	59.463539123535156
6822/28840	Could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel Faith I do not remember the name of the	118.32263946533203
6823/28840	At the hotel of said Porthos by my faithnor do I remember it	86.82063293457031
6824/28840	How is there a house in the neighborhood asked DArtagn	26.90280532836914
6825/28840	Well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that	74.59544372558594
6826/28840	What is your opinion gentlemen and does not	72.50469970703125
6827/28840	But if he should be a cavalier said Porth	18.15713882446289
6828/28840	In that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowl	62.64593505859375
6829/28840	You are very happy exclaimed Athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible Gascon for you see the bright side of	57.329383850097656
6830/28840	I come from a land where there is not a cloud in the	71.54503631591797
6831/28840	It is not like this then said Porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of	78.22356414794922
6832/28840	Come come said DArtagnan more reason why we should start on our	44.277496337890625
6833/28840	Well Grimaud my friend have you seen anything asked the Gas	47.26622772216797
6834/28840	Those idiots cried Porthos they have not even pursued	152.9461669921875
6835/28840	Oh if we had been in their place   Yes they are wrong said DArtagn	25.192115783691406
6836/28840	I would willingly have said two words to Mordaunt in this little	106.92149353027344
6837/28840	It is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper	234.8774871826172
6838/28840	I think decidedly observed Aramis gentlemen that the son hasnt his mothers	268.41571044921875
6839/28840	What my good fellow replied Athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours agohe does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we	74.8673324584961
6840/28840	We may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in France if we are not poisoned or killed before	95.31480407714844
6841/28840	Ifaith yes said Athos for I am	88.65577697753906
6842/28840	Look out for the black fowls cried Aram	54.91012191772461
6843/28840	And the four friends guided by Mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as Athos had said all four once more united and of single	100.60421752929688
6844/28840	As our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded	102.01079559326172
6845/28840	Before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted	337.8235168457031
6846/28840	Egad cried DArtagnan its quite clear that the king and his escort have been by	67.77825164794922
6847/28840	The devil said Porthos in that case they have eaten	52.944122314453125
6848/28840	Bah said DArtagnan they will have left a chicken at	26.490642547607422
6849/28840	He dismounted and knocked on the	40.64967727661133
6850/28840	He pushed open the door and found the first room empty and	106.54904174804688
6851/28840	Aha   What   Blood   At this word the three friends leaped from their horses and	56.67572021484375
6852/28840	DArtagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary	41.713165283203125
6853/28840	The three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of	69.42485046386719
6854/28840	It was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do	42.8816032409668
6855/28840	Athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to	84.77139282226562
6856/28840	Well if he is dead said Athos he has not been so long for he is still	29.57829475402832
6857/28840	Ho there my friend   The wounded man heaved a	50.70161056518555
6858/28840	DArtagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his	26.941537857055664
6859/28840	The man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back	43.898624420166016
6860/28840	The wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing cop	152.45584106445312
6861/28840	Aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the g	199.39364624023438
6862/28840	Again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity	48.680355072021484
6863/28840	You are among friends said Athos in English so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened   The king muttered the wounded man the king is a	50.40718078613281
6864/28840	You have seen him asked Aramis in the same	25.299053192138672
6865/28840	Make your mind easy resumed Athos we are all faithful servants of his	63.89449691772461
6866/28840	Is what you tell me true asked the wounded	49.66883087158203
6867/28840	I am brother to Parry his majestys lac	48.74345779418945
6868/28840	Athos and Aramis remembered that this was the name by which De Winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the kings	52.353824615478516
6869/28840	We know him said Athos he never left the	75.77997589111328
6870/28840	Well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was	51.89557647705078
6871/28840	They brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and	81.31044006347656
6872/28840	Parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at	137.3797607421875
6873/28840	He knew that there was a trapdoor communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the or	73.0967788696289
6874/28840	He made a sign which I understood but the kings guards must have noticed it and held themselves on	88.65345764160156
6875/28840	I went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst Parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow	53.4497184753418
6876/28840	But Parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he	74.31167602539062
6877/28840	The king was a few steps behind me when suddenly I saw something rise up in front of me like a huge	132.78204345703125
6878/28840	I wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment I felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell ins	69.53362274169922
6879/28840	When I came to myself again I was stretched in the same	54.7222900390625
6880/28840	I dragged myself as far as the	94.157470703125
6881/28840	The king and his escort were no longer	74.07891845703125
6882/28840	I spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and I fainted	130.4640350341797
6883/28840	And now how are you feeling   Very ill replied the wounded	95.23394012451172
6884/28840	Can we do anything for you asked Ath	63.46438217163086
6885/28840	Help to put me on the bed I think I shall feel better	62.607383728027344
6886/28840	Have you any one to depend on for assistance   My wife is at Durham and may return at any	120.8397216796875
6887/28840	But youis there nothing that you want   We came here with the intention of asking for something to	75.85347747802734
6888/28840	Alas they have taken everything there isnt a morsel of bread in the	121.64894104003906
6889/28840	You hear DArtagnan said Athos we shall have to look elsewhere for our	35.776268005371094
6890/28840	It is all one to me now said DArtagnan I am no longer	24.048824310302734
6891/28840	They carried the man to his bed and called Grimaud to dress the	75.79779052734375
6892/28840	In the service of the four friends Grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a	93.32801818847656
6893/28840	In the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel	89.08683776855469
6894/28840	Now said Aramis we know how the matter	48.3929328918457
6895/28840	The king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direction eh   Athos did not reply he	92.64484405517578
6896/28840	Yes said Porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of	65.67144775390625
6897/28840	What a confounded country this England is This is the first time I have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best	110.7702865600586
6898/28840	What do you think DArtagnan asked Ath	10.140718460083008
6899/28840	Do you agree with Aramis   Not at all said DArtagnan I am precisely of the contrary	34.062400817871094
6900/28840	What you would follow the escort exclaimed Porthos in	73.01244354248047
6901/28840	Let DArtagnan speak said Athos you know he always has wise advice to	57.867008209228516
6902/28840	Clearly said DArtagnan we must go where they will not look for	18.9451847076416
6903/28840	Now they will be far from looking for us among the Puritans therefore with the Puritans we must	90.13739776611328
6904/28840	I was about to give it when you anticipated	45.5953254699707
6905/28840	That then is your opinion asked Aram	76.33551788330078
6906/28840	They will think we are trying to leave England and will search for us at the ports meanwhile we shall reach London with the	82.31634521484375
6907/28840	Once in London we shall be hard to findwithout considering continued Athos throwing a glance at Aramis the chances that may come to us on the	81.13762664794922
6908/28840	I however do not understand said Porth	24.33260726928711
6909/28840	But no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of DArtagnan and of Athos it must be the	24.17389678955078
6910/28840	But said Aramis shall we not be suspected by Colonel Harrison   Egad cried DArtagnan hes just the man I count	51.88713836669922
6911/28840	Colonel Harrison is one of our	63.849178314208984
6912/28840	We have met him twice at General Cromwell	62.47414016723633
6913/28840	He knows that we were sent from France by Monsieur Mazarin he will consider us as	58.879661560058594
6914/28840	Besides is he not a butchers son Well then Porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and I how to trip up a bull by taking him by the	110.25880432128906
6915/28840	You are the best companion that I know DArtagnan he said offering his hand to the Gascon and I am very happy in having found you again my dear	34.184486389160156
6916/28840	This was as we have seen the term which Athos applied to DArtagnan in his more expansive mood	44.73807144165039
6917/28840	He had stanched the wound and the man was	283.6600646972656
6918/28840	The four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his	96.36884307861328
6919/28840	Tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me	89.2610092163086
6920/28840	However insignificant I am I am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my	97.52517700195312
6921/28840	Be easy said DArtagnan he will know all before	56.96975326538086
6922/28840	The little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league	88.83151245117188
6923/28840	My dear friends said DArtagnan give your swords to Monsieur Mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our	37.40188217163086
6924/28840	It was not long before they joined the	173.93603515625
6925/28840	The king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw Athos and Aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale	69.3429946899414
6926/28840	DArtagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of Porthos went straight to Harrison who recognized him as having met him at Cromwells and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition	44.73110580444336
6927/28840	It turned out as DArtagnan had fore	25.527318954467773
6928/28840	The colonel neither had nor could have any	339.9085693359375
6929/28840	They halted for the king to d	102.36788177490234
6930/28840	This time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at	354.16162109375
6931/28840	In the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the	77.26487731933594
6932/28840	Will you dine with me asked Harrison of DArtagn	30.471670150756836
6933/28840	Gad I should be very happy but I have my companion Monsieur du Vallon and the two prisoners whom I cannot	30.32561683654785
6934/28840	Have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from	242.24884033203125
6935/28840	The matter was arranged as DArtagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where Parry waited on him Harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his	92.05973052978516
6936/28840	The table at which the Puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention Harrison sat with his back to the	171.6228790283203
6937/28840	The king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of	145.45309448242188
6938/28840	They sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on	70.07874298095703
6939/28840	The officers table and that of the king were opposite to	95.09354400634766
6940/28840	Ifaith colonel said DArtagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without	123.62787628173828
6941/28840	My friend here Monsieur du Vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly	60.36946487426758
6942/28840	And I am so still said Porthos bowing to	49.53125
6943/28840	And how said Harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you   In a very simple manner colonel said DArtagn	79.80660247802734
6944/28840	I was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone	53.84757995605469
6945/28840	Yes said Harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his	89.48896789550781
6946/28840	When Groslow undertakes this kind of thing theres no need to go over the ground a second	79.92469787597656
6947/28840	Ah it was this gentleman said DArtagnan bowing to the	16.133316040039062
6948/28840	I am sorry he does not speak French that I might tender him my	102.28712463378906
6949/28840	I am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good French for I resided three years in	128.4014434814453
6950/28840	Then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your	70.06006622314453
6951/28840	Nearly I thought I had quite said Gros	37.36869812011719
6952/28840	It was a very near thing but he is not	46.67803192138672
6953/28840	As he said this DArtagnan gave a glance at Parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for	35.376590728759766
6954/28840	The king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed	272.1570129394531
6955/28840	Hang it said Groslow I thought I had succeeded	80.62002563476562
6956/28840	If it were not so far from here to the house I would return and finish	65.78964233398438
6957/28840	And you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a	86.1800765991211
6958/28840	And DArtagnan threw a second glance toward Parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that Charles stretched out his hand to him	51.481422424316406
6959/28840	Parry bent over his masters hand and kissed it	306.13165283203125
6960/28840	Ive a great desire to drink the kings health said Ath	102.71591186523438
6961/28840	Let me propose it then said DArtagn	34.55080032348633
6962/28840	Porthos looked at DArtagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companions Gascon sharpness continually supplied	97.02653503417969
6963/28840	DArtagnan took up his camp tin cup filled it with wine and	113.09520721435547
6964/28840	Gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the rep	152.7355499267578
6965/28840	Heres to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as London and	106.11325073242188
6966/28840	And as DArtagnan as he spoke looked at Harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for	83.54332733154297
6967/28840	He arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on Charles while Harrison emptied his glass without the slightest mis	78.31437683105469
6968/28840	The king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and	96.05875396728516

6973/28840	If what you say is sincere replied Athos he will never reach	56.03482437133789
6974/28840	How so   Because before then we shall have carried him	45.67100143432617
6975/28840	Well this time Athos said DArtagnan upon my word you are	29.404905319213867
6976/28840	Have you some plan in your head then asked Aram	64.04551696777344
6977/28840	Ay said Porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good	36.3682861328125
6978/28840	I have none said Athos but DArtagnan will discover	26.12868309020996
6979/28840	DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders and they	18.992889404296875
6980/28840	As night closed in they arrived at Thir	250.7886505126953
6981/28840	The four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the	163.6558837890625
6982/28840	They withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an	127.08088684082031
6983/28840	The lackeys were sent to their several posts except that Grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the	112.26776123046875
6984/28840	DArtagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loqu	63.90098571777344
6985/28840	Porthos who could never see anything that was not selfevident talked to him as	117.13829803466797
6986/28840	He replied in monosyllables and Athos and Aramis looked significantly at one	60.7724609375
6987/28840	Next morning DArtagnan was the first to	41.77690505981445
6988/28840	He had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst Athos and Aramis were still in bed and Porthos sn	53.13568115234375
6989/28840	At eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that DArtagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with Monsieur Gros	34.54348373413086
6990/28840	Groslow whom DArtagnans praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious	81.26334381103516
6991/28840	Really sir DArtagnan said to him I am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor	53.36534881591797
6992/28840	My friend Monsieur du Vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all	50.74497604370117
6993/28840	As for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for	159.57949829101562
6994/28840	The more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the Stuart for whom I hope youre preparing a pretty	112.5283432006836
6995/28840	Why said Groslow that is just what we are taking him to London	56.856590270996094
6996/28840	And you never by any chance lose sight of him I presume   I should think not	60.60276412963867
6997/28840	You see he has a truly royal	444.18878173828125
6998/28840	Ay theres no fear in the daytime but at night   We redouble our	118.34757995605469
6999/28840	And what method of surveillance do you employ   Eight men remain constantly in his	182.83531188964844
7000/28840	The deuce he is well guarded	164.98782348632812
7001/28840	But besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside   Oh no Just	447.6678771972656
7002/28840	What would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men   Two menhow do you mean   Yes the king and his lac	61.76708984375

7004/28840	Under pretense that hes a king it appears he cannot dress or undress without	358.101318359375
7005/28840	Really captain said DArtagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more I listen to you the more surprised I am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak	60.48927688598633
7006/28840	You have lived three years in Paris May I ask what you were doing there   My father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in	97.84364318847656
7007/28840	Were you pleased with Paris sir   Yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our ownnot against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an Italian the queens	115.03466796875
7008/28840	Ah I am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of Mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorrupt	80.60999298095703
7009/28840	But said the officer I thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to General Crom	34.45780563354492
7010/28840	That is to say I am in the kings service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to England I solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three	71.19125366210938
7011/28840	So that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old England you see how we snapped up the	133.696044921875
7012/28840	Yes I know that you charged by the side of Mord	43.552650451660156
7013/28840	Ah theres another brave and excellent young	286.9951477050781
7014/28840	Do you know him asked the	45.308963775634766
7015/28840	Monsieur du Vallon and myself came from France with	34.042999267578125
7016/28840	It appears too you kept him waiting a long time at Boulog	60.507999420166016
7017/28840	What would you have I was like you and had a king in	99.86048889160156
7018/28840	Aha said Groslow what king   Our own to be sure the little oneLouis	142.38133239746094
7019/28840	And how long had you to take care of him   Three nights and by my troth I shall always remember those three nights with a certain	81.57125091552734
7020/28840	How do you mean   I mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking d	98.7636947631836
7021/28840	Ah true said the Englishman with a sigh you Frenchmen are born boon	85.25028991699219
7022/28840	And dont you play too when you are on guard   Never said the English	66.19298553466797
7023/28840	In that case you must be horribly bored and have my	115.22016906738281
7024/28840	The fact is I look to my turn for keeping guard with	258.2278137207031
7025/28840	Its tiresome work to keep awake a whole	1020.2548828125
7026/28840	Yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a	143.2945556640625
7027/28840	You dont like playing then   On the contrary I	38.91421127319336
7028/28840	Lansquenet for instance   Devoted to	263.6501770019531
7029/28840	I used to play almost every night in	129.94821166992188
7030/28840	And since your return to England   I have not handled a card or dice	115.66903686523438
7031/28840	I sincerely pity you said DArtagnan with an air of profound	40.23566818237305
7032/28840	Well   Tomorrow I am on	59.27239990234375
7033/28840	In Stuarts room   Yes come and pass the night with	139.61227416992188
7034/28840	Impossible   Impossible why so   I play with Monsieur du Vallon every	41.376338958740234
7035/28840	Sometimes we dont go to bed at all   Well what of that   Why he would be annoyed if I did not play with	39.05204772949219
7036/28840	Does he play well   I have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while till the tears rolled	81.59941864013672
7037/28840	But how about our prisoners   Let your servants guard	127.96473693847656
7038/28840	Yes and give them a chance of escaping said DArtagn	25.86412811279297
7039/28840	Why one of them is a rich lord from Touraine and the other a knight of Malta of noble	84.19054412841797
7040/28840	We have arranged the ransom of each of them2000 on arriving in	130.82791137695312
7041/28840	We are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be	238.6842498779297
7042/28840	It is true we plundered them a little when we took them and I will even confess that it is their purse that Monsieur du Vallon and I draw on in our nightly	56.853878021240234
7043/28840	Still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their	180.96827697753906
7044/28840	We have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while I sleep Monsieur du Vallon	61.3270149230957
7045/28840	You see then why I must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the months end nothing is gained or	285.7128601074219
7046/28840	Ah said Groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at	77.89081573486328
7047/28840	But come resumed the Englishman are these men of yours dangerous   In what respect   Are they capable of attempting violence   DArtagnan burst out laughing at the	59.045711517333984
7048/28840	Well then said Groslow bring them with	45.1140022277832
7049/28840	I have eight men on guard you	119.58918762207031
7050/28840	Four of them can guard the king and the other four your	167.3205108642578
7051/28840	Ill manage it somehow you will	503.9393615722656
7052/28840	But said DArtagnan now I think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning tonight   Nothing at all said Gros	29.936241149902344
7053/28840	Come to us this evening and tomorrow well return your	291.5131530761719
7054/28840	Capital This evening with you tomorrow at Stuarts the next day with	169.91465759277344
7055/28840	You see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said DArtagn	93.51556396484375
7056/28840	Yes with Frenchmen and Frenchmen like	192.5023651123047
7057/28840	And Monsieur du Vallon added the	13.789613723754883
7058/28840	You will see what a fellow he is a man who nearly killed Mazarin between two	75.89432525634766
7059/28840	They employ him because they are afraid of	114.76860809326172
7060/28840	Ah there he is calling me	189.3619842529297
7061/28840	They exchanged bows and DArtagnan returned to his	32.44126892089844
7062/28840	What on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed Porth	56.02680587768555
7063/28840	My dear fellow dont speak like that of Monsieur Gros	22.290775299072266
7064/28840	Hes one of my most intimate	63.48474884033203
7065/28840	One of your friends cried Porthos this butcher of unarmed farmers   Hush my dear Porth	27.186857223510742
7066/28840	Monsieur Groslow is perhaps rather hasty its true but at bottom I have discovered two good qualities in himhe is conceited and	125.07472229003906
7067/28840	Porthos opened his eyes in amazement Athos and Aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew DArtagnan and knew that he did nothing without a	36.54790115356445
7068/28840	But continued DArtagnan you shall judge of him for	31.73577117919922
7069/28840	He is coming to play with us this	56.06636047363281
7070/28840	Oho said Porthos his eyes glistening at the	29.641620635986328
7071/28840	Is he rich   Hes the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in	89.04118347167969
7072/28840	And knows lansquenet   Adores	598.5626831054688
7073/28840	Good said Porthos we shall pass an agreeable	45.7008171081543
7074/28840	The more so as it will be the prelude to a	70.0807113647461
7075/28840	How so   We invite him to play tonight he has invited us in return	94.4283218383789
7076/28840	Tonight we stop at Derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let Mousqueton buy	73.2176513671875
7077/28840	It will be well to prepare a light supper of which you Athos and Aramis are not to partakeAthos because I told him you had a fever Aramis because you are a knight of Malta and wont mix with fellows like	88.38883972167969
7078/28840	Do you understand   Thats no doubt very fine said Porthos but deuce take me if I understand at	43.162437438964844
7079/28840	Porthos my friend you know I am descended on the fathers side from the Prophets and on the mothers from the Sybils and that I only speak in parables and r	104.8125
7080/28840	Let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see I can tell you nothing more at	107.93859100341797
7081/28840	Go ahead my friend said Athos I am sure that whatever you do is well	60.00475311279297
7082/28840	And you Aramis are you of that opinion   Entirely so my dear DArtagn	36.25751876831055
7083/28840	Very good said DArtagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving Porthos who must see and touch before he will	83.86795043945312
7084/28840	The fact is said Porthos with an air of finesse I am rather incred	56.84406661987305
7085/28840	DArtagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended	45.259735107421875
7086/28840	At five in the evening they sent Mousqueton on before as agreed	136.29234313964844
7087/28840	In crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends perceived Blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome	81.52186584472656
7088/28840	It was there a lodging was prepared for	139.7042999267578
7089/28840	At the hour agreed upon Groslow	61.31859588623047
7090/28840	DArtagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years	24.447786331176758
7091/28840	Porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to Parrys brother he was not nearly so strong as	86.84153747558594
7092/28840	Athos and Aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and	103.69681549072266
7093/28840	In short Groslow seemed to be pleased with his	63.42502212524414
7094/28840	Athos and Aramis kept themselves to their	115.38384246826172
7095/28840	At midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly	146.83433532714844
7096/28840	Furthermore DArtagnan went with them leaving Porthos at play with Gros	37.966854095458984
7097/28840	Porthos gained fifty pistoles from Groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to	53.29821014404297
7098/28840	As to Groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from DArtagnan what he had lost to Porthos and on leaving reminded the Gascon of his	44.28004837036133
7099/28840	The next day was spent as	250.58770751953125
7100/28840	DArtagnan went from Captain Groslow to Colonel Harrison and from Colonel Harrison to his	47.57511901855469
7101/28840	To any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friendsto Athos and Aramiswas apparent a certain feverishness in his gay	77.25585174560547
7102/28840	Porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from Groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole	45.40813064575195
7103/28840	Arrived at Ryston DArtagnan assembled his	121.4508285522461
7104/28840	His face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole	153.0883026123047
7105/28840	The moment is at hand he	168.75074768066406
7106/28840	Yes returned DArtagnan who had overheard him tonight gentlemen we rescue the	61.07170104980469
7107/28840	DArtagnan said Athos this is no joke I trust It would quite cut me	45.6091194152832
7108/28840	You are a very odd man Athos he replied to doubt me	121.4276123046875
7109/28840	Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friends heart and a kings life I have told you and I repeat it that tonight we rescue Charles	96.00782775878906
7110/28840	You left it to me to discover the means and I have done	50.449378967285156
7111/28840	Porthos looked at DArtagnan with an expression of profound	12.39263916015625
7112/28840	Athos was pale and trembled in every	93.86734008789062
7113/28840	We are invited replied DArtagnan to pass the night with	39.033321380615234
7114/28840	But do you know where  	22.21056365966797
7115/28840	Groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him	114.35018157958984
7116/28840	Pardieu certainly all four we couldnt leave our prisoners could we   Ah ah said Aram	72.20061492919922
7117/28840	Tell us about it said Athos palpit	75.61354064941406
7118/28840	We are going then we two with our swords you with dag	253.70143127441406
7119/28840	We four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid	860.0388793945312
7120/28840	Monsieur Porthos what do you say to that   I say it is easy enough answered Porth	15.871456146240234
7121/28840	We dress the king in Groslows	267.2065124511719
7122/28840	Mousqueton Grimaud and Blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first	30.978246688842773
7123/28840	We mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues	436.2115478515625
7124/28840	Athos placed his two hands on DArtagnans shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad	82.80367279052734
7125/28840	I declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in	92.39955139160156
7126/28840	Whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you couldnt share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in	235.58839416503906
7127/28840	I repeat it DArtagnan you are the best one among us I bless and love you my dear	53.51851272583008
7128/28840	And to think that I couldnt find that out said Porthos scratching his head it is so	46.95876693725586
7129/28840	But said Aramis if I understand rightly we are to kill them all eh   Athos shuddered and turned	33.11040496826172
7130/28840	Mordioux answered DArtagnan I believe we	56.89789581298828
7131/28840	I confess I can discover no other safe and satisfactory	248.70069885253906
7132/28840	Let us see said Aramis how are we to act   I have arranged two	59.14566421508789
7133/28840	Firstly at a given signal which shall be the words At last you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to	131.37208557128906
7134/28840	We on our side do the	108.62846374511719
7135/28840	We shall then be matched four against the remaining	316.5291442871094
7136/28840	If these five men give themselves up we gag them if they resist we kill	289.668701171875
7137/28840	If by chance our Amphitryon changes his mind and receives only Porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of	162.78892517089844
7138/28840	It will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper	125.96009826660156
7139/28840	But if you yourselves should be struck said Ath	73.40040588378906
7140/28840	Impossible said DArtagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and	96.2441177368164
7141/28840	Besides you will strike at the throat Porthos it kills as quickly and prevents all	88.61386108398438
7142/28840	Very good said Porthos it will be a nice little throat	59.98970031738281
7143/28840	Nonsense said DArtagnan you would do as much	40.21846008300781
7144/28840	But if you think the kings life is not worth what it must cost theres an end of the matter and I send to Groslow to say I am	65.8706283569336
7145/28840	At this moment a soldier entered to inform them that Groslow was waiting for	54.773094177246094
7146/28840	In the room of the English Nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch Pur	66.96957397460938
7147/28840	Good replied Athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are	142.860107421875
7148/28840	The lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was	71.13542938232422
7149/28840	It was nine oclock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and Captain Groslow had been on guard for an	30.8482723236084
7150/28840	DArtagnan and Porthos armed with their swords and Athos and Aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was Charles Stuarts	60.59918212890625
7151/28840	The two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without	305.6029357910156
7152/28840	Ods bodikins said Groslow as the four friends entered I had almost given you	118.9825668334961
7153/28840	DArtagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear   The fact is we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I hesitated a	18.60436248779297
7154/28840	And why   DArtagnan looked significantly toward Athos and Aram	15.862131118774414
7155/28840	Aha said Groslow on account of political opinions No	142.87945556640625
7156/28840	On the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their Stuart they shall see	88.32775115966797
7157/28840	Are we to pass the night in the kings room asked DArtagn	22.63936424255371
7158/28840	No but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same	74.38995361328125
7159/28840	Have you provided yourself with money I assure you I intend to play the devils game	169.45814514160156
7160/28840	DArtagnan rattled the gold in his	35.06599807739258
7161/28840	Very good said Groslow and opened the door of the	19.329965591430664
7162/28840	I will show you the way and he went in	45.3234748840332
7163/28840	DArtagnan turned to look at his	14.85903263092041
7164/28840	Porthos was perfectly indifferent Athos pale but resolute Aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his	84.74649810791016
7165/28840	The eight guards were at their	441.9977722167969
7166/28840	Four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had	63.39396667480469
7167/28840	Athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good	109.85623168945312
7168/28840	A candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less	169.35089111328125
7169/28840	From time to time Parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but Charles would open his eyes and say with a smile   Go on my good Parry I am	70.8507308959961
7170/28840	Capital cried the Gascon you would make a distinguished	55.4429817199707
7171/28840	And do you think asked Groslow that Stuart will ever escape while I am on guard   No to be sure replied DArtagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon	62.607234954833984
7172/28840	It is impossible to say whether Charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the Puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of DArtagnans voice his eyelids rose in spite of	58.84648513793945
7173/28840	What are you thinking about said the king go on my good Parry unless you are	67.34003448486328
7174/28840	On a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two diceboxes and	234.2618408203125
7175/28840	Gentlemen said Groslow I beg you will take your	99.45005798339844
7176/28840	I will sit facing Stuart whom I like so much to see especially where he now is and you Monsieur dArtagnan opposite to	68.49066162109375
7177/28840	Thats it said DArtagnan you Monsieur le Comte de la Fere to the right of Monsieur Gros	9.049365997314453
7178/28840	Youll bet for me and those gentlemen for Monsieur Gros	51.08478546142578
7179/28840	By this arrangement DArtagnan could nudge Porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to Athos and Aram	33.466678619384766
7180/28840	At the names Comte de la Fere and Chevalier dHerblay Charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the	26.937517166137695
7181/28840	At that moment Parry turned over several leaves of his Bible and read with a loud voice this verse in Jeremiah   God said Hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom I have sent unto	98.70747375488281
7182/28840	The words that Parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real	125.24529266357422
7183/28840	You asked me just now if I was in funds said DArtagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the	48.99884796142578
7184/28840	Well in my turn I advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear Monsieur Groslow for I can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of	36.10565948486328
7185/28840	Not without my defending it said Gros	61.24115753173828
7186/28840	You know or you dont know that that is what we ask of	52.86063766479492
7187/28840	Oh yes said Groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh I know you Frenchmen want nothing but cuts and	105.95631408691406
7188/28840	Charles had heard and understood it	111.39875793457031
7189/28840	A slight color mounted to his	283.57257080078125
7190/28840	The soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the Scotch plaid which covered	312.0854797363281
7191/28840	Athos and Aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes	55.99318313598633
7192/28840	The luck had turned and Groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible	148.2088623046875
7193/28840	Porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned DArtagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the	67.35888671875
7194/28840	Athos and Aramis looked at him inquiring	31.048030853271484
7195/28840	They heard the guard going its	1022.4996948242188
7196/28840	How many rounds do they make a night asked DArtagnan drawing more pistoles from his	90.7398910522461
7197/28840	Five answered Groslow one every two	139.57171630859375
7198/28840	DArtagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first time replied to Porthoss nudge of the knee by a nudge	24.283645629882812
7199/28840	Those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the	99.06343078613281
7200/28840	The two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the	92.16865539550781
7201/28840	Athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment	629.1854858398438
7202/28840	With his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pew	115.0952377319336
7203/28840	Aramis less selfcontrolled fumbled continually with his hidden poni	281.94219970703125
7204/28840	Porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his	353.4560852050781
7205/28840	DArtagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see Parry standing up and Charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to	72.762451171875
7206/28840	DArtagnan saw that the moment was	20.44767189025879
7207/28840	He darted a preparatory glance at Athos and Aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for	85.44534301757812
7208/28840	He gave Porthos a second nudge of the knee and Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabb	44.31330871582031
7209/28840	Hang it cried DArtagnan another twenty pistoles	77.14618682861328
7210/28840	Really Captain Groslow you are too much in fortunes	115.83251953125
7211/28840	This cant last and he drew another twenty from his	272.6341857910156
7212/28840	One more turn captain twenty pistoles on one throwonly one the	536.1448364257812
7213/28840	And he turned up two cards as usual a king for DArtagnan and an ace for	73.76837158203125
7214/28840	A king said DArtagnan its a good omen Master Groslowlook out for the	94.27301788330078
7215/28840	And in spite of his extraordinary selfcontrol there was a strange vibration in the Gascons voice which made his partner	64.91423797607422
7216/28840	Groslow began turning the cards one after	550.3429565429688
7217/28840	If he turned up an ace first he won if a king he	220.1282501220703
7218/28840	At this word Athos and Aramis jumped	43.00566482543945
7219/28840	Daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and Harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large	110.03070068359375
7220/28840	Behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen	44.363487243652344
7221/28840	Groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and	154.48260498046875
7222/28840	But Harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the kings room followed by his companion   Charles Stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to London without stopping day or	109.64009857177734
7223/28840	Prepare yourself then to start at	340.1686706542969
7224/28840	And by whom is this order given asked the	171.91519165039062
7225/28840	Mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its	420.6174621582031
7226/28840	Mordaunt muttered the four friends exchanging	1218.868896484375
7227/28840	DArtagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost and buried it in his huge	46.29200744628906
7228/28840	Athos and Aramis placed themselves behind	68.65579223632812
7229/28840	At this movement Mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage	96.32101440429688
7230/28840	Im afraid we are prisoners whispered DArtagnan to his	43.21364212036133
7231/28840	Colonel colonel cried Mordaunt you are	202.11175537109375
7232/28840	These four Frenchmen have escaped from Newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the	89.47441864013672
7233/28840	Ah my young man said DArtagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than	86.23487091064453
7234/28840	Fly friends fly he added whirling his sword around	229.6469268798828
7235/28840	The next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their musk	68.71562957763672
7236/28840	Porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the	202.42723083496094
7237/28840	Fire cried Mordaunt fire upon them   Three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and	72.95982360839844
7238/28840	The horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their sadd	65.30714416503906
7239/28840	Forward cried DArtagnan and spur for your dear lives   They galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward	61.35111618041992
7240/28840	A few hundred yards beyond the town DArtagnan drew	90.8943099975586
7241/28840	Halt he cried this time we shall be	117.27555847167969
7242/28840	We must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite	104.93437194824219
7243/28840	There was a stream close by and a bridge across	248.238037109375
7244/28840	DArtagnan led his horse under the arch of the	37.56599807739258
7245/28840	Ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horse	66.97200775146484
7246/28840	A few minutes more and the troop passed over their	141.7487030029297
7247/28840	As soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance DArtagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward	54.155094146728516
7248/28840	This time said DArtagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot I think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach	45.79518508911133
7249/28840	What do you say Athos to that proposition Isnt it reasonable   Yes dear friend Athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonableit was noble and	99.8443374633789
7250/28840	You said Let us die here I recall to you that	112.50360870361328
7251/28840	Oh said Porthos death is nothing it isnt death that can disquiet us since we dont know what it	53.77302932739258
7252/28840	What troubles me is the idea of	422.3518981933594
7253/28840	As things are turning out I foresee that we must give battle to London to the provinces to all England and certainly in the end we cant fail to be	175.55728149414062
7254/28840	We ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said Ath	121.90298461914062
7255/28840	Whatever happens let us not leave England before the	201.5437469482422
7256/28840	Dont you agree with me Aramis   Entirely my dear	40.97555923461914
7257/28840	Then too I confess I should not be sorry to come across Mordaunt	53.84420394897461
7258/28840	It appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at	51.897010803222656
7259/28840	Ah thats another thing said DArtagnan and I should not mind waiting in London a whole year for a chance of meeting this Mordaunt in	81.93394470214844
7260/28840	Only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for I imagine just now that Noll Cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with	70.97418975830078
7261/28840	Athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin   I think I know what you want replied Ath	85.97132873535156
7262/28840	De Winter took us to the house of a Spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an Englishman by the guineas of his new compat	57.71316146850586
7263/28840	What do you say to it Aramis   Why the idea of taking quarters with Senor Perez seems to me very reasonable and for my part I agree to	69.32038879394531
7264/28840	You forget Aramis one precaution of considerable	268.28057861328125
7265/28840	What is that   The precaution of changing our	68.88391876220703
7266/28840	I dont see why we are very comfortable in those we	126.45026397705078
7267/28840	Our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the Frenchman at first	141.55160522460938
7268/28840	Now I dont set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at Tyburn or sent for change of scene to the	264.0265808105469
7269/28840	Ive remarked that your Puritans revel in that	414.73760986328125
7270/28840	But can you find your man said Aramis to Ath	43.20920944213867
7271/28840	He lives at the Bedford Tavern Greenhall	131.71914672851562
7272/28840	Besides I can find my way about the city with my eyes	114.22075653076172
7273/28840	I wish we were already there said DArtagnan and my advice is that we reach London before daybreak even if we kill our	58.21128845214844
7274/28840	Come on then said Athos for unless I am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to	60.145660400390625
7275/28840	The friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five oclock in the	43.52228927612305
7276/28840	They were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but Athos replied in excellent English that they had been sent forward by Colonel Harrison to announce to his colleague Monsieur Bridge the approach of the	59.62069320678711
7277/28840	That reply led to several questions about the kings capture and Athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished	249.96319580078125
7278/28840	The way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of Puritan	88.81085205078125
7279/28840	He went direct to the Bedford Tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising	103.81110382080078
7280/28840	Though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of Harrison and the	164.8982391357422
7281/28840	The plan of changing their clothes was unanimously	414.66131591796875
7282/28840	The landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his	196.61146545410156
7283/28840	Athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable	157.53594970703125
7284/28840	Aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a darkblue cloak of a military	138.70498657226562
7285/28840	Porthos was seduced by a winecolored doublet and seagreen bree	126.88616180419922
7286/28840	DArtagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar	99.4952163696289

7291/28840	After some discussion this was agreed to and Mousqueton played the role of bar	210.5828857421875
7292/28840	And smack of the Puritan to a frightful extent said Aram	73.45484924316406
7293/28840	My head feels actually cold said Porth	160.765380859375
7294/28840	As for me I feel anxious to preach a sermon said DArtagn	36.07441711425781
7295/28840	Now said Athos that we cannot even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the kings	78.1125717163086
7296/28840	They had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the kings	126.59789276123047
7297/28840	A carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic Porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage	101.0225830078125
7298/28840	DArtagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw Harrison at one window and Mordaunt at the	37.10193634033203
7299/28840	The next day Athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the Act of Parliament which summoned the exking Charles	90.07402038574219
7300/28840	Parliament can never have passed such an act as	252.17919921875
7301/28840	At this moment the landlord came	142.3026123046875
7302/28840	Did parliament pass this act Athos asked of him in	514.5238037109375
7303/28840	As to Porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast	116.82597351074219
7304/28840	You were asking then said the host in	139.35121154785156
7305/28840	Oh the devil said Porthos I am sorry for that it would have been one language	32.05923080444336
7306/28840	When I speak of the pure parliament resumed the host I mean the one which Colonel Bridge has we	159.78697204589844
7307/28840	Ah really said DArtagnan these people are very	48.34149932861328
7308/28840	When I go back to France I must suggest some such convenient course to Cardinal Mazarin and the coadj	66.15628051757812
7309/28840	One of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there wont be any parliament at	48.599666595458984
7310/28840	Now of two hundred and fiftyone members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninetyone who were in the way and might have upset his political	89.63126373291016
7311/28840	He took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the	66.77633666992188
7312/28840	Very   And all these one hundred and ninetyone were Royalists asked Ath	94.23831939697266
7313/28840	Without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the	74.72310638427734
7314/28840	To be sure said Porthos with majestic common sense they were in the	73.5877914428711
7315/28840	And you think said Aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal   He will be forced to do so smiled the Spani	55.58457565307617
7316/28840	But said Aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or	138.02047729492188
7317/28840	DArtagnan whistled a little air of incredul	44.843421936035156
7318/28840	We shall see said Athos for we shall go to the sittings I	71.3418197631836
7319/28840	You will not have long to wait said the landlord they begin	106.07925415039062
7320/28840	So then they drew up the indictments before the king was taken   Of course said DArtagnan they began the day he was	47.40911102294922
7321/28840	And you know said Aramis that it was our friend Mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the overt	76.56514739990234
7322/28840	And you know added DArtagnan that whenever I catch him I will kill him this Mord	47.69822311401367
7323/28840	Touching unanimity cried DArtagnan which well becomes good citizens like	177.70608520507812
7324/28840	Let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little	88.15565490722656
7325/28840	Yes said Porthos twill be at least a little change from	60.79579162597656
7326/28840	was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge	146.7188720703125
7327/28840	All London was crowding to the doors of the	121.61373901367188
7328/28840	The throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their	219.1622772216797
7329/28840	The judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his	170.656982421875
7330/28840	Charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over	102.92487335205078
7331/28840	Then when the officer was gone he sat down in the armchair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his	49.46699523925781
7332/28840	Parry who accompanied him stood behind	969.5087890625
7333/28840	DArtagnan was looking at Athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more selfcontrol had banished from his	53.70317077636719
7334/28840	This agitation in one so cold and calm as Athos frightened	193.8867950439453
7335/28840	I hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majestys example and not get killed for your folly in this	93.7519760131836
7336/28840	Set your mind at rest replied Ath	64.7021255493164
7337/28840	Aha continued DArtagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being	70.71224975585938
7338/28840	They had only halberds before now they have musk	88.82076263427734
7339/28840	The halberds were for the audience in the rear the muskets are for	50.46052932739258
7340/28840	Thirty forty fifty sixtyfive men said Porthos counting the	159.7562713623047
7341/28840	Ah said Aramis but you forget the	54.51224899291992
7342/28840	He recognized Mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the	123.26445007324219
7343/28840	Do you think they have recognized us said DArtagn	27.164548873901367
7344/28840	In that case I should beat a	64.73326110839844
7345/28840	I dont care to be shot in a	93.99374389648438
7346/28840	No said Aramis he has not seen	33.80912399291992
7347/28840	He sees no one but the	84.97130584716797
7348/28840	Mon Dieu how he stares at him the insolent dog Does he hate his majesty as much as he does us   Pardi answered Athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and	103.00543975830078
7349/28840	True said Aramis but silence the president is speaking to the	78.85952758789062
7350/28840	Stuart Bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to	277.22442626953125
7351/28840	The king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for	80.53423309326172
7352/28840	Bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of	89.5762710571289
7353/28840	Out of the hundred and sixtythree members designated there were only seventythree present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained	151.748046875
7354/28840	When the name of Colonel Fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the	120.04693603515625
7355/28840	Fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be	179.07875061035156
7356/28840	A loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weaknessa weakness which removes them beyond the power of	167.09352111816406
7357/28840	It is a womans voice cried Aramis faith I would give a good deal if she is young and	65.16436767578125
7358/28840	And he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of	86.39349365234375
7359/28840	By my soul said Aramis she is	52.63011932373047
7360/28840	Look DArtagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of Bradshaws gaze she has not turned	63.278690338134766
7361/28840	It is Lady Fairfax herself said DArtagn	42.128726959228516
7362/28840	Dont you remember Porthos we saw her at General Cromwells   The roll call	62.795387268066406
7363/28840	These rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force said the Comte de la F	52.10016632080078
7364/28840	Is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him Ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when I can cross something more than a look with	58.07155990600586
7365/28840	The king is really very handsome said Porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is	81.31012725830078
7366/28840	The feather in his hat is worth at least fiveandtwenty pist	61.34781265258789
7367/28840	The roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of	335.19744873046875
7368/28840	A second time he was disappointed in his	114.13636779785156
7369/28840	Notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in	326.76080322265625
7370/28840	I told you so Athos said DArtagnan shrugging his	10.66466999053955
7371/28840	Now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and	163.0655059814453
7372/28840	Never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly	782.86669921875
7373/28840	Charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty	207.85548400878906
7374/28840	The fact is said DArtagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves	158.70030212402344
7375/28840	But it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard	54.40766143798828
7376/28840	In any case Aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is The king can do no	179.6302032470703
7377/28840	Meantime DArtagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the	42.73575973510742
7378/28840	I must speak to him about	28.698549270629883
7379/28840	At this moment the accuser concluded with these words The present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the English	159.04946899414062
7380/28840	At these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a mans stout and furious thundered behind DArtagn	64.77275085449219
7381/28840	Ninetenths of the English people are horrified at what you	83.90254974365234
7382/28840	This voice was that of Athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public	63.844608306884766
7383/28840	King judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were	183.78335571289062
7384/28840	Mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other Frenchmen were standing pale and	189.98658752441406
7385/28840	He had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his	180.6824493408203
7386/28840	A movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were Fire on that bench he	92.70830535888672
7387/28840	Charles also had recognized the four French	104.89865112304688
7388/28840	He put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful	77.3760757446289
7389/28840	Mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd and then having found nothing	163.79461669921875
7390/28840	More than half an hour passed before any one could make himself	97.24093627929688
7391/28840	The judges were looking for a new outbreak from the	125.82058715820312
7392/28840	The spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and	231.1885223388672
7393/28840	What have you to say in your defense asked Bradshaw of the	63.003055572509766
7394/28840	Then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner Charles	138.52896118164062
7395/28840	Before questioning me he said reply to my	295.8359375
7396/28840	I was free at Newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both	241.1100311279297
7397/28840	Instead of performing your part of this contract as I performed mine you bought me from the Scotch cheaply I know and that does honor to the economic talent of your	145.18374633789062
7398/28840	But because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that I have ceased to be your king	91.29176330566406
7399/28840	To answer you would be to forget	96.13335418701172
7400/28840	I shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question	67.65742492675781
7401/28840	To answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and I only acknowledge you as my execution	98.53926086425781
7402/28840	And in the middle of a deathlike silence Charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm	112.66116333007812
7403/28840	Why are not my Frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when	89.96726989746094
7404/28840	Well said the president seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent so be	121.13665771484375
7405/28840	We will judge you in spite of your	122.16594696044922
7406/28840	You are accused of treason of abuse of power and	230.63720703125
7407/28840	Go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in	281.7977294921875
7408/28840	Charles rose and turned toward Parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with	113.3036117553711
7409/28840	Well my dear Parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner   Oh my king said Parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the	42.71261978149414
7410/28840	And why Parry   Do not look I implore you my	95.52191925048828
7411/28840	But what is the matter Speak said Charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded	93.46260833740234
7412/28840	It isbut you will not look will youit is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the	125.99632263183594
7413/28840	Fools said Charles do they take me for a coward like themselves You have done well to warn	187.1423797607422
7414/28840	When the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the	104.9546890258789
7415/28840	And shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed	38.20014190673828
7416/28840	When he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening	85.75641632080078
7417/28840	How many people thought he and not one true	515.0704956054688
7418/28840	And as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said   Respect to fallen	114.2169418334961
7419/28840	The king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and	123.39234924316406
7420/28840	It was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final	130.4388427734375
7421/28840	But the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of swordhilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized Captain Gros	119.5521240234375
7422/28840	Alas said Charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling	220.99351501464844
7423/28840	He continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the kings face as once an infamous and accursed Jew spit in the face of Jesus of Naz	113.38739013671875
7424/28840	Loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose	466.9597473144531
7425/28840	The crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of Ath	87.84819030761719
7426/28840	Charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile Poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own	77.46375274658203
7427/28840	Athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr	211.396484375
7428/28840	When the soldier saluted Charles Athoss heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the French gentleman had slipped into his	163.05360412597656
7429/28840	But when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch Athos grasped his	154.95350646972656
7430/28840	But DArtagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried Wait   Athos	23.628822326660156
7431/28840	DArtagnan leaning on Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several	43.78173828125
7432/28840	The man took his way toward the	58.84202194213867
7433/28840	The man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his	126.41932678222656
7434/28840	Arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the Frenchmen passed some jests from one to	139.8193817138672
7435/28840	I dont know English Athos said DArtagnan but you know it and will interpret for	30.93886947631836
7436/28840	You have befouled the face of your	622.1853637695312
7437/28840	Athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of	181.311279296875
7438/28840	Aramis at this movement drew his	204.77188110351562
7439/28840	And seizing the butcher by the throat   Porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single	60.4257698059082
7440/28840	Porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulters skull and crushed	175.25225830078125
7441/28840	The man fell like an ox beneath the pole	124.68533325195312
7442/28840	His companions horrorstruck could neither move nor cry	391.5787658691406
7443/28840	Tell them this Athos resumed DArtagnan thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the	121.41563415527344
7444/28840	The fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming	241.0902557373047
7445/28840	Justice is done said Porthos wiping his	49.335052490234375
7446/28840	And now said DArtagnan to Athos entertain no further doubts about me I undertake all that concerns the	68.8823471069336
7447/28840	The parliament condemned Charles to death as might have been fore	283.0837707519531

7451/28840	DArtagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dénouement of the bloody	91.36618041992188
7452/28840	But by what means As yet he could form no definite plan all must depend on	303.0118103027344
7453/28840	Meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following daythe day appointed by the	62.22146987915039
7454/28840	The only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the London execution	123.66956329345703

7457/28840	DArtagnan took upon himself that more than difficult	88.38568115234375
7458/28840	Another thing not less essential was to warn Charles Stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their	122.60655975341797
7459/28840	Charles Stuart had asked that Bishop Juxon might be permitted to visit	110.44654846191406
7460/28840	Mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of Cromwells	187.30226135253906

7468/28840	At times he thought of those brave French gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal like the forms that appear in	111.51919555664062
7469/28840	In fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a	61.70930099487305
7470/28840	He rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window he saw glittering below him the muskets of the	42.16719436645508
7471/28840	He was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was	171.54481506347656

7476/28840	A neighboring church clock slowly struck the	2079.321044921875
7477/28840	The flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty	414.60711669921875
7478/28840	These were the ancestors of Charles standing back dimly in their tarnished	259.5765075683594
7479/28840	An awful sadness enveloped the heart of	339.8025817871094
7480/28840	That king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered	100.57705688476562
7481/28840	Suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious	115.50373840332031

7487/28840	At this sight and this voice Charles was about to cry out when Aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of	60.276065826416016
7488/28840	Yes sire interrupted Aramis raising his voice Bishop Juxon the faithful knight of Christ obedient to your majestys	71.52981567382812
7489/28840	Charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a	80.86779022216797

7495/28840	The king looked at Aramis with aston	38.366065979003906
7496/28840	At this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the	66.13906860351562
7497/28840	I hear said Aramis but I understand neither the noise nor the cry of	60.454498291015625

7503/28840	My king said Aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they cannot make an execution	74.8293228149414
7504/28840	What do you mean asked the	19.58631134033203
7505/28840	I mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or	57.69794464111328

7507/28840	How can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of	41.930633544921875
7508/28840	Oh sir cried Parry may you and yours be blessed   How can it be repeated the	83.62539672851562
7509/28840	I must know so that I may assist you if there is any	33.97330093383789
7510/28840	I know nothing about it continued Aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when I left him Tell the king that tomorrow at ten oclock at night we shall carry him	68.84921264648438
7511/28840	He has said it and will do	104.03082275390625

7521/28840	At this moment a man entered without even knocking at the	61.727046966552734
7522/28840	Aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held	96.94939422607422
7523/28840	The man was one of those Puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around Crom	185.89208984375
7524/28840	What do you want sir said the	19.442384719848633
7525/28840	I desire to know if the confession of Charles Stuart is at an end said the	52.205570220947266

7532/28840	Chevalier said the king when the door was closed I believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil	46.52052307128906
7533/28840	Take care that no misfortune befalls you when you	213.0662841796875

7535/28840	Go then sir and God keep you   The king accompanied him to the door where Aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the anterooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishops	69.63133239746094
7536/28840	Everything has succeeded as I expected spies guards satellites all took me for you and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless	117.97041320800781

7538/28840	Aramis resumed his own attire and left Juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to	57.0689697265625
7539/28840	He had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large	28.73756980895996
7540/28840	He placed his hand on his dagger and	45.4142951965332
7541/28840	You see we had each our mission said Porthos mine was to guard you and I am doing	119.90025329589844
7542/28840	Have you seen the king   Yes and all goes	59.63055419921875
7543/28840	We are to meet our friends at the hotel at	127.3984603881836
7544/28840	It was then striking halfpast ten by	124.23027038574219
7545/28840	Arrived at the hotel it was not long before Athos	140.50450134277344
7546/28840	Alls well he cried as he entered I have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any	194.22378540039062
7547/28840	It is waiting for us at Greenwich opposite the Isle of Dogs manned by a captain and four men who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive	84.70775604248047

7552/28840	The sum was collected in a	274.989013671875
7553/28840	DArtagnan ran out and returned directly	92.80326080322266
7554/28840	Ough and not without a deal of trouble	535.0277099609375
7555/28840	Has the executioner left London asked Ath	77.22318267822266
7556/28840	Ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return by	127.03333282470703
7557/28840	Where is he then   In the	44.34978485107422

7560/28840	Bravo said Aramis how did you manage it   Like everything else with money but it cost me	78.52167510986328
7561/28840	And where did you get so much money said Ath	58.641048431396484
7562/28840	Had you then that sum   The queens famous diamond answered DArtagnan with a	47.917606353759766
7563/28840	You bought it back then from Monsieur des Essarts asked Porth	24.983495712280273
7564/28840	Yes but it was fated that I should not keep	46.988826751708984
7565/28840	So then we are all right as regards the executioner said Athos but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call	101.94218444824219
7566/28840	And this one had his said DArtagnan but as good luck would have it just as I thought I should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken	75.3941421508789
7567/28840	In the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the kings window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke	80.65068054199219
7568/28840	Ah cried Aramis that accounts for the cry I	119.2524185180664
7569/28840	Heres the letter he sent by a messenger for sixpence who sold it to me for a gu	118.70330047607422
7570/28840	And what on earth are you going to do with it asked Ath	37.00067901611328

7572/28840	The letter from the executioners assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he	214.66387939453125
7573/28840	Toward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his	787.4793090820312
7574/28840	It arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saw	219.718017578125
7575/28840	Lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his	164.34498596191406
7576/28840	He could not endure it and sent Parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their	83.5632553100586
7577/28840	The sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed Parry to	138.6267547607422
7578/28840	Arriving at the window Parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black ser	198.92166137695312
7579/28840	Raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower	101.47282409667969
7580/28840	Parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron	154.11883544921875
7581/28840	My friends said Parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly The king wishes to get a	166.82220458984375
7582/28840	One of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of	125.66595458984375
7583/28840	The face of the first was lost to Parry in the darkness but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips Parry started back in amaz	52.23617172241211
7584/28840	Very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent	156.99041748046875
7585/28840	Tell the king that if he sleeps badly tonight he will sleep better tomorrow	196.71499633789062
7586/28840	These blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of	229.84312438964844
7587/28840	But Parry withdrew thinking he was	186.38726806640625
7588/28840	At the moment he reentered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was	48.175575256347656

7592/28840	The king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in	80.01431274414062
7593/28840	It was Athos he had recognized and Porthos who was boring a hole through the	38.601905822753906
7594/28840	This hole communicated with a kind of loftthe space between the floor of the kings room and the ceiling of the one below	106.9148178100586
7595/28840	Their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the kings room so as to form a kind of trap	78.57205200195312
7596/28840	Day gilded the tops of the	115.3683853149414
7597/28840	The aperture was finished and Athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the kings	106.14588928222656
7598/28840	He had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to	75.91354370117188
7599/28840	DArtagnan returned to change his workmans clothes for his chestnutcolored suit and Porthos to put on his red double	47.09490203857422
7600/28840	As for Aramis he went off to the bishops palace to see if he could possibly pass in with Juxon to the kings	54.52591323852539
7601/28840	All three agreed to meet at noon in Whitehall Place to see how things went	257.42266845703125
7602/28840	Before leaving the scaffold Aramis had approached the opening where Athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the	35.350563049316406
7603/28840	Adieu then and be of good courage said Ath	153.0003662109375
7604/28840	Report to the king the condition of	117.92064666748047

7611/28840	Be easy said Aramis I will take two poniards and give one to Par	50.26597213745117
7612/28840	Is that all   Yes go but urge the king strongly not to stand on false	190.31137084960938
7613/28840	While you are fighting if there is a fight he must	133.2621612548828
7614/28840	The trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has	132.24822998046875
7615/28840	In those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be	66.24119567871094
7616/28840	Everything shall be done as you say Ath	43.27450180053711
7617/28840	Your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other	90.88724517822266
7618/28840	Athos put his arm around Aramiss neck and embraced	216.6739501953125
7619/28840	Now if I die say to DArtagnan that I love him as a son and embrace him for	48.62477111816406
7620/28840	Embrace also our good and brave Porth	190.3316192626953
7621/28840	I am as sure now that the king will be saved as I am sure that I clasp the most loyal hand in the	48.25461959838867
7622/28840	Aramis parted from Athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of Crom	45.93273162841797
7623/28840	He found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold	143.49209594726562
7624/28840	Porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians DArtagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious	88.96945190429688
7625/28840	Aramis related what had been agreed	230.70452880859375
7626/28840	DArtagnan approved with a movement of the head and Porthos with his	21.021209716796875
7627/28840	Bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the	85.44917297363281
7628/28840	What with DArtagnan Grimaud and Mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of	49.352500915527344
7629/28840	I say nothing about Blaisois for he is only fit to hold the	54.843605041503906
7630/28840	Two minutes a man makes four	1176.3973388671875
7631/28840	Mousqueton will lose another thats five and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a	91.84440612792969
7632/28840	Aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his	91.97662353515625
7633/28840	Now said he Im off to the	183.16455078125
7634/28840	Grimaud has relieved Mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar	243.67929077148438
7635/28840	I pass my life upon my	201.03924560546875
7636/28840	Aramis again presented himself at the	173.58355712890625
7637/28840	Juxon consented the more readily to take him with him as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to	98.51972198486328
7638/28840	Dressed as Aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacons dress got in by his	89.7327880859375
7639/28840	The carriage stopped at the door of the	24.366283416748047
7640/28840	It was about nine oclock in the	10.356731414794922
7641/28840	The anterooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by	354.748291015625
7642/28840	The king was already sanguine but when he perceived Aramis his hope turned to	194.26454162597656
7643/28840	He embraced Juxon and pressed the hand of Aram	43.982540130615234
7644/28840	The bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous	126.47492218017578
7645/28840	The king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same	241.15060424804688
7646/28840	Juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the	113.52912902832031
7647/28840	As soon as the door was closed   Sire said Aramis speaking rapidly you are saved the London executioner has	56.41267395019531
7648/28840	His assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majestys windowthe cry we heard was hisand there is no executioner nearer at hand than	191.2442626953125
7649/28840	But the Comte de la Fere asked the	6.852329254150391
7650/28840	Two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the	202.40455627441406
7651/28840	The king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the	307.4104309082031
7652/28840	So said Charles he who knocks down there   Is the Comte de la Fere sire said Aram	19.688779830932617
7653/28840	He is preparing a way for your majesty to	65.51681518554688
7654/28840	Parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be	328.6269836425781
7655/28840	Sire replied Juxon you shall be ob	50.99420166015625
7656/28840	Meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the	186.77517700195312
7657/28840	Aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop the noise came nearer and	181.6088409423828
7658/28840	It was that of a number of men steadily	95.2566909790039
7659/28840	All eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemn	29.92074203491211
7660/28840	A parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their	266.8734130859375
7661/28840	What is this said Aramis to Jux	30.142683029174805
7662/28840	Juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis about	75.07070922851562
7663/28840	Then it is for today asked the	60.629791259765625
7664/28840	Was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning   Then I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the London executioner   The London executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his services	54.81589126586914
7665/28840	The execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal	328.979736328125
7666/28840	A slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that Charles evinced as he learned these tid	99.91183471679688
7667/28840	His heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the	108.53614807128906
7668/28840	Charles perceived it and took his	81.84667205810547
7669/28840	There is but little reason why I should delay	83.84947967529297
7670/28840	Firstly I wish to communicate secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last	109.36925506591797
7671/28840	Will this be permitted me   Certainly replied the officer and left the	57.29375076293945
7672/28840	Aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned	266.0472412109375
7673/28840	Oh my lord bishop he cried seizing Juxons hands where is Providence where is Providence   My son replied the bishop with firmness you see Him not because the passions of the world conceal	163.80335998535156
7674/28840	My son said the king to Aramis do not take it so to	80.78242492675781
7675/28840	God beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their	199.718017578125
7676/28840	Ascribe to men then what is happening and not to	453.55474853515625
7677/28840	It is men who drive me to death it is men who make you	131.11569213867188
7678/28840	Yes sire said Aramis yes you are	23.815048217773438
7679/28840	It is men whom I should hold responsible and I will hold them	117.07481384277344
7680/28840	Be seated Juxon said the king falling upon his	71.37887573242188
7681/28840	I have now to confess to	57.102638244628906
7682/28840	Remain sir he added to Aramis who had moved to leave the	50.194091796875
7683/28840	I have nothing to say that cannot be said before	68.6868667602539
7684/28840	Juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his	174.60372924804688
7685/28840	Remember     The mob had already assembled when the confession	45.80793762207031
7686/28840	The kings children next arrivedthe Princess Charlotte a beautiful fairhaired child with tears in her eyes and the Duke of Gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing	245.03907775878906
7687/28840	He had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the	208.50457763671875
7688/28840	Charless heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of	50.89350891113281
7689/28840	He turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and	129.2675323486328
7690/28840	Then he took the boy upon his	95.08379364013672
7691/28840	My son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came	60.62030792236328
7692/28840	These men are going to behead your	92.63773345947266
7693/28840	Perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the Prince of Wales or the Duke of York your elder	93.11039733886719
7694/28840	But you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are	68.74371337890625
7695/28840	Swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the	158.76873779296875
7696/28840	For one daylisten my sonone day if you do so they will doom you to destruction head and crown too and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience as I	100.29937744140625
7697/28840	The child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said I swear to your	66.87792205810547
7698/28840	Henry said Charles call me your	165.67718505859375
7699/28840	Father replied the child I swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me	125.88966369628906
7700/28840	Now kiss me and you too	316.9024658203125
7701/28840	Oh never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their fathers	285.6117858886719
7702/28840	Take them away Juxon their tears will deprive me of the courage to	181.25750732421875
7703/28840	Juxon led them away and this time the doors were left	145.41175842285156
7704/28840	Meanwhile Athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his	184.1818084716797
7705/28840	Two long hours he waited in terrible	847.2608642578125
7706/28840	A deathlike silence reigned in the room	154.03126525878906
7707/28840	At last he determined to discover the cause of this still	115.69109344482422
7708/28840	He crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaff	77.34298706054688
7709/28840	Peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the	65.39141082763672
7710/28840	What is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the windswayed cloth he was holding	123.20709991455078
7711/28840	The people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators I see DArtagn	54.848026275634766
7712/28840	What is he waiting for What is he looking at Good God have they allowed the headsman to escape   Suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the	147.17250061035156
7713/28840	The sound of heavy steps was heard above his	201.06561279296875
7714/28840	The next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then	88.21330261230469
7715/28840	At the same moment a wellknown voice above him pronounced these words   Colonel I want to speak to the	47.08212661743164
7716/28840	It was the king speaking on the scaff	49.55997085571289
7717/28840	In fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread Charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for	138.60369873046875
7718/28840	Then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the execution	84.84660339355469
7719/28840	He approached the block and laid his axe upon	181.04010009765625
7720/28840	Behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was Charles Stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaff	116.71094512939453
7721/28840	The sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged	196.64962768554688
7722/28840	Every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following	133.89273071289062
7723/28840	But they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his	69.13417053222656
7724/28840	The kings request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of Athoss heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the	166.09901428222656
7725/28840	Do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his	129.5236358642578
7726/28840	At the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the	69.36003112792969
7727/28840	Then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied Jux	51.74897766113281
7728/28840	Then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of Henrietta	76.96060943603516
7729/28840	Sir said he to the priest I shall keep this cross in my hand till the last	56.036800384521484
7730/28840	Take it from me when I am	54.994239807128906
7731/28840	Yes sire said a voice which Athos recognized as that of Aram	38.52089309692383
7732/28840	He then took his hat from his head and threw it on the	24.044095993041992
7733/28840	One by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his	70.52250671386719
7734/28840	Then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to	55.740562438964844
7735/28840	All the preparations were made with a frightful calm	73.73689270019531
7736/28840	One would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his	50.980255126953125
7737/28840	Will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if so they can be tied	125.39216613769531
7738/28840	Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown heads	88.48524475097656
7739/28840	His calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his	196.2838897705078
7740/28840	But after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of Aram	76.32209014892578
7741/28840	The king seeing that he did not reply repeated his	107.20406341552734
7742/28840	It will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the	71.44054412841797
7743/28840	The king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said   This block is very low is there no other to be had   It is the usual block answered the man in the	65.33808135986328
7744/28840	Do you think you can behead me with a single blow asked the	52.40766143798828
7745/28840	There was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shudd	112.31027221679688
7746/28840	I do not wish to be taken by surprise added the	34.635047912597656
7747/28840	I shall kneel down to pray do not strike	237.5064697265625
7748/28840	When shall I strike   When I shall lay my head on the block and say Remember then strike	175.06765747070312
7749/28840	Gentlemen said the king to those around him I leave you to brave the tempest I go before you to a kingdom which knows no	148.69827270507812
7750/28840	He looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his	31.46157455444336
7751/28840	Now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer I beseech	45.070716857910156
7752/28840	You also stand aside he said to the masked	209.7421875
7753/28840	It is only for a moment and I know that I belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till I give the	39.77568817138672
7754/28840	Then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in French Comte de la Fere are you there   Yes your majesty he answered	31.0737361907959
7755/28840	Faithful friend noble heart said the king I should not have been	84.1370849609375
7756/28840	I have addressed my people and I have spoken to God last of all I speak to	66.76971435546875
7757/28840	To maintain a cause which I believed sacred I have lost the throne and my children their	238.03604125976562
7758/28840	A million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of Newcastle	359.9262390136719
7759/28840	You only know that this money	196.23194885253906
7760/28840	Make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest sons	87.6935043334961
7761/28840	Farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped Athos chilled with	754.9868774414062
7762/28840	A moments silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed Remember   He had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where Athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his	93.46478271484375
7763/28840	He reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson catar	184.9627227783203
7764/28840	Athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or	116.21935272216797
7765/28840	At last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred	72.60872650146484
7766/28840	Then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the	45.94699478149414
7767/28840	Having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarchs blood fell down ins	75.2017593383789
7768/28840	The snow was falling thick and	1181.0692138671875
7769/28840	Aramis was the next to come in and to discover Athos almost ins	98.67477416992188
7770/28840	But at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had	31.531036376953125
7771/28840	Well said Aramis beaten by fate   Beaten said Ath	105.4647445678711
7772/28840	Noble and unhappy king   Are you wounded cried Aram	75.9733657836914
7773/28840	Where were you then   Where you left meunder the scaff	74.02581024169922
7774/28840	Did you see it all   No but I heard	33.8744010925293
7775/28840	God preserve me from another such hour as I have just	311.27325439453125
7776/28840	Then you know that I did not leave him   I heard your voice up to the last	33.503746032714844
7777/28840	Here is the order he gave me and the cross I took from his hand he desired they should be returned to the	66.10690307617188
7778/28840	Then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied Athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the kings	42.87489700317383
7779/28840	And what he continued has been done with the poor body   By order of Cromwell royal honors will be accorded to	86.3475341796875
7780/28840	The doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted	169.92745971679688
7781/28840	Mockery muttered Athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered   Well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which Porthos had just	127.27186584472656
7782/28840	We are all mortal my poor	192.41380310058594
7783/28840	Yes there were some people on the way who delayed	113.92191314697266
7784/28840	I took one of them by the throat and threequarters throttled	71.99540710449219
7785/28840	Luckily the man I had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so I took advantage of his silence to walk	101.8581771850586
7786/28840	Have you seen DArtagnan   We got separated in the crowd and I could not find him	43.15251541137695
7787/28840	Oh said Athos satirically I saw	35.419227600097656
7788/28840	He was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the	114.25147247314453
7789/28840	They were anxious about you here I simply told them where you	199.50473022460938
7790/28840	You didnt know King Charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love	87.2774658203125
7791/28840	So saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his	81.51258087158203
7792/28840	Ugh I am tired cried DArtagnan sitting	66.57162475585938
7793/28840	Drink a glass of port said Aramis it will refresh	130.8920440673828
7794/28840	Yes let us drink said Athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with DArtagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful	59.54244613647461
7795/28840	The felucca is waiting for us you know let us leave tonight we have nothing more to do	45.561561584472656
7796/28840	You are in a hurry sir count said DArtagn	19.606843948364258
7797/28840	Every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his	236.12350463867188
7798/28840	Ah you remain in London said Porth	39.41158676147461
7799/28840	And you   Hang it said Porthos a little perplexed between the two I suppose as I came with you I must go away with	46.250579833984375
7800/28840	I cant leave you alone in this abominable	158.71734619140625
7801/28840	So I have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is	48.517616271972656
7802/28840	I want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the kings	86.7230224609375
7803/28840	A man in a mask cried Ath	80.33537292480469
7804/28840	You did not let the executioner escape then   The executioner is still in the cellar where I presume he has had an interview with mine hosts	66.20330810546875
7805/28840	Mousqueton   Sir answered a voice from the depths of the	41.586429595947266
7806/28840	But said Athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king   An amateur headsman replied Aramis who however does not handle the axe am	80.01332092285156
7807/28840	Did you not see his face asked Ath	46.07643127441406
7808/28840	But you Aramis who were close to him   I could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the	41.53963851928711
7809/28840	Then it must be a man of a certain	36.43484115600586
7810/28840	When one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under	128.40579223632812
7811/28840	I am sorry I did not follow him said Porth	23.902809143066406
7812/28840	Well my dear Porthos said DArtagnan thats the very thing it came into my head to	25.83884620666504
7813/28840	I have distrusted God I could the more easily distrust	138.54376220703125
7814/28840	We will see about that presently said DArtagnan with a slight	40.41941452026367
7815/28840	I was looking around for Porthos when I saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black	104.44979095458984
7816/28840	Humph thought I that looks like my handiwork I fancy I must have mended that skull somewhere or	521.8511352539062
7817/28840	And in fact it was that unfortunate Scotchman Parrys brother you know on whom Groslow amused himself by trying his	121.73482513427734
7818/28840	Well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around I recognized the honest Grim	145.34658813476562
7819/28840	Grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the	170.79969787597656
7820/28840	Eh said he which meant Do you see him Parbleu I answered and we perfectly understood one	173.70370483398438
7821/28840	Well everything was finished as you	156.6880645751953
7822/28840	I made a sign to Grimaud and the Scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the	35.36227035522461
7823/28840	I saw the executioner return into the kings room change his clothes put on a black hat and a large cloak and	71.56393432617188
7824/28840	Five minutes later he came down the grand	148.05648803710938
7825/28840	I should think so but not without	123.8817367553711
7826/28840	Every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal	151.50865173339844
7827/28840	I might have gone up to him and killed	38.76053237915039
7828/28840	But I am not selfish and I thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the	53.286903381347656
7829/28840	So we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hours time he stopped before a little isolated	116.19929504394531
7830/28840	The man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being	74.21086120605469
7831/28840	Grimaud and I got behind a tree and the Scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the	100.19316864013672
7832/28840	Next moment the door opened and the man	52.688873291015625
7833/28840	While you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find	89.3199691772461
7834/28840	Come now Aramis said DArtagnan you must be taking me for some one	25.444984436035156
7835/28840	Nevertheless said Athos in your absence   Well in my absence havent I put in my place Grimaud and the Scotchman Before he had taken ten steps beyond the door I had examined the house on all	59.27358627319336
7836/28840	At one of the doors that by which he had entered I placed our Scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out	69.4308090209961
7837/28840	Then going around the house I placed Grimaud at the other exit and here I	97.96632385253906
7838/28840	Friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me I was wrong a hundred times	97.35270690917969
7839/28840	I ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us	96.39449310302734
7840/28840	Dont you think the executioner might be Master Cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself   Ah just	109.6727294921875
7841/28840	Cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than	431.33782958984375
7842/28840	Some condemned soldier perhaps suggested Athos whom they have pardoned at the price of reg	146.14825439453125
7843/28840	No no continued DArtagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horse	57.998558044433594
7844/28840	If I am not mistaken we have to do with a	25.047639846801758
7845/28840	Impossible It would be a dishonor to all the	186.12722778320312
7846/28840	Fine sport by Jove cried Porthos with a laugh that shook the	55.038570404052734
7847/28840	Fine sport   Are you still bent on departure Athos asked DArtagn	48.95014953613281
7848/28840	No I remain replied Athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was	122.664794921875
7849/28840	Swords then cried Aramis swords let us not lose a	90.96846008300781
7850/28840	The four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered Mousqueton and Blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their	100.32583618164062
7851/28840	The night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and	297.37457275390625
7852/28840	DArtagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in	51.05726623535156
7853/28840	For a moment DArtagnan thought that Parrys brother had disappeared but he was	44.94561004638672
7854/28840	The robust Scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched himself against a post and like a fallen statue insensible to the inclemency of the weather had allowed the snow to cover	208.98146057128906
7855/28840	Come said Athos heres another good	137.74288940429688
7856/28840	Really honest men are not so scarce as I	65.85420989990234
7857/28840	Dont be in a hurry to weave crowns for our Scotch	83.95758056640625
7858/28840	I believe the fellow is here on his own account for I have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the Tweed are very vind	77.13504791259766
7859/28840	I should not like to be Groslow if he meets	58.2145881652832
7860/28840	Well said Athos to the man in	48.45393371582031
7861/28840	No one has come out he	159.9502716064453
7862/28840	Well has anybody come out   No but somebody has gone	167.2512664794922
7863/28840	A man or a woman   A	59.240779876708984
7864/28840	Ah ah said DArtagnan there are two of them then   I wish there were four said Athos the two parties would then be	50.65812683105469
7865/28840	What do you mean   Other men may have entered before them and waited for	57.126365661621094
7866/28840	At the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light	51.40937423706055
7867/28840	That is true said DArtagnan let us call the	21.98731231689453
7868/28840	They returned around the house to fetch Porthos and Aram	33.694984436035156
7869/28840	No but we are going to replied DArtagnan pointing to Grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the	34.22307205200195
7870/28840	Grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when	188.77886962890625
7871/28840	Then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was	91.37506866455078
7872/28840	Grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread	884.6988525390625
7873/28840	Speak said Athos we cannot see your	164.4491729736328
7874/28840	How many are there  	177.0594482421875
7875/28840	One opposite to me the other with his back to	78.86517333984375
7876/28840	And the man opposite to you is   The man I saw go	83.07707977294922
7877/28840	Do you know him   I thought I recognized him and was not	35.41982650756836
7878/28840	Who is it they all asked together in a low	102.66655731201172
7879/28840	The four friends looked at one	124.04866027832031
7880/28840	The executioner said DArtagnan and Aramis at the same	11.014532089233398
7881/28840	I can see nothing but his back resumed Grim	57.200828552246094
7882/28840	He is moving and if he has taken off his mask I shall be able to	32.97650146484375
7883/28840	Ah   And as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a gro	54.866703033447266
7884/28840	Did you see him they all	129.3313446044922
7885/28840	Yes said Grimaud with his hair standing on	69.30901336669922
7886/28840	The thin spare man  	225.2879638671875
7887/28840	Heheis murmured Grimaud pale as a ghost and seizing his masters	92.53269958496094
7888/28840	DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis uttered a cry of	5.9204182624816895
7889/28840	Athos stepped back and passed his hand across his	70.9183349609375
7890/28840	It was in fact Mordaunt whom DArtagnan had followed without knowing	39.6613655090332
7891/28840	On entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a	98.8150863647461
7892/28840	Cromwell had two or three of these retreats in London unknown except to the most intimate of his	94.83529663085938
7893/28840	General I wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed	56.694068908691406
7894/28840	Ah I scarcely thought you were so curious as	107.51710510253906
7895/28840	I am always curious to see the downfall of your honors enemies and he was not among the least of	76.67584228515625
7896/28840	But you general were you not at Whitehall   No said Crom	52.665489196777344
7897/28840	Have you had any account of it  	62.90156555175781
7898/28840	I have been here since the	21.425397872924805
7899/28840	I only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the	60.40055847167969
7900/28840	Four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to Greenwich where a vessel was	107.43019104003906
7901/28840	And knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and	250.47564697265625
7902/28840	But who told you I was inactive   Butif the plot had succeeded   I wished it to do	68.88129425048828
7903/28840	I thought your excellence considered the death of Charles	272.2270812988281
7904/28840	as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of	196.11642456054688
7905/28840	Yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaff	88.32096862792969
7906/28840	Because it could have been said that I had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of	79.2242202758789
7907/28840	But if he had escaped   Impossible my precautions were	130.12313842773438
7908/28840	And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him   The four Frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by Mazarin to	62.550479888916016
7909/28840	And do you think Mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done   It is	47.54547882080078
7910/28840	How so   Because they	60.015628814697266
7911/28840	Your honor gave me two of these Frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for Charles	90.59760284423828
7912/28840	Now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against England will your honor give me all four of them   Take them said Crom	77.41552734375
7913/28840	Mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant fer	182.46871948242188
7914/28840	Did the people shout at all Cromwell	284.98980712890625
7915/28840	Very little except Long live Cromwell   Where were you placed   Mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the generals face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew	95.51731872558594
7916/28840	But his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of Cromwell	82.17018127441406
7917/28840	I was so situated as to hear and see everything he	117.88966369628906
7918/28840	It was now Cromwells turn to look fixedly at Mordaunt and Mordaunt to make himself impenetr	52.49038314819336
7919/28840	It appears said Cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably	116.70359802246094
7920/28840	The blow so they tell me at least was struck with a masters	117.82588958740234
7921/28840	Mordaunt remembered that Cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or	135.07528686523438
7922/28840	In fact said Mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow suffic	42.096466064453125
7923/28840	Perhaps it was some one in that occupation said Crom	60.1420783996582
7924/28840	Do you think so sir He did not look like an execution	55.87257766723633
7925/28840	And who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office   But said Mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this	59.10044479370117
7926/28840	And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action   It is not for me to	69.96244812011719
7927/28840	It rests between his conscience and his	371.0550231933594
7928/28840	But if your honor knew this man   I neither know nor wish to know	58.65430450439453
7929/28840	Provided Charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must	191.00047302246094
7930/28840	And yet without the man the king would have been	92.50182342529297
7931/28840	They would have carried him to Greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the	57.68696594238281
7932/28840	Once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest Mord	81.77578735351562
7933/28840	Yes they would have all been blown	127.92172241210938
7934/28840	The explosion would have done what the axe had failed to	167.8977813720703
7935/28840	Men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by	102.4029312133789
7936/28840	You see now why I did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions I could not thank him for what he has	84.62010192871094
7937/28840	Sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was	116.63194274902344
7938/28840	Say absurd since it has become	370.5827331542969
7939/28840	The only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear	750.08056640625
7940/28840	So tonight Mordaunt go to Greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca	78.05842590332031
7941/28840	Oh my lord my lord   That title said Cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in	63.276161193847656
7942/28840	But your honor will soon be called so	154.2775115966797
7943/28840	I hope so at least said Cromwell rising and putting on his	68.84616088867188
7944/28840	You are going sir   Yes said Crom	24.733354568481445
7945/28840	I slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same	70.62439727783203
7946/28840	Then said Mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for tonight   And even for all day tomorrow if you want	85.28760528564453
7947/28840	Since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that I should give you	66.34362030029297
7948/28840	Thank you sir it will be well employed I	113.03746795654297
7949/28840	And no one waiting for you outside  	56.38435363769531
7950/28840	Then you had better come with	104.58838653564453
7951/28840	Thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and I have none to	51.524654388427734
7952/28840	Cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered	63.14031982421875
7953/28840	It closed after him with a	90.923095703125
7954/28840	This door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future	51.09825897216797
7955/28840	It was just before this that Grimaud had perceived the two men seated	85.47374725341797
7956/28840	DArtagnan was the first to recover from his	22.759525299072266
7957/28840	Ah by Heaven it is God Himself who sent us	242.10067749023438
7958/28840	Yes said Porthos let us break the door in and fall upon	34.678897857666016
7959/28840	Now Grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if Mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to	71.41442108154297
7960/28840	If he comes out we shall catch	89.89676666259766
7961/28840	If he stays in we will break in the	152.87362670898438
7962/28840	It is easier and less noisy than the	134.4657440185547
7963/28840	Grimaud began to scale the wall	684.8521118164062
7964/28840	Keep guard at the other door Athos and Aram	24.801984786987305
7965/28840	We did not see his companion come	84.71097564697266
7966/28840	He may have gone by the other	86.42498016357422
7967/28840	What is he doing   Putting on his cloak and	49.793331146240234
7968/28840	Porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabb	57.245033264160156
7969/28840	Put it up again my friend said DArtagn	18.019100189208984
7970/28840	We must proceed in an orderly	189.8237762451172
7971/28840	Hush said Grimaud he is coming	61.5477294921875
7972/28840	He has put out the lamp I can see nothing	113.2834701538086
7973/28840	The snow deadened the noise of his	390.7772521972656
7974/28840	Now go and tell Athos and Aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch	42.33309555053711
7975/28840	The next moment the door opened and Mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with DArtagn	27.917125701904297
7976/28840	Porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running	165.87266540527344
7977/28840	Mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for	373.58526611328125
7978/28840	DArtagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on Mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no	90.74961853027344
7979/28840	At last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before Mordaunt had been talking to Crom	84.69123077392578
7980/28840	Porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the	104.1791000366211
7981/28840	Athos and Aramis entered last and locked the door behind	117.91563415527344
7982/28840	Oblige me by taking a seat said DArtagnan pushing a chair toward Mordaunt who sat down pale but	165.45343017578125
7983/28840	Aramis Porthos and DArtagnan drew their chairs near	36.98847579956055
7984/28840	Athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the	135.7661590576172
7985/28840	Porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impat	74.98262023925781
7986/28840	Aramis bit his lips till the blood	232.6300811767578
7987/28840	DArtagnan alone was calm at least in	32.36293411254883
7988/28840	Monsieur Mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you	103.18122863769531
7989/28840	Though Mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of	150.5149383544922
7990/28840	His eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right	151.662109375
7991/28840	DArtagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said	35.22175979614258
7992/28840	Aramis muttered to himself We shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace	186.03919982910156
7993/28840	Porthos sucked his mustache muttering A good deal of ceremony tonight about crushing an add	333.2303771972656
7994/28840	Athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a basrel	162.2591552734375
7995/28840	The silence however could not last	1312.561279296875
7996/28840	Just now DArtagnan continued you were disguisedI mean to say attiredas a murderer and now   And now I look very much like a man who is going to be	44.84288787841797
7997/28840	Oh sir said DArtagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side   No sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and dag	52.957393646240234
7998/28840	I had the honor of asking you why you altered your	173.39073181152344
7999/28840	The mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe I do not think it would be out of keeping even at this	89.51029968261719
8000/28840	Why then have you laid it aside   Because remembering the scene at Armentieres I thought I should find four axes for one as I was to meet four execution	111.52472686767578
8001/28840	Sir replied DArtagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young I shall therefore overlook your frivolous	70.69033813476562
8002/28840	What took place at Armentieres has no connection whatever with the present	105.34733581542969
8003/28840	We could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight	161.2992706298828
8004/28840	Aha It is a duel then cried Mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the	102.71381378173828
8005/28840	Porthos rose always ready for this kind of	169.52288818359375
8006/28840	Do not let us do things in a	55.77986145019531
8007/28840	We will arrange the matter rather	1283.1337890625
8008/28840	Confess Monsieur Mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of	49.84395217895508
8009/28840	Then my dear sir I am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you	83.26255798339844
8010/28840	Of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof I can furnish is this   So saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to Mordaunt with true French	91.9138412475586
8011/28840	My sword is shorter than yours its true but bah I think the arm will make up for the	218.8003692626953
8012/28840	He might have been taken for a	45.36089324951172
8013/28840	Even his breathing seemed to be	195.1444091796875
8014/28840	Gentlemen said DArtagnan you shall have your	65.6299057006836
8015/28840	Monsieur Mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you	68.61900329589844
8016/28840	You can see it in his	92.81454467773438
8017/28840	So pray keep your places like Athos whose calmness is entirely laud	202.36952209472656
8018/28840	Besides we will have no words about	102.89037322998047
8019/28840	I have particular business to settle with this gentleman and I shall and will	147.23089599609375
8020/28840	Porthos and Aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword DArtagnan turned to his adversary   Sir I am waiting for	25.140735626220703
8021/28840	And for my part gentlemen I admire	85.3492431640625
8022/28840	You are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the	112.39737701416016
8023/28840	I hate you all but not	470.84820556640625
8024/28840	I hope to kill all four of you but I am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the	76.01750183105469
8025/28840	I claim then the right to choose my	339.0687255859375
8026/28840	If you refuse this right you may kill me but I shall not	69.66726684570312
8027/28840	It is but fair said Porthos and Aramis hoping he would choose one of	33.44865798950195
8028/28840	Athos and DArtagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply	132.31155395507812
8029/28840	Well then said Mordaunt I choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called Comte de la Fere calls himself Ath	52.929622650146484
8030/28840	Athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends Monsieur Mordaunt a duel between us is	61.06776809692383
8031/28840	Ah said Mordaunt with a sneer theres one who is	73.23039245605469
8032/28840	Zounds exclaimed DArtagnan bounding toward him who says that Athos is afraid   Let him have his say DArtagnan said Athos with a smile of sadness and	37.95112228393555
8033/28840	Is it your decision Athos resumed the Gas	77.07672882080078
8034/28840	You hear sir said DArtagnan turning to Mord	19.705839157104492
8035/28840	The Comte de la Fere will not do you the honor of fighting with	16.70203399658203
8036/28840	Choose one of us to replace the Comte de la F	14.19649887084961
8037/28840	As long as I dont fight with him it is the same to me with whom I	75.0856704711914
8038/28840	Put your names into a hat and draw	115.53866577148438
8039/28840	At least that will conciliate us all said Aram	74.78862762451172
8040/28840	I should never have thought of that said Porthos and yet it is very	23.94540023803711
8041/28840	Come Aramis said DArtagnan write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to Marie Michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the Duke of	61.23914337158203
8042/28840	Mordaunt sustained this new attack without win	635.6542358398438
8043/28840	He stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such	93.94270324707031
8044/28840	If he had not courage he had what is very like it namely	232.40078735351562
8045/28840	He then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to Mord	86.37879180908203
8046/28840	Mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading	139.9131622314453
8047/28840	Ah serpent muttered DArtagnan I would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my	76.0804214477539
8048/28840	Aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read DArtagn	104.82059478759766
8049/28840	The Gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to Mordaunt   I hope sir said he you have no objection to	19.155839920043945
8050/28840	None whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his	113.93473815917969
8051/28840	The moment that DArtagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquill	44.69960403442383
8052/28840	He turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that Mordaunt was looking about him in a singular	82.2802734375
8053/28840	Are you ready sir he said at	117.83132934570312
8054/28840	I was waiting for you sir said Mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to	41.03593826293945
8055/28840	Well then said the Gascon take care of yourself for I am not a bad hand at the rap	39.40768814086914
8056/28840	So much the better that sets my mind at	127.6161880493164
8057/28840	Give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the	87.19847869873047
8058/28840	Is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper   No but to set my mind at rest as you observed just	68.94898986816406
8059/28840	It is for something else than that I imagine muttered DArtagnan shaking his head doubt	42.55378723144531
8060/28840	On the honor of gentlemen said Aramis and Porth	23.444494247436523
8061/28840	In that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample	121.22882843017578
8062/28840	Yes gentlemen said DArtagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect I fancy he is anxious still to	88.85659790039062
8063/28840	This new attack made no impression on Mord	228.91006469726562
8064/28840	The space was cleared the two lamps placed on Cromwells desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords	95.89655303955078
8065/28840	DArtagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his	52.45799255371094
8066/28840	He made a rapid and brilliant feint which Mordaunt par	165.7592010498047
8067/28840	Aha he cried with a smile of	88.89147186279297
8068/28840	And without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced Mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding	151.88587951660156
8069/28840	This time it was Mordaunt who	78.27696228027344
8070/28840	Ah sir said DArtagnan you have a wicked	21.947118759155273
8071/28840	Ah you lose ground you are turning Well as you please I even gain something by it for I no longer see that wicked smile of	156.39208984375
8072/28840	You have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are	92.09977722167969
8073/28840	Look at my eyes and you will see what no lookingglass has ever shown youa frank and honorable count	178.2266082763672
8074/28840	To this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of DArtagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponents attention Mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with DArtagn	103.25865936279297
8075/28840	He smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the Gascon	94.97454071044922
8076/28840	Come come cried DArtagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed Mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a	88.28450775146484
8077/28840	However as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever Mordaunts foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left	101.65093994140625
8078/28840	Ah this time you cannot lose ground my fine friend exclaimed DArtagn	56.967960357666016
8079/28840	Gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall	444.9341125488281
8080/28840	Well then you shall see it	104.3500747680664
8081/28840	In a second DArtagnan had made three terrible thrusts at Mordaunt all of which touched but only pricked	105.0112075805664
8082/28840	The three friends looked on panting and	333.9525451660156
8083/28840	DArtagnan sprang back the wall had closed	47.60615539550781
8084/28840	Mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which Cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and	157.0651397705078
8085/28840	The Gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron	74.11170196533203
8086/28840	Help me gentlemen cried DArtagnan we must break in this	41.006492614746094
8087/28840	It is the devil in person said Aramis hastening	98.37423706054688
8088/28840	He escapes us growled Porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in	200.60946655273438
8089/28840	I thought as much said DArtagnan wasting his strength in useless	70.32112121582031
8090/28840	Zounds I thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the	167.3666229248047
8091/28840	I thought he was up to	124.91539764404297
8092/28840	Its a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said Aram	70.15697479248047
8093/28840	Its a piece of good fortune sent from Heaven said Athos evidently much	122.2503890991211
8094/28840	Really said DArtagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts Athos I cannot imagine how you can talk to us in that	68.41822814941406
8095/28840	You cannot understand the position we are	109.55805206298828

8097/28840	This fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred ironsided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this	227.56944274902344
8098/28840	If we stay here five minutes more theres an end of	156.30613708496094
8099/28840	But where shall we go asked Porth	41.64990234375
8100/28840	To the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there if it please God to France where at least I understand the architecture of the	132.64732360839844
8101/28840	So suiting the action to the word DArtagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the	48.06113815307617
8102/28840	DArtagnan had judged correctly Mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost	35.65761184692383
8103/28840	He knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to	106.57511138916016
8104/28840	This time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of	58.387901306152344
8105/28840	After closing the door carefully behind him Mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take	107.83045196533203
8106/28840	Good he said nothing almost nothingscratches nothing more two in the arm and one in the	284.5118713378906
8107/28840	The wounds that I make are better than thatwitness the executioner of Bethune my uncle and King	78.50115966796875
8108/28840	Now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save	146.11807250976562
8109/28840	They must diedie all togetherkilled at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of	319.5340270996094
8110/28840	I will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but I will arrive before they	130.69154357910156
8111/28840	Mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league	156.2080078125
8112/28840	He made that quarter of a league in four or five	36.90357208251953
8113/28840	Arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high	158.7491912841797
8114/28840	A quarter of an hour later he was at	40.35790252685547
8115/28840	That dark point yonder is the Isle of	250.0435333251953
8116/28840	Good I am half an hour in advance of them an hour	61.25602722167969
8117/28840	Fool that I was I have almost killed myself by my needless	497.4914855957031
8118/28840	Now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which I wonder is the Lightning   At this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward	61.40134048461914
8119/28840	Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe signal agreed uponwaved it in the air and the man came up to	113.50260925292969
8120/28840	He was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his	127.20256805419922
8121/28840	Do you wish to go on the water sir said the	42.13454055786133
8122/28840	And perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than	137.88587951660156
8123/28840	You would like one that sails as rapidly as   Lightning interrupted Mord	144.76467895507812
8124/28840	Then mine is the boat you want	215.3253173828125
8125/28840	I begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain	70.61412811279297
8126/28840	Here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each	40.97673797607422
8127/28840	Good quite right cried Mordaunt springing off his	68.5641860961914
8128/28840	Theres not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your	133.84849548339844
8129/28840	But asked the sailor where are your companions I thought there were four of	104.36604309082031
8130/28840	Im not the man you take me for you are in Captain Rogerss post are you not under orders from General Crom	73.35121154785156
8131/28840	Mine also are from him   Indeed sir I recognize you you are Captain Mord	94.57923126220703
8132/28840	Oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his	143.3354949951172
8133/28840	The general remembered that I had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this	86.87264251708984
8134/28840	Is there anything new in the wind  	202.8292694091797
8135/28840	I thought perhaps that the kings death   Has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be	82.90303802490234
8136/28840	What have you come for then   To embark with	53.692420959472656
8137/28840	Ah ah the general doubted my fidelity   No but I wish to have a share in my	86.60396575927734
8138/28840	Havent you some one who will relieve me of my horse   Groslow whistled and a sailor	91.1373519897461
8139/28840	Patrick said Groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest	35.471527099609375
8140/28840	If any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an Irish	150.5357666015625
8141/28840	Now said Mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you   There is no danger dressed as I am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as	53.25263595581055
8142/28840	Besides even you didnt recognize me they will be much less likely	124.84918212890625
8143/28840	That is true said Mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of	51.0674934387207
8144/28840	Everything is ready is it not  	31.04174041748047
8145/28840	The cargo on board  	60.84355926513672
8146/28840	Five full casks   And fifty empty	242.00973510742188
8147/28840	We are carrying port wine to An	1073.58447265625
8148/28840	Now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be	91.57157135009766
8149/28840	It is important that none of your crew should see	107.98275756835938
8150/28840	I have but one man on board and I am as sure of him as I am of	45.18986129760742
8151/28840	Besides he doesnt know you like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our	189.93423461914062
8152/28840	They then went down to the	58.64414978027344
8153/28840	A boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a	120.2198257446289
8154/28840	Groslow jumped in followed by Mordaunt and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of London and Mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the Isle of	124.43071746826172
8155/28840	When they reached the side of this felucca Mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among lands	90.55609130859375
8156/28840	He went with Groslow to the captains berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks for the chief apartment had been given up by Captain Rogers to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the	60.04098892211914
8157/28840	They will have nothing to do then at this end said Mord	41.70891189575195
8158/28840	Return to Greenwich and bring them	138.23861694335938
8159/28840	I shall hide myself in your	186.55532836914062
8160/28840	You have a longboat   That in which we	51.60338592529297
8161/28840	Fasten it to the poop with a rope put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the	86.668212890625
8162/28840	Put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves	83.35452270507812
8163/28840	Do you wish to see the powderroom  	44.3485221862793
8164/28840	When you return I will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you cannot be recognized by	144.90203857421875
8165/28840	Groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached	127.58070373535156
8166/28840	The wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved	108.32111358642578
8167/28840	These horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of DArtagnan and Ath	59.04140090942383
8168/28840	As soon as they arrived at the spot where Groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they	46.56996154785156
8169/28840	Athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst DArtagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watch	79.38758850097656
8170/28840	On seeing the appointed signal Groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the	127.27877044677734
8171/28840	What do you want with us he asked of Gros	41.628440856933594
8172/28840	I wish to inform you my lord replied Groslow with an Irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for Captain Rogers you will not find	36.229339599609375
8173/28840	He fell down this morning and broke his	92.28453826904297
8174/28840	Was that all he said inquired Ath	70.50636291503906
8175/28840	No my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if I landed you safe and sound at Boulogne or any other port you choose in	81.37835693359375
8176/28840	What do you think of all this said Athos in a low tone to DArtagnan after explaining to him in French what the sailor had said in	35.36861038208008
8177/28840	It seems a likely story to	308.67010498046875
8178/28840	Besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the Gascon and you Athos you know something of everything and can be our	90.11634063720703
8179/28840	I dare say you know how to navigate should he fail	273.7297058105469
8180/28840	My father meant me for the navy and I have some vague notions about	150.99334716796875
8181/28840	Thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and	100.60008239746094
8182/28840	Parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them to France but he had straightway	407.65716552734375
8183/28840	It is very simple Mousqueton had said he is thinking of Gros	34.766998291015625
8184/28840	It was Captain Groslow the reader will remember who had broken Parrys	142.91693115234375
8185/28840	DArtagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with	98.99283599853516
8186/28840	He found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too	428.9831237792969
8187/28840	He had reported to Aramis what had taken place and Aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his	82.03500366210938
8188/28840	A slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed Athos of the Gascons uneas	99.72705078125
8189/28840	We have no time now for suspicions said Ath	60.19211196899414
8190/28840	The boat is waiting for us	148.04739379882812
8191/28840	Besides said Aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time We can watch the sk	122.6978530883789
8192/28840	And if he doesnt go straight I will crush him thats	183.2328643798828
8193/28840	You first Mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the	70.65845489501953
8194/28840	Athos followed them then Porthos then Aram	75.69886016845703
8195/28840	DArtagnan went last still shaking his	46.783721923828125
8196/28840	What in the devil is the matter with you my friend said Porth	18.358047485351562
8197/28840	Upon my word you would make Caesar	180.89718627929688
8198/28840	The matter is replied DArtagnan that I can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor excis	137.16648864746094
8199/28840	And you complain of that said Porth	39.45579528808594
8200/28840	Everything goes as if in flowery	467.8854064941406
8201/28840	But no matter we must trust in	157.8282928466797
8202/28840	As soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors who boathook in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were	78.53672790527344
8203/28840	The other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to	179.27159118652344
8204/28840	As soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more	126.01164245605469
8205/28840	At last we are off exclaimed Porth	132.3683624267578
8206/28840	Yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a	96.12165832519531
8207/28840	We are not yet at our destination observed the prudent DArtagnan beware of misad	54.364524841308594
8208/28840	Ah my friend cried Porthos like the crows you always bring bad om	91.77513885498047
8209/28840	Who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one   Yes but tomorrow morning   Tomorrow we shall be at Boulog	61.313011169433594
8210/28840	I hope so with all my heart said the Gascon and I confess my	43.61483383178711
8211/28840	Yes Athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it I was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush	69.97639465332031
8212/28840	But said Porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the	41.00587463378906
8213/28840	You dont imagine he would consider a little thing like that   At any rate said Porthos I am glad to hear DArtagnan admit that he is	29.14962387084961
8214/28840	I not only confess it but am proud of it returned the Gascon Im not such a rhinoceros as you	119.20062255859375
8215/28840	Oho whats that   The Lightning answered the captain our felu	93.00798034667969
8216/28840	They went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for thema cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some	103.84654998779297
8217/28840	Stop a moment cried DArtagnan pray how many men have you on board captain   I dont understand was the	40.120182037353516
8218/28840	Groslow on the question being interpreted answered Three without counting	431.0029602050781
8219/28840	DArtagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three	129.08404541015625
8220/28840	Oh he exclaimed I begin to be more at my ease however whilst you settle yourselves I shall make the round of the	136.83810424804688
8221/28840	As for me said Porthos I will see to the	27.07765007019043
8222/28840	A very good idea Porthos said the Gas	27.598770141601562
8223/28840	Athos lend me Grimaud who in the society of his friend Parry has perhaps picked up a little English and can act as my	122.69135284423828
8224/28840	DArtagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in English Come being with the classic English oath the only English words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower	91.96803283691406
8225/28840	Oho cried DArtagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels one would think one was in the cave of Ali Bab	54.84676742553711
8226/28840	What is there in them he added putting his lantern on one of the cas	86.0249252319336
8227/28840	The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered   Port	222.04684448242188
8228/28840	Ah port wine tis a comfort said the Gascon since we shall not die of	79.85623931884766
8229/28840	Are they all full   Grimaud translated the question and Groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered   Some full others	76.46695709228516
8230/28840	Stop said the Englishman I have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where Mousqueton and Blaisois were preparing	29.111099243164062
8231/28840	Here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third	108.72376251220703
8232/28840	This was the room appropriated to the	103.66458129882812
8233/28840	Two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire	211.4408416748047
8234/28840	DArtagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the	74.49644470214844
8235/28840	And this room he asked pointing to the captains	124.00987243652344
8236/28840	DArtagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed   Good he	50.19329071044922
8237/28840	If there is an army on board it is not here that it is	61.63839340209961
8238/28840	Let us see what Porthos has found for	87.93536376953125
8239/28840	And thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends	231.4095458984375
8240/28840	Porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over	250.1663818359375
8241/28840	He had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when DArtagnan	39.75186538696289
8242/28840	Athos and Aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in	163.0120849609375

8245/28840	Blaisois and Mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a val	114.40592193603516
8246/28840	On a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three	113.29540252685547
8247/28840	I know it will serve me as it did when we came	59.3979377746582
8248/28840	And to think said Mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop	115.69032287597656
8249/28840	Pah   But where is your wicker flask Monsieur Mousqueton Have you lost it asked Blais	35.2862548828125

8256/28840	Yes but beer asked Blaisois sharply is that their true drink   As to that answered Mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty I must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the	101.54074096679688
8257/28840	What Monsieur Mousqueton The Englishdo they dislike wine   They hate	81.68762969970703
8258/28840	But I have seen them drink	92.37584686279297
8259/28840	For example an English prince died one day because they had put him into a butt of Malm	162.27276611328125
8260/28840	I heard the Chevalier dHerblay say	13.454668998718262
8261/28840	The fool cried Blaisois I wish I had been in his	71.80026245117188
8262/28840	Thou canst be said Grimaud writing down his	758.8777465820312
8263/28840	How asked Blaisois I can Explain	59.81392288208008
8264/28840	Grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the	197.92941284179688
8265/28840	Port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by DArtagnan and	23.284896850585938
8266/28840	Eh eh ah Those barrels I saw through the door   Port replied Grimaud beginning a fresh	234.8511505126953
8267/28840	I have heard said Blaisois that port is a very good	45.637142181396484
8268/28840	Excellent there is port wine in the cellar of Monsieur le Baron de Bracie	28.38496208190918
8269/28840	Suppose we ask these Englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest Blais	229.2997283935547
8270/28840	Sell cried Mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character	203.62973022460938
8271/28840	One may well perceive young man that you are	140.2920684814453
8272/28840	Why buy what one can take   Take said Blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor That is forbidden it seems to	82.40950012207031
8273/28840	In the commandments of God or of the church I dont know	126.293701171875
8274/28840	I only know it says Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors goods nor yet his	751.8925170898438
8275/28840	That is a childs reason Monsieur Blaisois said Mousqueton in his most patronizing	40.03139877319336
8276/28840	Yes you talk like a childI repeat the	165.46937561035156
8277/28840	Where have you read in the Scriptures I ask you that the English are your neighbors   Where that is true said Blaisois at least I cant now recall	66.41078186035156
8278/28840	A childs reasonI repeat it continued Mousqu	99.13411712646484
8279/28840	If you had been ten years engaged in war as Grimaud and I have been my dear Blaisois you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of	67.08473205566406
8280/28840	Now an Englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the English therefore it belongs to	111.63390350341797
8281/28840	And our masters asked Blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion   Mousqueton smiled disdain	51.6939811706543
8282/28840	I suppose that you think it necessary that I should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say Gentlemen your servant Mousqueton is	84.10655975341797
8283/28840	What does Monsieur Bracieux care think you whether I am thirsty or not   Tis a very expensive wine said Blaisois shaking his	39.91792678833008
8284/28840	Were it liquid gold Monsieur Blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this	164.31427001953125
8285/28840	Know that Monsieur de Bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every	50.17662048339844
8286/28840	His manner became more and more lofty every instant then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine	107.92772674560547
8287/28840	Ah locked he exclaimed these devils of English how suspicious they are   Locked said Blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more	118.08737182617188
8288/28840	Perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in	102.9386215209961
8289/28840	I cannot throw the loop through this partition nor move with a packthread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred	122.12943267822266
8290/28840	No but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered Blaisois and make a hole in the cask with a gim	47.4484748840332
8291/28840	Mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in Blaisois qualities for which he did not give him	109.9430160522461
8292/28840	Tis true he said but where can I get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to pierce the cask   Trousers said Grimaud still squaring his	83.23949432373047
8293/28840	Grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate	129.96493530273438
8294/28840	Mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his	207.39126586914062
8295/28840	In a few minutes he had extracted three	67.27023315429688
8296/28840	He tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in the fable who thought he was larger than he really was he found he must take out three or four more before he could get	97.74249267578125
8297/28840	He sighed and set to work	276.4200134277344
8298/28840	That is true said Mousqueton glancing at his friends long and thin body you will pass	77.614013671875
8299/28840	And he knows the full casks said Blaisois for he has already been in the hold with Monsieur le Chevalier dArtagn	22.415103912353516
8300/28840	Let Monsieur Grimaud go in Monsieur M	20.774383544921875
8301/28840	I could go in as well as Grimaud said Mousqueton a little piqu	35.88909912109375
8302/28840	Yes but that would take too much time and I am	63.982975006103516
8303/28840	I am getting more and more seas	102.7869644165039
8304/28840	Go in then Grimaud said Mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gim	115.64895629882812
8305/28840	Then with a friendly gesture toward Mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and	93.0348129272461
8306/28840	Blaisois was in a state of great excitement he was in ecstas	49.949745178222656
8307/28840	Of all the exploits performed since their arrival in England by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most	157.0608673095703
8308/28840	You are about to see said Mousqueton looking at Blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see Blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are	37.479740142822266
8309/28840	My cloak said Grimaud from the bottom of the	101.39543914794922
8310/28840	My cloakstop up the aperture with	345.0760498046875
8311/28840	Simpleton exclaimed Mousqueton suppose any one came into the	101.34782409667969
8312/28840	Ah true cried Blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the	64.19962310791016
8313/28840	Grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered Mousqu	252.8469696044922
8314/28840	As for me when I have no candle I cant take two steps without knocking against	142.12582397460938
8315/28840	Thats because you havent served said Mousqu	91.45309448242188
8316/28840	Had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed	64.8044204711914
8317/28840	But hark I think some one is	191.91873168945312
8318/28840	Mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to Blaisois to follow his	55.8710823059082
8319/28840	The door of their cabin was	208.00350952148438
8320/28840	Two men wrapped in their cloaks	164.02659606933594
8321/28840	Oho said they not in bed at a quarter past	180.46417236328125
8322/28840	In a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and sn	65.67404174804688
8323/28840	These two men then went toward the compartment in which Grimaud was secreted opened the door entered and shut it after	91.94119262695312
8324/28840	Ah cried Blaisois he is lost   Grimauds a cunning fellow murmured Mousqu	28.4483642578125
8325/28840	They said a quarter of an	18.27543067932129
8326/28840	We still have five minutes replied Mousqu	52.6808967590332
8327/28840	We should have heard the blow	143.02061462402344
8328/28840	But if he doesnt return   Here he	43.29547882080078
8329/28840	At that very moment Grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around	104.2931137084961
8330/28840	Both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankardit was full of gun	85.71815490722656
8331/28840	Convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine Grimaud hastened to awake DArtagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken	73.56951141357422
8332/28840	Imposing silence Grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenants ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it p	191.70103454589844
8333/28840	This was the gist of his strange story   The first barrel that Grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struckit was	91.63280487060547
8334/28840	He passed on to anotherit also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently	221.78799438476562
8335/28840	He was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing	118.42520141601562
8336/28840	His face was hidden under the wide brim of his	86.17449188232422
8337/28840	Grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great	86.04457092285156
8338/28840	Have you the wick asked the one who carried the	125.43641662597656
8339/28840	At the voice of this last speaker Grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very	92.1358413696289
8340/28840	He rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of Mord	83.31188201904297
8341/28840	How long will this fuse burn asked this	796.7744140625
8342/28840	That voice also was known to Grim	217.6070556640625
8343/28840	He looked from one to the other and after Mordaunt he recognized Gros	61.19442367553711
8344/28840	Then tell the men to be in readinessdont tell them why	364.4015197753906
8345/28840	When the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your	1158.861572265625
8346/28840	That is when I have lighted the match   I will undertake	62.88405227661133
8347/28840	I wish to be sure of my	35.17000961303711
8348/28840	Are the oars in the boat   Everything is	58.97699737548828
8349/28840	Mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the	69.15603637695312
8350/28840	You hear meat a quarter past midnightin fact in twenty	507.05938720703125
8351/28840	Grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood	140.04751586914062
8352/28840	But what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the	217.76234436035156
8353/28840	He had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen Mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which Mordaunt had given in	50.45050048828125
8354/28840	Then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by Blaisois and Mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse	75.51918029785156
8355/28840	At the door he stopped to	75.37789916992188
8356/28840	Do you hear how they sleep he	249.895263671875
8357/28840	In fact Porthos could be heard snoring through the	128.6107635498047
8358/28840	Tis God who gives them into our hands answered Gros	120.74324798583984
8359/28840	This time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined Mord	152.084228515625
8360/28840	Grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent	132.83822631835938
8361/28840	DArtagnan pressing his hand repeated his	51.958641052246094
8362/28840	Athos is near you said DArtagnan warn him as I have warned	58.592079162597656
8363/28840	Aramis easily aroused Athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized	205.3859100341797
8364/28840	But there was more difficulty in arousing Porth	53.162086486816406
8365/28840	He was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when DArtagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his	75.14118957519531
8366/28840	Then our Gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one	108.76155853271484
8367/28840	Friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead	78.4997787475586
8368/28840	Bah said Athos are you still afraid   Do you know who is captain of this vessel  	30.278209686279297
8369/28840	The shudder of the three musketeers showed to DArtagnan that his words began to make some impression on	44.58781051635742
8370/28840	Groslow said Aramis the devil   Who is this Groslow asked Porth	23.443952560424805
8371/28840	Groslow is the man who broke Parrys head and is now getting ready to break	176.31912231445312
8372/28840	Oh oh   And do you know who is his lieutenant   His lieutenant There is none said Ath	56.53201675415039
8373/28840	They dont have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of	57.92272186279297
8374/28840	Yes but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is Monsieur Mord	38.137630462646484
8375/28840	This time the musketeers did more than shudderthey almost cried	99.94818878173828
8376/28840	Those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with	271.52325439453125
8377/28840	We must seize the felucca said Aram	44.24879455566406
8378/28840	Those casks which I took for casks of port wine are filled with	183.0122833251953
8379/28840	When Mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and on my word he would be bad company in going either to Heaven or to	192.41354370117188
8380/28840	You have some plan then asked Ath	52.1677360534668
8381/28840	What is it   Have you confidence in me   Give your orders said the three musket	30.3232364654541
8382/28840	DArtagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man	79.87268829345703
8383/28840	He turned it gently on its	195.8446807861328
8384/28840	The deuce it is a very cold one my dear friend said Aram	42.013282775878906
8385/28840	Stay here if you like but I warn you twill be rather too warm	177.6218719482422
8386/28840	But we cannot swim to the	99.79922485351562
8387/28840	The longboat is yonder lashed to the felu	57.672889709472656
8388/28840	We will take possession of it and cut the	106.63046264648438
8389/28840	A moments delay said Athos our servants   Here we are they	84.29896545410156
8390/28840	Meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which DArtagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the	76.9134292602539
8391/28840	Those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry	172.2880096435547
8392/28840	Gracious Heaven we are hesitating cried DArtagnan if we hesitate what will the servants do   I do not hesitate you know said Grim	51.74879455566406
8393/28840	Sir interposed Blaisois I warn you that I can only swim in	35.01079559326172
8394/28840	And I not at all said Mousqu	35.01572799682617
8395/28840	But DArtagnan had now slipped through the	39.08243179321289
8396/28840	Yes the Gascon answered Athos you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over	174.23179626464844
8397/28840	Porthos kill every one who stands in your	147.37376403808594
8398/28840	And after pressing the hand of Athos DArtagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his	56.14054489135742
8399/28840	Athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the	106.96907043457031
8400/28840	DArtagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of	80.57772064208984
8401/28840	Then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of Aramis and Grim	84.75776672363281
8402/28840	I am uneasy about Blaisois said Athos he can he says only swim in	75.89580535888672
8403/28840	When people can swim at all they can swim	270.12261962890625
8404/28840	To the boat to the boat   But Porthos I do not see	21.87846565246582
8405/28840	But monsieur said Mousqueton I cant swim let me stay	27.395998001098633
8406/28840	I assure you I shall be very much in the way in that little boat said Mousqu	34.111595153808594
8407/28840	And I know I shall drown before reaching it continued Blais	87.76809692382812
8408/28840	Come along I shall strangle you both if you dont get out said Porthos at last seizing Mousqueton by the	63.71495819091797
8409/28840	A sublime action at all events for Mousqueton looked upon himself as	85.8362808227539
8410/28840	Ah have you your sword Athos cried DArtagn	19.08185386657715
8411/28840	Athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the	115.3969955444336
8412/28840	The felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing	122.40705871582031
8413/28840	Come Athos said DArtagnan giving his hand to the count you are going to see something curious added the Gas	23.2808780670166
8414/28840	Scarcely had DArtagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the	57.76624298095703
8415/28840	That you may be sure said the Gascon means	78.24408721923828
8416/28840	They then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind	162.9241943359375
8417/28840	Shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walk	230.72390747070312
8418/28840	In the midst of these screams they saw Mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in	69.18859100341797
8419/28840	The agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of Groslow who at the hour fixed by Mordaunt had collected his men and the	147.7296142578125
8420/28840	Mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep sl	78.45442199707031
8421/28840	Then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom God blinds he had set fire to the wick of nit	89.87984466552734
8422/28840	All this while Groslow and his men were assembled on	103.35151672363281
8423/28840	Haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said Gros	89.01461029052734
8424/28840	One of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it came without the least	105.96884155273438
8425/28840	The cable is cut he cried no boat   How no boat exclaimed Groslow it is	143.07608032226562
8426/28840	Tis true however answered the sailor theres nothing in the wake of the ship besides heres the end of the	101.04074096679688
8427/28840	Whats the matter cried Mordaunt who coming up out of the hatchway rushed to the stern waving his	131.8851318359375
8428/28840	Only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the	150.9766387939453
8429/28840	Mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the	247.8887481689453
8430/28840	Empty he exclaimed the infernal demons   We must pursue them said Groslow they cant be gone far and we will sink them passing over	69.29566955566406
8431/28840	Yes but the fire ejaculated Mordaunt I have lighted	41.02547073364258
8432/28840	Ten thousand devils cried Groslow rushing to the hatchway perhaps there is still time to save	65.08769226074219
8433/28840	Mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after	211.61160278320312
8434/28840	The instant Groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a	108.74606323242188
8435/28840	Onlythe felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and Groslow and his three sailors were	45.73701477050781
8436/28840	The four friends saw all thisnot a single detail of this fearful scene escaped	192.77877807617188

8438/28840	By Heaven at last said Athos the first to speak by this time I think all must be	54.33559036254883
8439/28840	Here my lords save me help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the	106.34225463867188
8440/28840	Tis he it is his voice   All still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the	63.86945724487305
8441/28840	After a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming	88.62310791015625
8442/28840	Athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his	205.15823364257812
8443/28840	Yes yes I see him well enough said DArtagn	20.619426727294922
8444/28840	Heagain cried Porthos who was breathing like a blacksmiths bellows why he is made of	141.86264038085938
8445/28840	Aramis and DArtagnan whispered to each	40.653804779052734
8446/28840	Mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves Pity pity on me gentlemen in Heavens name my strength is failing me I am	202.81187438964844
8447/28840	The voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of Ath	145.10256958007812
8448/28840	Indeed said DArtagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your	46.54793930053711
8449/28840	Does he think we are going to take him in Row Porthos	39.99905776977539
8450/28840	And setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms	280.0408020019531
8451/28840	Oh you will not abandon me You will not leave me to perish You will not be pitiless cried Mord	41.38959884643555
8452/28840	Ah ah said Porthos to Mordaunt I think we have you now my hero and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of	61.17213821411133
8453/28840	Oh Porthos murmured the Comte de la F	6.041974067687988
8454/28840	Oh pray for mercys sake dont fly from	317.8304443359375
8455/28840	For pitys sake cried the young man whose agonydrawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters	158.60543823242188
8456/28840	DArtagnan however who had consulted with Aramis spoke to the poor w	27.44340705871582
8457/28840	Go away he said your repentance is too recent to inspire	434.32763671875
8458/28840	See the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed Monsieur Groslow and his	55.68408203125
8459/28840	Sir replied Mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is	116.70243072509766
8460/28840	Gentlemen I am young scarcely twentythree years	487.2744445800781
8461/28840	I was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my	72.5544662475586
8462/28840	You would have done what I	39.67095184326172
8463/28840	Mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural	131.00001525878906
8464/28840	Alas he said I am then to die You are going to kill the son as you killed the mother Surely if I am culpable and if I ask for pardon I ought to be	76.20285034179688
8465/28840	Then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his	66.09284973144531
8466/28840	Oh this is torture to me cried Ath	48.85939025878906
8467/28840	DArtagnan DArtagnan cried Athos my son I entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save	36.414512634277344
8468/28840	I cannot resist doing so he must	112.1522445678711

8470/28840	If he lays his hand on the boats edge I will cut it off regicide that he	91.52843475341797
8471/28840	What are you going to do asked Aram	11.597606658935547
8472/28840	Throw myself in the water and strangle	45.626468658447266
8473/28840	Oh gentlemen cried Athos be men be Christians See death is depicted on his face Ah do not bring on me the horrors of remorse Grant me this poor wretchs	170.74374389648438
8474/28840	I will bless youI   I am dying cried Mordaunt come to me come to me   DArtagnan began to be	25.17798614501953
8475/28840	The boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer Ath	120.61682891845703
8476/28840	Mordaunt made a last effortroseseized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of	179.0833740234375
8477/28840	Thats right said Athos put your other hand	223.37876892089844
8478/28840	And he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of Mordaunt and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been	126.16447448730469
8479/28840	Now sir said the count you are safecalm	44.56986999511719
8480/28840	Mute with horror the three friends had remained openmouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was	137.31224060058594
8481/28840	Porthos was the first who came to	39.03278732299805
8482/28840	In the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbe	60.97602462768555
8483/28840	Mordaunt Mordaunt cried the three friends tis Mordaunt   But Athos exclaimed DArtagn	60.21574020385742
8484/28840	Suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and Grimaud uttered a shout of joy every one turned around and beheld Athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the	77.7164077758789
8485/28840	Eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly Athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with	129.36668395996094
8486/28840	No replied Athos and he   Oh he now we may say at last thank Heaven he is really	76.68122100830078
8487/28840	Look and DArtagnan obliging Athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of Mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal	112.12507629394531
8488/28840	Athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were	126.24776458740234
8489/28840	Bravo Athos cried Aramis with an emotion very rare in	140.17364501953125
8490/28840	A capital blow you gave cried Porth	194.01773071289062
8491/28840	In short said DArtagnan this has been the will of	36.378265380859375
8492/28840	It was not I who killed him said Athos in a soft low tone twas	97.76136779785156
8493/28840	How Mousqueton had a Narrow Escape of being	88.38606262207031
8494/28840	A deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene	130.12362670898438
8495/28840	I have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what I have just	80.62683868408203
8496/28840	Nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation I protest that I feel	140.26405334472656
8497/28840	I have a hundred pounds weight less upon my	140.6357421875
8498/28840	In fact Porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful	109.1307601928711
8499/28840	For my part observed Aramis I cannot say the same as you do Porth	47.98933792114258
8500/28840	I am still terrified to such a degree that I scarcely believe my	79.99855041503906
8501/28840	I look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his	91.28326416015625
8502/28840	The poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his	61.590328216552734
8503/28840	I do not reproach you Athos for what you have	27.881465911865234
8504/28840	On the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to	172.6822967529297
8505/28840	So now I breathe againI am happy   Dont be in haste to celebrate a victory Porthos interposed DArtagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now	64.65857696533203
8506/28840	Men may subdue menthey cannot overcome the	250.91639709472656
8507/28840	We are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark should a blast of wind upset the boat we are	162.37850952148438
8508/28840	You are ungrateful DArtagnan said Athos yes ungrateful to Providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous	37.5073356628418
8509/28840	Let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to Calais or Boulog	100.91377258300781
8510/28840	Should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by	352.61505126953125
8511/28840	Now we are on the very road which all the vessels between Dover and Calais take tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us	101.81758117675781
8512/28840	But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north   That said Athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the	75.80000305175781
8513/28840	Which implies that we may die of hunger said Aram	52.45795440673828
8514/28840	Tis more than possible answered the Comte de la F	13.182730674743652
8515/28840	Mousqueton sighed again more deeply than	159.25088500976562
8516/28840	What is the matter what ails you asked Porth	20.01848793029785
8517/28840	Impossible your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold	216.2110595703125
8518/28840	Ah sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me sh	155.40554809570312
8519/28840	How is that Mousqueton   Alas your honor in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a lot of books of	33.75492858886719
8520/28840	What then   Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry	116.56350708007812
8521/28840	Yes sir answered Mousqueton but permit me to say I see nothing laughable in	35.47058868408203
8522/28840	However he added turning to Porthos I should not regret dying sir were I sure that by doing so I might still be useful to	68.54143524169922
8523/28840	Mouston replied Porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of Pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the	123.65269470214844
8524/28840	And you should call it Devotion added Aramis the vineyard of selfsacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your	86.43058013916016
8525/28840	Chevalier said DArtagnan laughing you could eat a piece of Mouston couldnt you especially after two or three days of fasting   Oh no replied Aramis I should much prefer Blaisois we havent known him so	51.542999267578125
8526/28840	One may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert Athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of Grimaud were not	73.0557632446289
8527/28840	Suddenly Mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted	84.961669921875
8528/28840	Oh sir he cried passing the bottle to Porthos we are savedthe bark is supplied with	128.3475799560547
8529/28840	This intelligence restored every one save Athos to gay	324.1443786621094
8530/28840	Zounds exclaimed Porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the	340.1401062011719
8531/28840	And he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and	122.72037506103516
8532/28840	Now said Athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and I will	62.91503143310547
8533/28840	After some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by Ath	138.3218231201172
8534/28840	It was in fact a small craft from Dunkirk bound for Boulog	45.3526725769043
8535/28840	A quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all	154.2786865234375
8536/28840	Grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine oclock in the morning having a fair wind our Frenchmen set foot on their native	103.49180603027344
8537/28840	Egad how strong one feels here said Porthos almost burying his large feet in the	143.59121704101562
8538/28840	Zounds I could defy a nation   Be quiet Porthos said DArtagnan we are	35.78399658203125
8539/28840	These people who are looking at us are only merchants said Athos and are looking more at the cargo than at	84.47444152832031
8540/28840	I shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and I shall make for the Dunes as soon as	48.42088317871094
8541/28840	Sandy hills about Dunkirk from which it derives its	619.0416259765625
8542/28840	The party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unob	164.37469482421875
8543/28840	Here after a short conference they proposed to	157.87933349609375
8544/28840	Because answered the Gascon we were sent Porthos and I by Cardinal Mazarin to fight for Cromwell instead of fighting for Cromwell we have served Charles	65.32866668701172
8545/28840	not the same thing by any	34.223724365234375
8546/28840	In returning with the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur dHerblay our crime would be	17.928058624267578
8547/28840	We have circumvented Cromwell Mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing Maz	92.7115249633789
8548/28840	You forget replied Athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered	178.64463806152344
8549/28840	Truly Athos interrupted DArtagnan I am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed	64.92002868652344
8550/28840	Come Athos and Aramis go to the right Porthos come with me to the left these gentlemen should file off into Normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach	90.07462310791016
8551/28840	He then gave his friends minute directions as to their	290.3078308105469
8552/28840	Ah my dear friend exclaimed Athos how I should admire the resources of your mind did I not stop to adore those of your	63.878623962402344
8553/28840	Isnt this fox a genius Athos asked the Gas	167.40231323242188

8559/28840	Let us be open with each other and	130.40756225585938
8560/28840	What cried the Gascon do you think Athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and Aramis   No answered Athos embrace me my	49.0178108215332
8561/28840	Zounds said Porthos sobbing I believe Im crying but how foolish all this is   Then they	99.82572937011719
8562/28840	At that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the Dunes	144.31607055664062
8563/28840	At last they lost sight of each	78.45730590820312
8564/28840	Sacrebleu DArtagnan said Porthos I must out with it at once for I cant keep to myself anything I have against you I havent been able to recognize you in this	73.05726623535156
8565/28840	Why not said DArtagnan with his wise	28.998571395874023
8566/28840	Because if as you say Athos and Aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon	51.97633743286133

8570/28840	Oh oh said Porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me DArtagn	44.13433837890625
8571/28840	Bah perhaps not so great as you think Porthos you know the proverb All roads lead to	92.7235107421875
8572/28840	But how is it that we are incurring greater risks than Athos and Aramis asked Porth	38.01612854003906
8573/28840	we very nearly succeeded in saving	221.76092529296875
8574/28840	We shall not be safe till we have seen Mazarin and then   The devil said Porthos what can we say to Mazarin   Leave that to meI have my	40.45536804199219
8575/28840	Cromwell is mighty Mazarin is tricky but I would rather have to do with them than with the late Monsieur Mord	54.740665435791016
8576/28840	Ah said Porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late Monsieur Mord	17.633434295654297
8577/28840	The two immediately started across country toward the road to Paris followed by Mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too	58.6909294128418
8578/28840	The first feeling that pervaded Paris on hearing of the flight to Saint Germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves	101.24146270751953
8579/28840	This threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was	178.63108825683594
8580/28840	Mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commencedby the queen to attack Paris by the citizens to defend	296.3209228515625
8581/28840	The latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the Prince de Conti the brother of the Prince de Condé and the Duc de Longueville his brotherin	34.98601531982422
8582/28840	This unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in Paris on the tenth of January and the Prince of Conti was named but not until after a stormy discussion generalissimo of the army of the king out of	123.36077117919922
8583/28840	As for the Duc de Beaufort he arrived from Vendome according to the annals of the day bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the market	81.31629943847656
8584/28840	The Parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as	257.8914794921875
8585/28840	On the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious	344.86468505859375
8586/28840	They carried a banner on which could be read this strange device We are seeking our	148.8544158935547
8587/28840	The next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three	170.99436950683594
8588/28840	That was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of	187.10311889648438
8589/28840	On the first day of that month our four companions had landed at Boulogne and in two parties had set out for	65.64806365966797
8590/28840	Toward the end of the fourth day of the journey Athos and Aramis reached Nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queens	124.48269653320312
8591/28840	On reaching the capital Athos and Aramis found it in	70.00830078125
8592/28840	The sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his	122.39644622802734
8593/28840	The sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said   Who are you gentlemen   Two	84.31536102294922
8594/28840	And where do you come from   From	79.1904525756836
8595/28840	And what are you going to do in Paris   We are going with a mission to Her Majesty the Queen of	23.56107521057129
8596/28840	Ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of	50.4371223449707
8597/28840	We have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her	178.4757843017578
8598/28840	Where are your passports   We have none we left England ignorant of the state of politics here having left Paris before the departure of the	99.67356872558594
8599/28840	Ah said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are Mazarinists who are sent as	81.97830200195312
8600/28840	My dear friend here Athos spoke rest assured if we were Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of	183.45562744140625
8601/28840	In your situation distrust those who are well provided with every form	152.40292358398438
8602/28840	Enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the	107.49845123291016
8603/28840	The guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some	628.1569213867188
8604/28840	In a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded Athos and Aramis and an officer was examining their	95.2281723022461
8605/28840	The first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each	88.5978012084961
8606/28840	The first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the	140.94638061523438
8607/28840	When the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two Mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to	63.36682891845703
8608/28840	Be it so said Athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible	61.57133102416992
8609/28840	There seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to Her Majesty the Queen of England and if she engages to answer for us I presume we shall be allowed to	49.673702239990234
8610/28840	On hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than	98.437255859375
8611/28840	Merciful goodness whispered Aramis to Athos did you see   What asked Ath	61.14259719848633
8612/28840	The face of the shortest of those three gentlemen  	47.927669525146484
8613/28840	At this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said   The passports are in order let these three gentlemen	87.83143615722656
8614/28840	The three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this	65.25025177001953
8615/28840	Aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of Ath	66.47687530517578
8616/28840	What is the matter with you my friend asked the	24.668516159057617
8617/28840	I havedoubtless I am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out   Only by their passports they are three Frondists who are gone to rejoin the Duc de Longue	69.36264038085938
8618/28840	Tis strange said Aramis almost involuntarily I fancied that I recognized Mazarin	73.71829986572266
8619/28840	The sergeant burst into a fit of	84.62208557128906
8620/28840	He he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung Not so foolish as all	172.7391357421875
8621/28840	Ah muttered Athos I may be mistaken I havent the unerring eye of DArtagn	35.6376838684082
8622/28840	Who is speaking of Monsieur DArtagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the	24.07091522216797
8623/28840	What cried Aramis and Athos what Planchet   Planchet added Grimaud Planchet with a gorget indeed   Ah gentlemen cried Planchet so you are back again in	24.716785430908203
8624/28840	No sir I am sure he hasnt yet	90.97109985351562
8625/28840	But then he may have stopped at Saint Germ	41.40309143066406
8626/28840	I dont think so we appointed to meet at La Chev	80.32154846191406
8627/28840	And had the pretty Madeleine no news asked Aramis	86.51234436035156
8628/28840	No sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very	69.90082550048828
8629/28840	In fact said Aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey	115.6094741821289
8630/28840	Permit me then my dear Athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to	58.892154693603516
8631/28840	Ah monsieur le chevalier said Planchet b	7.601607322692871
8632/28840	Lieutenant with a promise of becoming	566.0730590820312
8633/28840	So owing to your popularity   No thanks to something	92.24837493896484
8634/28840	You know gentlemen that I served the Piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant  	43.99013137817383
8635/28840	Well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left I succeeded I did in making them all begin with the same foot and I was made lieutenant on the	133.57032775878906
8636/28840	So I presume said Athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you  	39.30736541748047
8637/28840	There are the Prince de Conti the Duc de Longueville the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon the Marechal de la Mothe the Marquis de Sevigne and I dont know who for my	17.590171813964844
8638/28840	And the Vicomte Raoul de Bragelonne inquired Athos in a tremulous	17.699499130249023
8639/28840	DArtagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in	40.04594802856445
8640/28840	Yes count nor have I lost sight of him for a single instant	93.75354766845703
8641/28840	Then said Athos in a tone of delight he is well no accident has happened to him   None	37.63361740112305
8642/28840	And he lives   Still at the Hotel of the Great Charlem	51.6057014465332
8643/28840	And passes his time   Sometimes with the queen of England sometimes with Madame de Chevre	64.20333099365234
8644/28840	He and the Count de Guiche are like each others	46.22700119018555
8645/28840	Thanks Planchet thanks cried Athos extending his hand to the	25.9945125579834
8646/28840	Oh sir Planchet only touched the tips of the counts	76.50383758544922
8647/28840	Well what are you doing countto a former lackey   My friend said Athos he has given me news of Ra	39.892696380615234
8648/28840	And now gentlemen said Planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do   Reenter Paris if you will let us my good Planc	36.749549865722656
8649/28840	Let you sir Now as ever I am nothing but your	154.52679443359375
8650/28840	Then turning to his men   Allow these gentlemen to pass he said they are friends of the Duc de Beau	41.23624801635742
8651/28840	Long live the Duc de Beaufort cried the sentin	23.220928192138672
8652/28840	Take notice captain he continued giving Planchet his expected title take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these	176.8731231689453
8653/28840	And I said Planchet with dignity I know them and I answer for	49.416072845458984
8654/28840	As he said this he pressed Grimauds hand who seemed honored by the	129.00694274902344
8655/28840	Farewell till we meet again said Aramis as they took leave of Planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for	91.958251953125
8656/28840	Sir said Planchet I am in all things at your	18.60171890258789
8657/28840	That fellow is no fool said Aramis as he got on his	72.65576171875
8658/28840	How should he be replied Athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your	218.7352752685547
8659/28840	The two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the Lou	118.43717193603516
8660/28840	They reached the queens apartments but were compelled to stop in the antechamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from	116.45989227294922
8661/28840	We too said Athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring news from England but have just come from	80.95903778076172
8662/28840	What then are your names gentlemen   The Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay said Aram	7.70517110824585
8663/28840	Ah in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and I think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a	56.144962310791016
8664/28840	Please follow me and he went on before followed by Athos and Aram	32.55935287475586
8665/28840	On hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen	65.4952621459961
8666/28840	Oh let them come in let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the	58.73076629638672
8667/28840	The poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other	132.04244995117188
8668/28840	Come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door	396.5181579589844
8669/28840	All these gentlemen had been noticed by Athos and Aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low	30.798967361450195
8670/28840	Aramis and Athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens	56.40637969970703
8671/28840	Go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the Duc de Chat	41.35072708129883
8672/28840	You said that His Majesty King Charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects   Yes madame Chatillon stammered	70.67412567138672
8673/28840	Athos and Aramis were more and more	68.0816650390625
8674/28840	And that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queenoh my lord oh my kingand that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant	90.43859100341797
8675/28840	Just so madame replied Chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this	60.560333251953125
8676/28840	The queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mothers neck and kissed herher own eyes streaming with	155.97927856445312
8677/28840	Now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said Chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of Ath	104.0299301147461
8678/28840	One momentI begfor here are the Chevalier dHerblay and the Comte de la Fere just arrived from London and they can give you as eyewitnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal	46.27823257446289
8679/28840	Speak gentlemen speakI am listening conceal nothing gloss over	1011.306396484375
8680/28840	Since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to	102.03663635253906
8681/28840	Athos turned pale and laid his hand on his	67.648193359375
8682/28840	Well exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his pal	125.7093505859375
8683/28840	Speak sir I beg you to do	73.8926773071289
8684/28840	I beg you to excuse me madame I wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been	56.67906951904297
8685/28840	Mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken what has happened then   Sir interposed Monsieur de Flamarens to Athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the	46.8282356262207
8686/28840	I do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rightsthat would be to accuse Her Majesty Queen Anne of	122.33097839355469
8687/28840	With the queen sir replied Athos in his calm vibrating	125.34351348876953
8688/28840	Explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every	555.4083251953125
8689/28840	On your brow I read despairyour lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidingsyour hands trem	417.8182678222656
8690/28840	Oh my God my God what has happened   Lord ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us   Sir said Chatillon if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the	48.98783493041992
8691/28840	Aramis went so close to Chatillon as almost to touch	243.5719451904297
8692/28840	We ought not therefore I think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier	210.6346893310547
8693/28840	Queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy	209.81961059570312
8694/28840	Athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to Lord de Winter and the wedding ring which Charles	88.72801208496094
8695/28840	before his death had placed in the hands of Aram	26.12428855895996
8696/28840	Since the moment he had first received these two mementoes Athos had never parted with	112.45748138427734
8697/28840	He opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent	134.35397338867188
8698/28840	The queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lipsand without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her	76.45182800292969
8699/28840	Now chevalier he added turning to Aramis let us	20.43857192993164
8700/28840	said Aramis we have still a word to say to these	44.11796951293945
8701/28840	And turning to Chatillon Sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something I cannot say before the	75.50369262695312
8702/28840	Chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground	69.9483413696289
8703/28840	Sir said Aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary	49.61063003540039
8704/28840	That would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a	72.03135681152344
8705/28840	You know well that I dont like to leave things half	193.99830627441406
8706/28840	Conclude then sir answered De Chatillon with as much hauteur as Aram	193.4252471923828
8707/28840	Gentlemen resumed Aramis any one but the Comte de la Fere and myself would have had you arrestedfor we have friends in Parisbut we are contented with another	84.34705352783203
8708/28840	Come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted terr	146.42440795898438
8709/28840	I know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept	66.80146789550781
8710/28840	And why not said Aramis in his tone of ra	37.676673889160156
8711/28840	Is it Mazarins proximity that makes you so prudent   Oh you hear that Flamarens said Chat	45.99296188354492
8712/28840	Not to reply would be a blot on my name and my	83.98825073242188
8713/28840	You will not reply however and these gentlemen I am sure will presently be of my	72.56217956542969
8714/28840	Aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insol	40.013404846191406
8715/28840	Chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his	110.18989562988281
8716/28840	Duke said Flamarens you forget that tomorrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the	114.08897399902344
8717/28840	Until tomorrow evening you are not at your own	176.25717163085938
8718/28840	Let it be then the day after tomorrow said Aram	47.88789749145508
8719/28840	Tomorrow rather said De Chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of Charent	34.17975616455078
8720/28840	How can you doubt it sir For the pleasure of a meeting with you I would go to the end of the	42.698577880859375
8721/28840	Are you going to rejoin your cardinal Swear first on your honor not to inform him of our	89.1806869506836
8722/28840	Conditions   Why not   Because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors	67.56144714355469
8723/28840	Then let us draw on the	45.848609924316406
8724/28840	It is all one to usto us who do not command tomorrows	281.7439880371094
8725/28840	Chatillon and Flamarens looked at each	72.66182708740234
8726/28840	For what reason is all this fume and fury asked Ath	117.13410949707031
8727/28840	What have they done to you   Theydid you not see what they did  	42.656532287597656
8728/28840	They laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in	157.93663024902344
8729/28840	Now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the	84.19628143310547
8730/28840	However Im glad not to fight them until	407.2809753417969
8731/28840	I hope we shall have something better to do tonight than to draw the	51.13488006591797
8732/28840	What have we to do   Egad to take Maz	50.153648376464844
8733/28840	These undertakings do not suit me as you know Aram	56.10184860229492
8734/28840	Why   Because it is taking people unaw	117.37744140625
8735/28840	Really Athos you would make a singular	92.4007339477539
8736/28840	You would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the	251.52577209472656
8737/28840	You know one cannot change his nature he	244.6947479248047
8738/28840	Besides do you know what is our situation and whether Mazarins arrest wouldnt be rather an encumbrance than an advantage   Say at once you disapprove of my	98.22813415527344
8739/28840	I think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let Mazarin know that we were in	94.38754272460938
8740/28840	I have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite	335.4254455566406
8741/28840	Where   Either to seek the Duc de Beaufort or the Duc de Bouillon and to tell them about	30.10433006286621
8742/28840	Yes but on one conditionthat we begin by the coadj	38.30841827392578
8743/28840	He is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him	105.58499908447266
8744/28840	It was then agreed that they were to go first to Monsieur de Bouillon as his house came first but first of all Athos begged that he might go to the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne to see Ra	42.601783752441406
8745/28840	They reentered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence proceeded to the Halles and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois they went on foot to the Rue Gueneg	29.15741729736328
8746/28840	But Raoul was not at the Hotel du Grand Charlem	15.861156463623047
8747/28840	He had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with Olivain the instant he had received	54.85469436645508
8748/28840	The night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of	116.60670471191406
8749/28840	On seeing them Athos and Aramis stood	43.08878707885742
8750/28840	Oh cried Aramis do you see count   Yes said Ath	18.351444244384766
8751/28840	Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be   What do you think Aramis   Why they are our	31.755388259887695
8752/28840	You are not mistaken I recognize Monsieur de Flamaren	11.785116195678711
8753/28840	As to the cavalier in the brown cloak   It is the	26.218116760253906
8754/28840	How the devil do they venture so near the Hotel de Bouillon   Athos smiled but did not	33.3602294921875
8755/28840	Five minutes afterward they knocked at the princes	185.5023956298828
8756/28840	This door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the Prince de Contis	62.83843231201172
8757/28840	He was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of	107.37626647949219
8758/28840	Everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better Monsieur de Bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to	86.04527282714844
8759/28840	Meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his	38.38038635253906
8760/28840	Ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the	65.6988525390625
8761/28840	But I as you see am nailed to my bedah this demon goutthis demon gout   My lord said Athos we are just arrived from England and our first concern is to inquire after your	91.80289459228516
8762/28840	Thanks gentlemen thanks As you see my health is but	649.8253784179688
8763/28840	And King Charles is well as I have just heard   He is dead my lord said Aram	19.602506637573242
8764/28840	Pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it	49.78908157348633
8765/28840	Dead on the scaffold condemned by	97.29803466796875
8766/28840	Impossible   And executed in our	239.62847900390625
8767/28840	What then has Monsieur de Flamarens been telling me   Monsieur de Flamarens   Yes he has just gone	14.169364929199219
8768/28840	With two companions yes replied the d	57.8408317565918
8769/28840	Then he added with a certain uneasiness Did you meet them   Why yes I think soin the street said Athos and he looked smilingly at Aramis who looked at him with an expression of	30.372974395751953
8770/28840	The devil take this gout cried Monsieur de Bouillon evidently ill at	69.79601287841797
8771/28840	My lord said Athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much	66.07296752929688
8772/28840	One must replied Monsieur de Bouillon sacrifice ones comfort to the public good but I confess to you I am now almost	92.35166931152344
8773/28840	My spirit is willing my head is clear but this demon the gout oercrows	299.53546142578125

8775/28840	I am even sorry that this evening I almost repulsedbut there will be a conference tomorrow and we shall	71.21528625488281
8776/28840	Go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your	96.10630798339844
8777/28840	Poor King Charles But after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that France has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve	115.99185943603516
8778/28840	Oh as to that said Aramis we are	55.0064582824707
8779/28840	Mazarin especially   Yes do you know I am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreignerwell he would be more justly	96.6001205444336
8780/28840	Oh the devil take this gout   Athos and Aramis took their leave but even in the antechamber they could still hear the dukes cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the	38.29225540161133
8781/28840	When they reached the street Aramis said   Well Athos what do you think   Of whom   Pardieu of Monsieur de Bou	24.51333236694336
8782/28840	My friend I think that he is much troubled with g	78.93280792236328
8783/28840	You noticed that I didnt breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit   You did well you would have caused him an access of his	76.1092300415039
8784/28840	Let us go to Monsieur de Beau	11.983954429626465
8785/28840	The two friends went to the Hotel de Vend	25.936233520507812
8786/28840	It was ten oclock when they	27.001083374023438
8787/28840	The Hotel de Vendome was not less guarded than the Hotel de Bouillon and presented as warlike an	58.29906463623047
8788/28840	There were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses sadd	60.74412536621094
8789/28840	Two horsemen going out as Athos and Aramis entered were obliged to give place to	45.403934478759766
8790/28840	Ah ah gentlemen said Aramis decidedly it is a night for	127.66049194335938
8791/28840	We shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting	210.60597229003906
8792/28840	Oh as to that sir replied Chatillon for it was he who with Flamarens was leaving the Duc de Beaufort you may be assured for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing	55.15900421142578
8793/28840	I hope that is true said Aram	17.325498580932617
8794/28840	As for me I am sure of it said the d	17.6689395904541
8795/28840	De Flamarens and De Chatillon continued on their way and Athos and Aramis dis	22.481121063232422
8796/28840	Comte de la Fere the man cried out Chevalier dHerblay How does it happen that you are in Paris   Rochefort cried the two	18.793853759765625
8797/28840	Yes we arrived four or five days ago from the Vendomois as you know and we are going to give Mazarin something to	45.39079284667969
8798/28840	You are still with us I presume   More than	57.82047653198242
8799/28840	And the duke   Furious against the	53.10566711425781
8800/28840	You know his successour dear duke He is really king of Paris he cant go out without being mobbed by his admire	298.411376953125
8801/28840	Ah so much the better Can we have the honor of seeing his highness   I shall be proud to present you and Rochefort walked	30.60781478881836
8802/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends	42.319129943847656
8803/28840	Ah he cried by Jove youre welcome sir	169.28524780273438

8805/28840	You know Noirmont do you not The successor of Father Marteau who makes the excellent pies you know	59.434627532958984
8806/28840	Boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for La Rame	80.16183471679688
8807/28840	Thank God we dont want either rope ladders or gagpears	986.5059814453125
8808/28840	My lord said Athos do not let us disturb	27.763465881347656
8809/28840	We came merely to inquire after your health and to take your	160.6282196044922
8810/28840	My lord said Athos we are satisfied we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordships service and his most faithful	61.88914108276367
8811/28840	My most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends you have proved	168.75662231445312
8812/28840	And if ever I am reconciled with the court I shall prove to you I hope that I remain your friend as well as that ofwhat the devil are their namesDArtagnan and Porthos   DArtagnan and Porth	29.579544067382812
8813/28840	You understand then Comte de la Fere you understand Chevalier dHerblay that I am altogether and always at your	20.60993766784668
8814/28840	Athos and Aramis bowed and went	61.204872131347656
8815/28840	Let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said Aram	44.72622299194336
8816/28840	They directed their horses to the	110.86651611328125
8817/28840	On arriving at the cradle from which Paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a	131.60462951660156
8818/28840	The palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied ones self not in Paris but in	77.72023010253906
8819/28840	Some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with	95.40721130371094
8820/28840	The friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their	254.27281188964844
8821/28840	The palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the	107.60891723632812
8822/28840	Thus did Athos and Aramis make their appearance in the antechamber where about a dozen noblemen were collected in	61.94990158081055
8823/28840	Good heavens said Aramis to Athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his antechamber   My dear friend we must take people as we find	61.64006805419922
8824/28840	The coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of Paris and has a	50.86431121826172
8825/28840	Let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of	72.6104965209961
8826/28840	Let us call one of these lackeys with a demipistole in the left	63.77602767944336
8827/28840	Ah if Im not mistaken heres Baz	204.88693237304688
8828/28840	Bazin who was crossing the antechamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing	87.01405334472656
8829/28840	A truce to compliments said Aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in	55.979888916015625
8830/28840	Certainly sirit is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the antechamber only just now he has a secret conference with Monsieur de Bru	52.42380905151367
8831/28840	De Bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said Aramis so we give it	61.020294189453125
8832/28840	And they hastened to quit the palace followed by Bazin who was lavish of bows and	65.06243133544922
8833/28840	Well said Athos when Aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting Mazarin   You are wisdom incarnate Athos Aramis	56.603416442871094
8834/28840	What had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of France in the terrible events which had occurred in England which they thought should have arrested the attention of all	77.71826934814453
8835/28840	In fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the Louvre no one appeared to be aware that Charles	89.11985778808594
8836/28840	had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaff	45.42220687866211
8837/28840	The two friends made an appointment for ten oclock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left Athos to enter	67.2322006225586
8838/28840	At ten oclock the next day they met	47.01482391357422
8839/28840	Athos had been out since six o	156.8952178955078
8840/28840	Well have you any news Athos	103.35012817382812
8841/28840	No one has seen DArtagnan and Porthos has not	20.31138038635254
8842/28840	In fact said Athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we	112.22933197021484
8843/28840	Add to that DArtagnans rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting	38.81519317626953
8844/28840	He expected you will remember to be here on the	77.83415985107422
8845/28840	And here we are at the	90.28516387939453
8846/28840	This evening the margin of possible delay	434.72918701171875
8847/28840	What do you think should be done asked Athos if we have no news of them tonight   Pardieu we must go and look for	29.413822174072266
8848/28840	A light cloud passed over the counts	157.0587921142578
8849/28840	Raoul gives me much uneasiness he	101.34815979003906
8850/28840	He received yesterday a message from the Prince de Condé he went to meet him at Saint Cloud and has not	62.41830825805664
8851/28840	Have you seen Madame de Chevreuse   She was not at	22.141508102416992
8852/28840	And you Aramis you were going I think to visit Madame de Longue	36.45795822143555
8853/28840	Well   She was no longer there but she had left her new	56.575950622558594
8854/28840	Where was she   Guess I give you a thousand	92.59700775146484
8855/28840	How should I know where the most beautiful and active of the Frondists was at midnight for I presume it was when you left me that you went to visit	65.31702423095703
8856/28840	At the Hotel de Ville my dear	34.146060943603516
8857/28840	You didnt tell me of that Aram	124.55810546875
8858/28840	Really It was my forgetfulness then pardon	208.03823852539062
8859/28840	Now asked Athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening Here we are without occupation it seems to	63.910491943359375
8860/28840	You forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of Charenton I hope to see Monsieur de Chatillon whom Ive hated for a long time	33.26981735229492
8861/28840	Why have you hated him   Because he is the brother of Colign	46.3346061706543
8862/28840	Ah true he who presumed to be a rival of yours for which he was severely punished that ought to satisfy	90.91915130615234
8863/28840	Yes but it does not I am rancorousthe only stigma that proves me to be a church	94.67381286621094
8864/28840	Do you understand You understand that you are in no way obliged to go with	64.14469909667969
8865/28840	Come now said Athos you are	42.387855529785156
8866/28840	I supposed said Athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike	252.8362579345703
8867/28840	No doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the	310.3106994628906
8868/28840	Come come dear Athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your Raoul were to be involved in this	89.81249237060547
8869/28840	Well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with DArtagnan Porthos and possibly even Ra	58.79448318481445
8870/28840	Stop there are a fine body of citizens passing quite attractive by Jupiter and their captainsee he has the true military	245.2421112060547

8872/28840	Question him about the fight said Ath	87.3866195678711
8873/28840	This day will be a warm one said Planchet in a warlike	59.17838668823242
8874/28840	No doubt said Aramis but it is far from here to the	45.182743072509766
8875/28840	Sir the distance will be diminished said a	249.64942932128906
8876/28840	Aramis saluted then turning toward Athos   I dont care to camp on the Place Royale with all these people he	58.50279998779297
8877/28840	Shall we go forward We shall see better what is going	88.04261016845703
8878/28840	And then Monsieur de Chatillon will not come to the Place Royale to look for	21.852458953857422
8879/28840	Come then my friend we will go	93.31275939941406
8880/28840	Havent you something to say to Monsieur de Flamarens on your own account   My friend said Athos I have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely	40.32505798339844
8881/28840	And how long ago was that   When I last drew my poni	91.99737548828125
8882/28840	Ah Good another souvenir of Monsieur Mord	93.83744812011719
8883/28840	Well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that	132.62371826171875
8884/28840	Hush said Athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him let us talk no more of Mordauntit will bring bad	66.72486877441406
8885/28840	And Athos set forward toward Charenton followed closely by Aram	100.73137664794922
8886/28840	As Athos and Aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of	63.59794616699219
8887/28840	There is now a truce and a	161.18902587890625
8888/28840	The prince Monsieur de Retz the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon are talking over public	26.513952255249023
8889/28840	Now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case I shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet	91.47359466552734
8890/28840	Sir said Aramis you speak to the	27.194883346557617
8891/28840	Allow me to ask you a question Where are the plenipotentiaries   At Charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of	44.461952209472656
8892/28840	And was this conference arranged beforehand   No gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which Mazarin made last night to the Paris	79.25421905517578
8893/28840	Athos and Aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made	86.88817596435547
8894/28840	And that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked Athos belongs to   To Monsieur de Chanleu who commands your troops at Charent	42.981624603271484
8895/28840	I say your troops for I presume that you gentlemen are Frondeurs   Yes almost said Aram	39.74683380126953
8896/28840	We are for the king and the princes added Ath	75.59800720214844
8897/28840	We must understand each other said the d	37.353179931640625
8898/28840	The king is with us and his generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Condé although I must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one	92.66936492919922
8899/28840	Sir since you command the cavalry   Pardon me I am commanderinch	62.982120513916016
8900/28840	You must know all your officersI mean those more	359.7841491699219
8901/28840	I knew that but I supposed he had	92.23526763916016

8903/28840	I can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and Monsieur de Cambon the substitute for Monsieur dArtagnan still holds his	41.29888153076172
8904/28840	The two friends looked at each	29.96078109741211
8905/28840	It is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the	53.75429916381836
8906/28840	If we have no news of them this evening tomorrow we must	57.87879180908203
8907/28840	Yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte   Yes sir answered Athos agitated so much so that I wish to see him if	23.63766860961914
8908/28840	Quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and I will conduct you to	90.78567504882812
8909/28840	Halloo there cried Aramis turning around what a noise behind us   A body of cavaliers is coming toward us said Chat	105.21174621582031
8910/28840	I recognize the coadjutor by his Frondist	43.53742218017578
8911/28840	And I the Duc de Beaufort by his white plume of ostrich	60.45975112915039
8912/28840	They are coming full gallop the prince is with themah he is leaving them   They are beating the rappel cried Chatillon we must discover what is going	102.36640930175781
8913/28840	In fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the drums beat the Duc de Beaufort drew his	116.96477508544922
8914/28840	On his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the Parisian troops ran to	132.5655517578125
8915/28840	Farewell till the next time we meet cried Chatillon and he set off full gall	126.54151916503906
8916/28840	Athos and Aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the Duc de Beau	30.80385971069336
8917/28840	As to the Duc de Bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to Paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the Duc dElbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a	53.99586868286133
8918/28840	Meantime between Charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the	113.00782775878906
8919/28840	Gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar theres the enemy	141.80813598632812
8920/28840	Let us save them half of their	353.8952331542969
8921/28840	And without caring whether he were followed or not he set off his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of Corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the	77.39691925048828
8922/28840	Monsieur de Beaufort sent his cavalry toward Etampes and Monsieur de Chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt a sort	62.570945739746094
8923/28840	The battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of val	141.70660400390625
8924/28840	His proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against	101.22403717041016
8925/28840	Chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the Duc de Chatillon in	89.15440368652344
8926/28840	This charge was so fierce so skillfully conducted that Chanleu was almost	331.2530822753906
8927/28840	He commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally	156.10621643066406
8928/28840	Suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pelemele the intrenchments with the fug	198.0578155517578
8929/28840	Aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with	132.55987548828125
8930/28840	His bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deedannihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise	211.94972229003906
8931/28840	On the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in	91.7219467163086
8932/28840	The cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon Aramis and struck a blow that Aramis parried with his wonted	74.06867980957031
8933/28840	Ah tis you Monsieur de Chatillon cried the chevalier welcome to youI expected	31.900924682617188
8934/28840	I hope I have not made you wait too long sir said the duke at all events here I	32.72163391113281
8935/28840	Monsieur de Chatillon cried Aramis taking from his saddlebags a second pistol I think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead	45.22612380981445
8936/28840	Thank God sir they are not   And the duke pointing his pistol at Aramis	72.44567108154297
8937/28840	But Aramis bent his head the instant he saw the dukes finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching	91.80000305175781
8938/28840	Oh youve missed me cried Aramis but I swear to Heaven I will not miss	48.3973388671875
8939/28840	If I give you time cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn	57.74203872680664
8940/28840	Aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and Athos who saw the duke advancing toward Aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out Fire fire then when the shot was	50.30805587768555
8941/28840	De Chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his	21.582061767578125
8942/28840	The ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuir	87.88565063476562
8943/28840	I am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the	29.684938430786133
8944/28840	I told you this I am now grieved I have kept my	60.81614303588867
8945/28840	Can I be of any use to you   Chatillon made a sign with his hand and Aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the	53.01949691772461
8946/28840	He turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming Raoul   Raoul cried Ath	58.4476203918457
8947/28840	The young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the Chevalier dHerblay two officers in the Parisian forces rushed at that instant on Raoul but Aramis protected him with his	36.948516845703125
8948/28840	Athos took his sons horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the	83.77938079833984
8949/28840	At this crisis of the battle the prince who had been seconding De Chatillon in the second line appeared in the midst of the fight his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the	134.5904541015625
8950/28840	On seeing him the regiment of Corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the Parisian forces put them into confusion and reentered Charenton	38.79877471923828
8951/28840	The coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by Athos Raoul and Aram	87.47683715820312
8952/28840	Aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutors misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when Athos stopped	88.68685913085938
8953/28840	On on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the Fronde	84.80943298339844
8954/28840	The three cavaliers continued their road on full gall	99.3942642211914
8955/28840	It was then that he told me two cavaliers of the Parisian army were seeking me and named the Comte de la F	28.65212059020996
8956/28840	What you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier   I did not recognize the chevalier in armor sir said Raoul blushing though I might have known him by his skill and coolness in	42.74053192138672
8957/28840	Thank you for the compliment my young friend replied Aramis we can see from whom you learned	125.49331665039062
8958/28840	Then you were going to Rueil   Yes I have a despatch from the prince to his em	23.573139190673828
8959/28840	You must still deliver it said Ath	89.33338928222656
8960/28840	No false generosity count the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very desp	111.64885711669922
8961/28840	This young man must not however fail in his duty said Ath	93.12419891357422
8962/28840	In the first place count this youth is our prisoner you seem to forget	142.80630493164062
8963/28840	What I propose to do is fair in war the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of	176.18020629882812
8964/28840	The young man hesitated and looked at Athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of	91.62708282470703
8965/28840	Give him the despatch Raoul you are the chevaliers	109.91240692138672
8966/28840	Raoul gave it up reluctantly Aramis instantly seized and read	247.66778564453125
8967/28840	You he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to	95.78723907470703
8968/28840	Athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about DArtagnan conquered his unwillingness to read	68.62237548828125
8969/28840	My lord I shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of Monsieur de Comminges the ten men you	39.29616165161133
8970/28840	They are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful	170.59017944335938
8971/28840	Yes let us search Paris and especially inquire of Planchet if he has yet heard from his former	131.94375610351562
8972/28840	That poor Planchet You speak of him very much at your ease Aramis he has probably been	87.69802856445312
8973/28840	All those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massac	204.2954559326172
8974/28840	On leaving Paris Athos and Aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of	88.99980163574219
8975/28840	Besides they felt that the _dénouement_ of this second Odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to	65.07778930664062
8976/28840	Besides there was no tranquillity in Paris	57.20467758178711
8977/28840	Provisions began to fail and whenever one of the Prince de Contis generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his	162.3497772216797
8978/28840	In one of these risings the Duc de Beaufort pillaged the house and library of Mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw	62.606163024902344
8979/28840	Athos and Aramis left Paris after this coupdetat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the Parisians had been beaten at Charent	47.99458694458008
8980/28840	They quitted Paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine agitated by fear torn by	684.0946044921875
8981/28840	Having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to Boulogne at Abbeville and followed it step by step examining every	209.81021118164062
8982/28840	Nevertheless they were still in a state of	45.48503112792969
8983/28840	Several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at Montreuil Athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate	261.8214416503906
8984/28840	He turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife  	111.02877044677734
8985/28840	This is capital said Athos to Aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe must push	73.6581802368164
8986/28840	There the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed   Trust me said Aramis do not expect to find anything in Abbe	129.57972717285156
8987/28840	If we had only been looking for Porthos Porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced	41.1407356262207
8988/28840	But DArtagnan is devoid of such	38.77931594848633
8989/28840	Porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere	74.97000122070312
8990/28840	His noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon	171.2060089111328
8991/28840	They had not looked carefully enough for their lost	369.0373229980469
8992/28840	They had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their	181.8162078857422
8993/28840	Oh exclaimed Athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was DArtagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in	91.8158950805664
8994/28840	Had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken	131.77317810058594
8995/28840	You are right Aramis let us travel	45.99034118652344
8996/28840	To describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be	119.6806869506836
8997/28840	Uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of Athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aram	136.07180786132812
8998/28840	They galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the	34.807647705078125
8999/28840	All at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous	114.98603057861328
9000/28840	It had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant	458.07952880859375
9001/28840	Oh he said looking at the stone this is the work of either Hercules or Porth	62.60935592651367
9002/28840	Let us get down count and examine this	295.53912353515625
9003/28840	The stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it	224.48703002929688
9004/28840	With the assistance of Blaisois and Grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone	108.9214096069336
9005/28840	Upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words   Eight of the light dragoons are pursuing	102.408447265625
9006/28840	If we reach Compiegne we shall stop at the Peac	52.57882308959961
9007/28840	It is kept by a friend of	101.97052764892578
9008/28840	At last we have something definite said Athos let us go to the Peac	56.81357955932617
9009/28840	Yes answered Aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost brokenwind	70.43062591552734
9010/28840	Aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off	150.3628692626953
9011/28840	The men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported	681.7278442382812
9012/28840	In six hours they reached Compiegne and alighted at the Peac	40.36037826538086
9013/28840	The host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a Chin	131.87461853027344
9014/28840	They asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rap	70.68989562988281
9015/28840	Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the	99.58938598632812
9016/28840	I see that you are the friends of these	29.42353630065918
9017/28840	Well what has happened to them   They were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the	37.47629165649414
9018/28840	Eight said Aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as Porthos and DArtagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight	47.29754638671875
9019/28840	The eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of Italians in the kings service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by	119.06484985351562
9020/28840	Tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said Aram	80.6490249633789
9021/28840	Toward the town of Louvres was the	217.3374481201172
9022/28840	The two friends having agreed to leave Blaisois and Grimaud at Compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to Louv	78.23416137695312
9023/28840	Here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that	145.67971801757812
9024/28840	DArtagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur and at the same time leaving some trace of	65.08344268798828
9025/28840	They went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counteras their friends must have done before	101.16497802734375
9026/28840	The counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin Rue	131.74729919433594
9027/28840	Let us go to Rueil said Ath	44.799564361572266

9045/28840	It is this answered Athos with a trembling	41.772132873535156

9167/28840	Must we then asked Anne of Austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times   Mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the ministers proposal	180.41299438476562

9186/28840	In the first place I have as a precaution shut up at Rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable	103.1304702758789
9187/28840	Today the third will be there	128.8299560546875
9188/28840	As long as they are in prison all will be well said Anne but one of these days they will get	63.056732177734375
9189/28840	Ah exclaimed Anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets Paris   Why so   On account of the Bastile sir which is so strong and so	84.4964370727539
9190/28840	Madame these conferences will bring us peace when we have peace we shall regain Paris with Paris the Bastile and our four bullies shall rot	195.95816040039062
9191/28840	Anne frowned slightly when Mazarin in taking leave kissed her	318.96453857421875
9192/28840	Mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went	1822.7158203125
9193/28840	Anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her	91.65391540527344
9194/28840	I once she said despised the love of a cardinal who never said I shall do but I have done so and	92.96439361572266
9195/28840	That man knew of retreats more secure than Rueil darker and more silent even than the Bast	192.62863159179688
9196/28840	After quitting Anne Mazarin took the road to Rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised	148.0079345703125
9197/28840	In military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome	149.65478515625
9198/28840	In the court of the old Chateau of Saint Germain he entered his coach and reached the Seine at Chat	66.92813873291016
9199/28840	The prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queens generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at	189.25584411621094
9200/28840	Athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by Comminges followed the cardinal in	108.27623748779297
9201/28840	Grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near Aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had	86.38818359375
9202/28840	Grimaud had indeed during twentytwo years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than Athoss imminent death was likely to make him	157.8457489013672
9203/28840	At the branching off of the road toward Paris Aramis who had followed in the cardinals suite turned	86.55113220214844
9204/28840	Mazarin went to the right hand and Aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the	129.88978576660156
9205/28840	Athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back	209.66839599609375
9206/28840	The two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and Aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow Athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his	65.35037994384766
9207/28840	Ten minutes afterward Mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at Rueil as he alighted Comminges approached	42.865196228027344
9208/28840	My lord he asked where does your eminence wish Monsieur Comte de la Fere to be lodged   In the pavilion of the orangery of course in front of the pavilion where the guard	26.383899688720703
9209/28840	I wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the	88.39583587646484
9210/28840	My lord answered Comminges he begs to be taken to the place where Monsieur dArtagnan is confinedthat is in the hunting lodge opposite the orang	39.193511962890625
9211/28840	Tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with Frondeurs nor any interest in the Fr	180.60519409179688
9212/28840	If we put these three men together Monsieur Comminges said Mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodig	60.8885383605957
9213/28840	Comminges smiled Mazarin read and construed that	626.6963500976562
9214/28840	You do not know these men Monsieur Comminges but I know them first personally also by hears	105.54780578613281
9215/28840	I sent them to carry aid to King Charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among	142.00164794921875
9216/28840	But since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison   In prison said Mazarin and when has Rueil been a prison   Ever since there were prisoners in it answered Comm	97.54364013671875
9217/28840	These gentlemen Comminges are not prisoners returned Mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that I have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my	112.7470474243164
9218/28840	Well while taking my walk I will call on him and we will	139.05079650878906
9219/28840	Although he professes to be my enemy I have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange	98.31819915771484
9220/28840	Comminges bowed and returned to Athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the	70.3458023071289
9221/28840	Sir replied Comminges it seems that it is	33.55097961425781
9222/28840	Monsieur de Comminges said Athos I have been a soldier all my life and I know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render	44.11237335205078
9223/28840	I am entirely at your service except only for my	93.1453857421875
9224/28840	Thank you sir what I am about to ask will not compromise you in any	58.012882232666016
9225/28840	If it should even compromise me a little said Monsieur de Comminges with a smile still make your	75.57198333740234
9226/28840	I dont like Mazarin any better than you	85.42888641357422
9227/28840	I serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal but I serve the one with joy and the other against my	85.339111328125
9228/28840	Speak then I beg of you I wait and	223.3856964111328
9229/28840	Since there is no harm said Athos in my knowing that DArtagnan is here I presume there will be none in his knowing that I am	33.607933044433594
9230/28840	I have received no orders on that	86.83760833740234
9231/28840	Well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that I am his	73.90042877197266
9232/28840	Which cannot last interrupted Comminges the cardinal said so there is no prison	136.08705139160156
9233/28840	But there are oubliettes replied Athos	54.76661682128906
9234/28840	Oh thats a different thing yes I know there are traditions of that sort said Comm	99.99556732177734
9235/28840	It was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our Mazarinimpossible an Italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as	68.75089263916016
9236/28840	Oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a lowborn fellow such as he is would not have recourse to	115.76863098144531
9237/28840	Your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known and all the nobility of France would demand an explanation of your	80.65325164794922
9238/28840	No no be easy on that	118.22884368896484
9239/28840	I will however inform Monsieur dArtagnan of your arrival	28.66449546813965
9240/28840	Comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orang	32.338523864746094
9241/28840	They passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and court	94.11052703857422
9242/28840	From the ends of these two wings extended the	203.84812927246094
9243/28840	Athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by Comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where DArtagnan was	78.41889190673828
9244/28840	For a long time I had these words whispered in my ears and I chose the latter at any rate it is a French	82.55077362060547
9245/28840	Poor DArtagnan said Athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he	51.47410583496094
9246/28840	You have two unruly prisoners there	284.85614013671875
9247/28840	Unruly Comminges smiled you wish to terrify me I	201.6910400390625
9248/28840	When he came here Monsieur DArtagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order I suppose to have his sword	66.5652084350586
9249/28840	That mood lasted some time but now hes as gentle as a lamb and sings Gascon songs which make one die of	338.47283935546875
9250/28840	Ah hes quite another sort of persona formidable gentleman	931.267333984375
9251/28840	The first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and I expected to see him leave Rueil in the same way as Samson left	72.01322174072266
9252/28840	But his temper cooled down like his friends he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about	147.60618591308594
9253/28840	Do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked Comminges who putting together what Mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the Comte de la Fere had said began to feel a degree of uneas	53.54425811767578
9254/28840	Athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by DArtagn	117.631591796875
9255/28840	Unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied They They are two hotheadsthe one a Gascon the other from Picardy both are easily excited but they quiet down	355.6096496582031
9256/28840	You have had a proof of that in what you have just related to	45.286231994628906
9257/28840	This too was the opinion of Comminges who withdrew somewhat	135.92323303222656
9258/28840	Athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinals directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a noble	115.75653839111328
9259/28840	He awaited Mazarins promised visit to get some light on his present	215.0334014892578
9260/28840	Now let us pass the orangery to the hunting	45.56037521362305
9261/28840	At the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of Ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of	119.83709716796875
9262/28840	It was in this pavilion on the ground floor that DArtagnan and Porthos were confined suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different	39.25602722167969
9263/28840	DArtagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servants	90.30828094482422
9264/28840	Porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just	103.09512329101562
9265/28840	The one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was med	108.81011962890625
9266/28840	The other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half	101.22866821289062
9267/28840	But his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes sn	97.05110168457031
9268/28840	We have been in this place nearly eightythree	122.53449249267578
9269/28840	Hem muttered Porthos with a kind of pretense of	92.8802490234375
9270/28840	Did you hear eternal sleeper cried DArtagnan irritated that any one could doze during the day when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the	62.63859176635742
9271/28840	I say we have been here eightythree	124.746826171875
9272/28840	How my fault   Yes I offered you	69.27409362792969
9273/28840	By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door  	131.2793426513672
9274/28840	Porthos men like us cant go out from here purely and	224.6720733642578
9275/28840	Faith said Porthos as for me I could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too	47.362205505371094
9276/28840	And besides he said going out of this chamber isnt	120.56082153320312
9277/28840	Dear friend said Porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor today than you were	72.933349609375
9278/28840	Explain to me why going out of this chamber isnt	218.8297882080078
9279/28840	Because having neither arms nor password we shouldnt take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sent	141.12823486328125
9280/28840	Very well said Porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his	29.101985931396484
9281/28840	Lackaday if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this	343.0542907714844
9282/28840	Ah when one thinks that for twenty years during which time I did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study Rue	46.25538635253906
9283/28840	What difference does that make said Porth	102.37041473388672
9284/28840	We shall go out all the	80.39239501953125
9285/28840	Do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands   No said Porthos but I should be glad to be	36.377681732177734
9286/28840	It is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly	266.3935546875
9287/28840	What then   Why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed	46.207176208496094
9288/28840	And what have master pastrycooks to do with us   We ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at	89.33560943603516
9289/28840	In England lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our	375.2701721191406
9290/28840	By whom then were we beaten asked Porth	90.9937515258789
9291/28840	Yes but we have drowned Monsieur Mord	24.325531005859375
9292/28840	That is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at	128.2073211669922
9293/28840	But listen Porthos though Monsieur Mordaunt was a man not to be despised Mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning	52.19185256958008
9294/28840	We must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know	176.398681640625
9295/28840	That is true said Porthos echoing DArtagnans	20.138959884643555
9296/28840	Well Porthos follow my examples walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good	125.89981079101562
9297/28840	But dont sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like	444.64459228515625
9298/28840	As to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first	133.07850646972656
9299/28840	How well you reason said Porthos admiring	95.06111907958984
9300/28840	Well yes pretty well replied DArtagnan and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us	137.17918395996094
9301/28840	Well it is impossible but that Master Aramis that keenscented bloodhound and Athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our	191.39752197265625
9302/28840	Then believe me it will be time to	48.677223205566406
9303/28840	We can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at	89.41384887695312
9304/28840	What is that   Did you observe DArtagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton   No but if it occurs a fourth time I shall complain of it so never	58.98900604248047
9305/28840	And then I feel the loss of my house tis a long time since I visited my	63.466163635253906
9306/28840	Forget them for a time we shall return to them unless Mazarin razes them to the	119.67018127441406
9307/28840	Do you think that likely   No the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk	92.88082122802734
9308/28840	Well then assume a cheerful manner as I do we must joke with the guards we must gain the goodwill of the soldiers since we cant corrupt	152.3283233642578
9309/28840	Try Porthos to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our	56.20482635498047
9310/28840	Thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is Porthos the less attractive it	100.0777587890625
9311/28840	Ah I would give much to have five hundred louis	61.13999938964844
9312/28840	So would I said Porthos unwilling to be behind DArtagnan in generosity I would give as much as a hundred pist	31.888469696044922
9313/28840	The two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when Comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and	122.10055541992188
9314/28840	I declare said Porthos I shall eat nothing if they do not take it	29.427688598632812
9315/28840	Remove the mutton cried Comminges I wish Monsieur du Vallon to sup well more especially as I have news to give him that will improve his	54.79417419433594
9316/28840	No I am sorry to tell you he is perfectly	33.075218200683594
9317/28840	News in prison is a fruit so rare that I trust Monsieur de Comminges you will excuse my impatiencethe more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is	68.4439468383789

9321/28840	A quick glance conveyed his thought to Porthos If Athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long Athos will	146.718994140625
9322/28840	Porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of Athos had suggested to him the same idea he	63.662391662597656
9323/28840	Do you say asked the Gascon timidly that the Comte de la Fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to Monsieur du Vallon and myself   Yes	17.806758880615234
9324/28840	Then you have seen him   Certainly I	16.478559494018555
9325/28840	Where if I may ask without indisc	106.94402313232422
9326/28840	Near here replied De Comminges smiling so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you	80.47062683105469
9327/28840	He is wandering about the environs of the castle thought DArtagn	34.830238342285156
9328/28840	Then he said aloud   You met him I dare say in the parkhunting perhaps   No nearer nearer	104.16394805908203
9329/28840	Look behind this wall said De Comminges knocking against the	58.127742767333984
9330/28840	Behind this wall What is there then behind this wall I was brought here by night so devil take me if I know where I	92.3919677734375
9331/28840	Suppose there were a window in this	154.49542236328125
9332/28840	Well   From that window you would see Monsieur de la Fere at	23.547338485717773
9333/28840	The count then is in the chateau  	33.59263229370117

9339/28840	One might have supposed him thunderstruck a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin but disappeared	169.80612182617188
9340/28840	Suddenly DArtagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even Porthos observed but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than	40.651710510253906
9341/28840	Come come said Comminges who since DArtagnan on the day of Broussels arrest had saved him from the hands of the Parisians had entertained a real affection for him dont be unhappy I never thought of bringing you bad	60.05874252319336
9342/28840	Laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and Monsieur du Vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about	56.40148162841797
9343/28840	But DArtagnan was still in a desponding	30.246471405029297
9344/28840	And how did he look asked Porthos who perceiving that DArtagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or	43.02333450317383
9345/28840	A great favor Zounds Monsieur the Comte de la Fere whose family is allied to the Montmorency and the Rohan is easily the equal of Monsieur de Maz	28.79176902770996
9346/28840	No matter said DArtagnan in his most wheedling	50.80003356933594
9347/28840	On reflection my dear Du Vallon it is a great honor for the Comte de la Fere and gives good reason to	26.542194366455078
9348/28840	In fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that I think Monsieur de Comminges must be	32.903377532958984
9349/28840	What I am mistaken   Monsieur de Mazarin will not come to visit the Comte de la Fere but the Comte de la Fere will be sent for to visit	10.656277656555176
9350/28840	No no no said Comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were I clearly understood what the cardinal said to	110.20481872558594
9351/28840	He will come and visit the Comte de la F	15.306206703186035
9352/28840	DArtagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether Porthos understood the importance of that visit but Porthos did not even look toward	38.55900955200195
9353/28840	It is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked DArtagn	40.569305419921875
9354/28840	Every evening he shuts himself in	508.4891662597656
9355/28840	That it seems is where he meditates on state	446.1507873535156
9356/28840	In that case said DArtagnan I begin to believe that Monsieur de la Fere will receive the visit of his eminence he will of course have an	25.332439422607422
9357/28840	And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers   The soldiers are Swiss who understand only	269.27899169921875
9358/28840	Besides according to all probability they will wait at the	49.45780944824219
9359/28840	DArtagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too	43.54130554199219
9360/28840	Let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the Comte de la Fere said DArtagnan for the count must be	21.583280563354492
9361/28840	Oh oh why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi The count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his	116.87618255615234
9362/28840	Two soldiers said DArtagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why I hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my	123.31553649902344
9363/28840	That is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for Bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes	61.807273864746094
9364/28840	Finelooking men upon my word said DArtagn	34.336463928222656
9365/28840	They belong to the regiment that was at Lens which the prince assigned to the	66.85506439208984
9366/28840	Ah monsieur said DArtagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to Monsieur de la Fere our	33.360496520996094
9367/28840	I wish it with all my heart said Comm	37.2642936706543
9368/28840	Then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it   Not at	55.90943908691406
9369/28840	This skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the Gascons	115.107421875
9370/28840	Now said DArtagnan Ive one last favor to ask of you Monsieur de Comm	23.460771560668945
9371/28840	You will see the count again   Tomorrow	61.463706970214844
9372/28840	Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained   You want the cardinal to come here   No I know my place and am not so presumpt	65.9732894897461
9373/28840	Let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all I	32.41634750366211
9374/28840	Oh muttered Porthos shaking his head never should I have thought this of him How misfortune humbles a man   I promise you it shall be done answered De Comm	78.59857940673828
9375/28840	Tell the count that I am well that you found me sad but	151.11419677734375
9376/28840	I am pleased sir to hear	82.81074523925781
9377/28840	And the same also for Monsieur du Vallon   Not for me cried Porthos I am not by any means	21.408090591430664
9378/28840	But you will be resigned my	59.01455307006836
9379/28840	Never   He will become so monsieur I know him better than he knows	29.485586166381836
9380/28840	Be silent dear Du Vallon and resign	113.15119934082031
9381/28840	Adieu gentlemen said De Comminges sleep well   We will	99.94017791748047
9382/28840	De Comminges went away DArtagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped Porthos in his arms with an expression not to be	55.39071273803711
9383/28840	Oh cried Porthos whats the matter now Have you gone mad my dear friend   What is the matter returned DArtagnan we are saved   I dont see that at all answered Porth	23.89773178100586
9384/28840	I think we are all taken prisoners except Aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in Mazarins mouset	177.0311737060547
9385/28840	Which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned DArtagn	77.00873565673828
9386/28840	Never mind lets sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the	137.4416046142578
9387/28840	What are we to do then tonight   To travel	66.33855438232422
9388/28840	But   Sit down dear friend to	121.84231567382812
9389/28840	When one is eating ideas flow	1847.4384765625
9390/28840	After supper when they are perfected I will communicate my plans to	122.30030059814453
9391/28840	So Porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by DArtagnans inventive	82.99440002441406
9392/28840	Supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of goodhumor illumined the face of DArtagn	47.45145034790039
9393/28840	Not a scintilla of these was lost on Porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his	61.197486877441406
9394/28840	At dessert DArtagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his	70.79305267333984
9395/28840	Porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at DArtagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of goodfell	38.71686553955078
9396/28840	You were saying my dear friend   No I said	23.831649780273438
9397/28840	Yes you were saying you wished to leave this	72.19696044921875
9398/28840	Ah indeed the will was never	390.5773620605469
9399/28840	To get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a	231.4210205078125
9400/28840	Tis trueI said so and I say it	181.2380828857422
9401/28840	And I answered you Porthos that it was not a good plan that we couldnt go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend	76.15827941894531
9402/28840	That is true we should need clothes and	546.4599609375
9403/28840	Well said DArtagnan rising we have them friend Porthos and even something	38.08464813232422
9404/28840	Useless to look everything will come to us when	479.1863708496094
9405/28840	At about what time did we see the two Swiss guards walking yesterday   An hour after	149.11407470703125
9406/28840	If they go out today as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour   In a quarter of an hour at	42.218505859375
9407/28840	Your arm is still strong enough is it not Porthos   Porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary	70.6462631225586
9408/28840	Yes indeed said he I believe	55.085201263427734
9409/28840	So that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew  	123.77810668945312
9410/28840	And the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his	283.15533447265625
9411/28840	I used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at Pierrefonds and I have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my	86.91598510742188
9412/28840	Because your strength is not in your head Porthos said his	63.41404342651367
9413/28840	No it is in my arms and shoulders answered Porthos with gratified naive	72.1050033569336
9414/28840	Well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron	125.75227355957031
9415/28840	Porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been	74.98008728027344
9416/28840	Well friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done	108.07666778564453
9417/28840	Shall I take out any more of them asked Porth	72.18986511230469
9418/28840	No that is sufficient a man can pass through	78.82674407958984
9419/28840	Porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body	105.31966400146484
9420/28840	Now pass your arm through this	258.0846252441406
9421/28840	Why   You will know presentlypass	64.9017105102539
9422/28840	Porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the	80.39224243164062
9423/28840	Good What shall I do now  	52.697139739990234
9424/28840	It is finished then   No not	44.361637115478516
9425/28840	I should like to understand said Porth	23.606327056884766
9426/28840	Listen my dear friend in two words you will know	61.68417739868164
9427/28840	The door of the guardhouse opens as you	76.27562713623047
9428/28840	They are about to send into our court which Monsieur de Mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend	44.10523223876953
9429/28840	If only they close the guardhouse door Good They close	962.6936645507812
9430/28840	What then   Silence They may hear	108.03910064697266
9431/28840	And yet I should have preferred   You will have the pleasure of the	39.097808837890625
9432/28840	Hush   Porthos remained silent and motion	24.75678253173828
9433/28840	In fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of	118.30976867675781
9434/28840	At this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned	40.07143020629883
9435/28840	Now said DArtagnan I am going to call this soldier and talk to	19.13870620727539
9436/28840	Dont lose a word of what Im going to say to you Porth	41.82941818237305
9437/28840	Good the execution of plots is my for	646.5999755859375
9438/28840	Look I shall turn to the left so that the soldier will be at your right as soon as he mounts on the bench to talk to	51.369346618652344
9439/28840	But supposing he doesnt mount   He will rely upon	70.71676635742188
9440/28840	As soon as you see him get up stretch out your arm and seize him by the	88.0870361328125
9441/28840	Then raising him up as Tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into the room taking care to squeeze him so tight that he cant cry	175.02659606933594
9442/28840	Suppose I happen to strangle him   To be sure there would only be a Swiss the less in the world but you will not do so I	41.09881591796875
9443/28840	Lay him down here well gag him and tie himno matter wheresomew	859.0239868164062
9444/28840	So we shall get from him one uniform and a	113.11241149902344
9445/28840	Marvelous exclaimed Porthos looking at the Gascon with the most profound	32.56627655029297
9446/28840	Yes said Porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for	72.94590759277344
9447/28840	Therefore when I cough stretch out your	256.241943359375
9448/28840	Good   The two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed Porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the	44.68142318725586
9449/28840	Goodevening comrade said DArtagnan in his most fascinating voice and	66.05992126464844
9450/28840	Goodevening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial	204.39971923828125
9451/28840	Tis not too warm to walk resumed DArtagn	58.80152130126953
9452/28840	And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you   A glass of wine will be extremely	34.942989349365234
9453/28840	The fish bitesthe fish bites whispered the Gascon to Porth	162.83799743652344
9454/28840	A bottle perhaps   A whole bottle Yes	240.8616943359375
9455/28840	A whole bottle if you will drink my	235.88818359375
9456/28840	Come then and take it friend said the Gas	71.23311614990234
9457/28840	How convenient that theres a bench	672.01171875
9458/28840	Egad one would think it had been placed here on	133.2645721435547
9459/28840	That instant the arm of Porthos	57.39921951293945
9460/28840	His hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmiths pincers the soldiers	240.26051330566406
9461/28840	He raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the	69.23370361328125
9462/28840	Then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two	106.65975189208984
9463/28840	Heres a sword and a dress said Porth	66.67817687988281
9464/28840	I take them said DArtagnan for	25.329057693481445
9465/28840	If you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over	319.3550720214844
9466/28840	Stop I see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward	109.19942474365234
9467/28840	I think replied Porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruin	56.849945068359375
9468/28840	No I will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready g	91.15764617919922
9469/28840	Be ready said Porthos as he slipped through the	42.57638931274414
9470/28840	Porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after	110.32954406738281
9471/28840	Then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bedthe bedstead being of	130.36093139648438
9472/28840	This operation proved as great a success as the	494.002197265625
9473/28840	There said DArtagnan this is capital Now let me try on the dress of yonder	47.02921676635742
9474/28840	Porthos I doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red	78.74555969238281
9475/28840	It happened however that the second soldier was a Swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted Porthos	206.56536865234375
9476/28840	Tis done they both exclaimed at	492.5950622558594
9477/28840	As to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead	101.95915222167969
9478/28840	The soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of Porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against	101.3711166381836
9479/28840	Now said DArtagnan you wouldnt be sorry to understand the plot would you Porthos   Well no not	29.288101196289062
9480/28840	Well then we shall go down into the	35.85581970214844
9481/28840	We shall take the place of those two	91.22130584716797
9482/28840	Well   We will walk back and	92.09542083740234
9483/28840	Thats a good idea for it isnt	160.15870666503906
9484/28840	In a moment the valetdechambre will call the guard as he did yesterday and the day	33.01893997192383
9485/28840	And we shall answer   No on the contrary we shall not	35.926109313964844
9486/28840	As you please I dont insist on	224.58905029296875
9487/28840	We will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his em	103.9007339477539
9488/28840	Where shall we escort him   Where he is goingto visit Ath	79.11840057373047
9489/28840	Do you think Athos will be sorry to see us   Oh cried Porthos oh I	29.425899505615234
9490/28840	Wait a little Porthos before crying out for on my word you havent reached the end said the Gascon in a jesting	62.46860122680664
9491/28840	The man who lives to see shall	159.48736572265625
9492/28840	And slipping through the aperture he alighted in the	61.06346130371094
9493/28840	Porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less	76.49905395507812
9494/28840	They could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the	115.74064636230469
9495/28840	Where are you asked the valetdechambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the	55.95824432373047
9496/28840	What say you to that Monsieur du Vallon he added in a low tone to Porth	14.346138000488281
9497/28840	If it but lasts most capital responded Porth	250.09934997558594
9498/28840	Do you hearnot a single creature Obey that person	419.7995300292969
9499/28840	On your return you cannot make a	153.38204956054688
9500/28840	You have only to wait here till I release	135.80630493164062
9501/28840	DArtagnan was known to this valetdechambre who was no other than Bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the Gascon a dozen times to the	27.407228469848633
9502/28840	The Gascon therefore instead of answering growled out Ja Ja in the most German and the least Gascon accent	176.61767578125
9503/28840	As for Porthos on whom DArtagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow Mazarin in his visit to Athos he was simply	57.99545669555664
9504/28840	All that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial Der Teufel   Bernouin shut the door and went	66.32811737060547
9505/28840	When Porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for	91.22970581054688
9506/28840	Porthos my friend said DArtagnan dont distrust Providence Let me meditate and	65.41410827636719
9507/28840	Meditate and consider as much as you like replied Porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this	98.10478973388672
9508/28840	We have walked eight paces whispered DArtagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orang	83.32173919677734
9509/28840	The Comte de la Fere cannot be far off only the doors are	43.95313262939453
9510/28840	That is a slight difficulty said Porthos and a good push with the shoulders   For Gods sake Porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they	89.7191390991211
9511/28840	Have you not heard that some one is coming here  	49.2658576965332
9512/28840	Well that some one will open the	94.48579406738281
9513/28840	But my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost for you dont propose I imagine that I shall kill that man of the	84.524169921875
9514/28840	That might do if we were dealing with Englishmen or	283.9687805175781
9515/28840	Oh may God keep me from it and you too said DArtagn	33.602203369140625
9516/28840	The young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to	96.6915054321289
9517/28840	And then besides the useless blood never no never I have my plan let me carry it out and we shall	289.7623596191406
9518/28840	So much the better said Porthos I feel some need of	36.64842987060547
9519/28840	Hush said DArtagnan the some one is	47.9417839050293
9520/28840	The sound of a light step was heard in the vestib	61.94656753540039
9521/28840	The hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his	61.62884521484375
9522/28840	Porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern   Light the lamp which hangs from the	64.93433380126953
9523/28840	Then addressing DArtagnan   You know the watchword he	19.744205474853516
9524/28840	Ja replied the Gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the German	97.39017486572266
9525/28840	And advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he	77.52169036865234
9526/28840	Now asked Porthos what are we to do   Now we shall make use of your shoulder friend Porthos if this door proves to be	43.660194396972656
9527/28840	Everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait	153.02386474609375
9528/28840	But first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder caval	164.5478515625
9529/28840	The two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open	125.96454620361328
9530/28840	There said DArtagnan we cant be overt	23.238800048828125
9531/28840	The bolt gave way and the door	162.11715698242188
9532/28840	As I told you everything can be attained Porthos women and doors by proceeding with gent	113.62467193603516
9533/28840	Youre a great moralist and thats the fact said Porth	102.03482818603516
9534/28840	Ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it	142.67384338378906
9535/28840	DArtagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding	61.749271392822266
9536/28840	He called Porthos to look at	34.83183670043945
9537/28840	Were our object money only he said we should be rich	367.669921875
9538/28840	It would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said Porth	47.51858901977539
9539/28840	So I think and therefore I said Were our object money only but we want something else replied the Gas	92.45331573486328
9540/28840	At the same moment whilst DArtagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the	78.64866638183594
9541/28840	Mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong	131.00357055664062
9542/28840	Faith he said in Italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith theres enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in	166.33909606933594
9543/28840	I am a great captainthat I am but I make war in my own	59.08322525024414
9544/28840	The two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side	291.66790771484375
9545/28840	Mazarin came within three steps of DArtagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its	155.83616638183594
9546/28840	Then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern Now he said for Monsieur de la F	35.233402252197266
9547/28840	Very good thought DArtagnan tis our road likewise we will go	60.935447692871094
9548/28840	All three set off on their walk Mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side	213.5830078125
9549/28840	The cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of	122.09973907470703
9550/28840	He then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in	54.018028259277344
9551/28840	Ah Diavolo he exclaimed I forgot the recommendation of De Comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that fourheaded combination of	86.91938781738281
9552/28840	And with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his	55.681190490722656
9553/28840	Do not give yourself the trouble my lord said DArtagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we	60.86357498168945
9554/28840	And he made the same friendly salute as DArtagn	42.526859283447266
9555/28840	Mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of	161.97830200195312
9556/28840	DArtagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been	47.1707649230957
9557/28840	Oh what imprudence my lord said DArtagnan tis not good to be about just here without a	37.01069641113281
9558/28840	Your eminence might knock against something or fall into a	135.21963500976562
9559/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan muttered Mazarin unable to recover from his aston	21.193599700927734
9560/28840	I have the honor to present to you Monsieur du Vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself	42.732994079589844
9561/28840	And DArtagnan held the lamp before the merry face of Porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole	49.919044494628906
9562/28840	You were going to visit Monsieur de la Fere said DArtagn	7.157014846801758
9563/28840	Be so good as to show us the way and we will follow	32.341453552246094
9564/28840	Mazarin was by degrees recovering his	1848.0703125
9565/28840	Have you been long in the orangery he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his	85.37387084960938
9566/28840	Porthos opened his mouth to reply DArtagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually	74.5110855102539
9567/28840	This moment come my lord said DArtagn	28.75674057006836
9568/28840	His fears were now no longer for his hoard but for	130.74427795410156
9569/28840	A sort of smile played on his	135.4346466064453
9570/28840	Come he said you have me in a snare	67.84165954589844
9571/28840	You wish to ask for liberty andI give it	98.98938751220703
9572/28840	Oh my lord answered DArtagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we want to ask something else of	32.564842224121094
9573/28840	You have your liberty repeated Mazarin in	220.09677124023438
9574/28840	Certainly and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back	66.14199829101562
9575/28840	Mazarin felt a shiver run through hima chill even to his hearts	680.3223876953125
9576/28840	His piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the Gascon and the unchanging countenance of Porth	59.9583854675293
9577/28840	Both were in shadow and the Sybil of Cuma herself could not have read	98.10011291503906
9578/28840	To purchase back my liberty said the	221.3621063232422
9579/28840	And how much will that cost me Monsieur dArtagnan   Zounds my lord I dont know	20.105093002319336
9580/28840	We must ask the Comte de la Fere the	18.673219680786133
9581/28840	Will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the counts room and in ten minutes all will be	39.57501983642578
9582/28840	Be assured answered Mazarin that I shall attempt nothing I give you my word of	57.5792121887207
9583/28840	DArtagnan made a sign to Porthos to redouble his watchfulness then turning to Mazarin   Now my lord let us enter if you	23.681241989135742
9584/28840	Mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found Athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice Comminges had given	124.95442199707031
9585/28840	Your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of	70.60265350341797
9586/28840	And so my dear count said DArtagnan his eminence didnt actually insist on our attending him it is Du Vallon and I who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see	76.4559097290039
9587/28840	At that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone Athos made a bound of	272.8343505859375
9588/28840	Ah my lord cried the Gascon dont threaten tis a bad	80.78423309326172
9589/28840	We are so good and gentle to your em	53.070247650146484
9590/28840	Come let us put aside all rancor and talk	229.4880828857422
9591/28840	Theres nothing I wish more replied Maz	267.0245056152344
9592/28840	But dont think yourselves in a better position than you	101.79102325439453
9593/28840	In ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap	389.7123107910156
9594/28840	How are you to get away from here remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these	120.49415588378906
9595/28840	Now I am going to show you how sincere I	31.672964096069336
9596/28840	Good thought DArtagnan we must look about us hes going to play us a	102.4248046875
9597/28840	I offered you your liberty continued the minister will you take it Before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like	175.08419799804688
9598/28840	And like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his	275.14208984375
9599/28840	And therefore said DArtagnan to clip the hope which Athoss tacit adhesion had imparted to Mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extrem	66.53722381591797
9600/28840	If on the contrary resumed Mazarin you accept your liberty   Why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you I believe you will so take it away from	42.702884674072266
9601/28840	You do not believe me   My lord I never believe cardinals who are not	56.61111068725586
9602/28840	Well on the faith of a	106.14427947998047
9603/28840	You are no longer a minister my lord you are a	50.18532180786133
9604/28840	Then on the honor of a Mazarin as I am and ever shall be I hope said the	37.34511947631836
9605/28840	I have heard speak of a Mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in	118.92186737060547
9606/28840	I fear he may have been an ancestor of your em	38.2666130065918
9607/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan you are a great wit and I am really sorry to be on bad terms with	19.605518341064453
9608/28840	My lord let us come to terms I ask nothing	145.7748565673828
9609/28840	Very well said Mazarin if I place you in security in a manner evident palpable   Ah that is another thing said Porth	43.482181549072266
9610/28840	In the first place do you accept asked the	69.84199523925781
9611/28840	Unfold your plan my lord and we will	79.73072052001953
9612/28840	Take notice that you are shut upcapt	208.2819061279297
9613/28840	You well know my lord that there always remains to us a last	111.07579040527344
9614/28840	What   That of dying	175.7720489501953
9615/28840	Listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which I have the key it leads into the	61.272621154785156
9616/28840	Go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have	137.435791015625
9617/28840	At a hundred steps on turning to the left you will find the wall of the park get over it and in three leaps you will be on the road and	57.37795639038086
9618/28840	Ah by Jove my lord said DArtagnan you have well said but these are only	33.895225524902344
9619/28840	Where is the key you speak of   Here it	49.164093017578125
9620/28840	Ah my lord You will conduct us yourself then to that door   Very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and Mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the	65.49085235595703
9621/28840	It led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their	88.81055450439453
9622/28840	The devil exclaimed the Gascon tis a dreadful night my	100.7024154663086
9623/28840	We dont know the locality and shall never find the	105.9494400024414
9624/28840	Since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further conduct us my lord to the	104.55667114257812
9625/28840	Be it so replied the cardinal and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same	53.29062271118164
9626/28840	I think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were	45.23395919799805
9627/28840	Deuce take it three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church Ah apropos my lord you remarked that we were all active vigorous and	190.6519775390625
9628/28840	Monsieur du Vallon and I are the only two who are	32.82355499267578
9629/28840	The count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend	136.9842071533203
9630/28840	Where can we find another sword asked Porth	78.13536834716797
9631/28840	My lord said DArtagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the Comte de la F	23.291500091552734
9632/28840	Willingly said the cardinal I will even ask the count to keep it for my	89.0394058227539
9633/28840	I promise you my lord never to part with it replied Ath	84.62725067138672
9634/28840	Well well cried DArtagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes Porthos   Yes said Porthos but I do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep I think it is the	33.44786071777344
9635/28840	Now climb up Athos quickly said DArtagn	38.98727798461914
9636/28840	Athos assisted by Porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the	89.3278579711914
9637/28840	Athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the	74.1969223022461
9638/28840	Are you on the ground asked DArtagn	17.49558448791504
9639/28840	Without accident   Perfectly safe and	109.58861541748047
9640/28840	Porthos whilst I get up watch the	185.78575134277344
9641/28840	No I dont want your help watch the	199.942138671875
9642/28840	Well   You are right it is more difficult than I	18.072772979736328
9643/28840	Lend me your backbut dont let the cardinal	350.3000183105469
9644/28840	Porthos lent him his back and DArtagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated	24.440126419067383
9645/28840	Yes my friend and now   Now what asked Porth	28.23336410522461
9646/28840	Now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle	232.12094116210938
9647/28840	You are free he said through me your liberty was my	209.93760681152344
9648/28840	Porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friends hand gained the	134.701904296875
9649/28840	I didnt understand it all he said but I understand now how droll it is   You think so so much the better but that it may prove laughterworthy even to the end let us not lose	58.80738067626953
9650/28840	Attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said DArtagnan for myself I will reconnoit	38.11250686645508
9651/28840	The Gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant	225.04733276367188
9652/28840	My lord he said which way do we go Think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of	193.4242401123047
9653/28840	Along the wall sir said Mazarin there will be no danger of losing	76.41876983642578
9654/28840	The three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the	108.79657745361328
9655/28840	The cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do	122.17725372314453
9656/28840	Suddenly DArtagnan touched something warm which	93.78761291503906
9657/28840	Stop a horse he cried I have found a horse   And I likewise said Ath	51.67539596557617
9658/28840	I too said Porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinals	69.61559295654297
9659/28840	Theres luck my lord just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to	218.819580078125
9660/28840	Is Aramis here   Yes sir he has been here since	24.270465850830078
9661/28840	What are you doing   On the watch   What Aramis here cried Ath	32.44287109375
9662/28840	At the lesser gate of the castle hes posted	289.7054443359375
9663/28840	Are you a large party   S	93.76373291015625
9664/28840	And believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself Grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his	143.8926544189453
9665/28840	There was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal Maz	63.966896057128906
9666/28840	Thinking that Porthos will be at last a Baron and DArtagnan a	61.215118408203125
9667/28840	At the expiration of ten minutes Aramis arrived accompanied by Grimaud and eight or ten	88.8024673461914
9668/28840	He was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends	85.48186492919922
9669/28840	You are free my brothers free without my aid and I shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my	78.09864044189453
9670/28840	Do not be unhappy dear friend on that account if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied Ath	68.45758819580078
9671/28840	I had well concerted my plans pursued Aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from Rueil to Saint Germain twenty are dispersed in the	144.9434356689453
9672/28840	Thus I was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from Mazarin to the	95.18695831298828
9673/28840	In the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to Melun since Rueil seemed to him not sufficiently	155.43304443359375
9674/28840	You can understand dear friend with what hope I was inspired by that last	203.7657012939453
9675/28840	I placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men I encircled the castle the riding horses I entrusted to Grimaud and I awaited your coming out which I did not expect till tomorrow and I didnt hope to free you without a skirm	102.13739776611328
9676/28840	You are free tonight without fighting so much the better How did you manage to escape that scoundrel Mazarin You must have much reason to complain of	63.68373489379883
9677/28840	Really   I might even say that we have some reason to praise	45.331687927246094
9678/28840	Impossible   Yes really it is owing to him that we are	70.89952850341797
9679/28840	Owing to him   Yes he had us conducted into the orangery by Monsieur Bernouin his valetdechambre and from there we followed him to visit the Comte de la F	22.618431091308594
9680/28840	Then he offered us our liberty and we accepted	139.497802734375
9681/28840	He even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with Grim	124.80436706542969
9682/28840	Well exclaimed Aramis this will reconcile me to him but I wish he were here that I might tell him that I did not believe him capable of so noble an	54.839839935302734
9683/28840	My lord said DArtagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the Chevalier dHerblay who wishesas you may have heardto offer his congratulations to your em	36.88506317138672
9684/28840	And he retired discovering Mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of Aram	93.9726333618164
9685/28840	Ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize Halloo halloo friends to horse to horse   Several horsemen ran quickly to	206.30630493164062
9686/28840	I think it will be wise to set off said DArtagn	17.445266723632812
9687/28840	Yes but I am expecting some one a friend of Ath	48.30047607421875
9688/28840	And here he comes by Jupiter galloping through the	171.73822021484375
9689/28840	The count the count cried a young voice that made Athos	150.78433227539062
9690/28840	For one moment the young man forgot his habitual respecthe threw himself on his fathers	107.67405700683594
9691/28840	He will indeed give us the favor of his company you will I hope be grateful for it Porthos do not lose sight of his em	53.36692810058594
9692/28840	Aramis then joined Athos and DArtagnan who were consulting	49.15027618408203
9693/28840	Come said DArtagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our	35.17829895019531
9694/28840	Where are we to go asked Porth	29.87969398498535
9695/28840	Come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you	48.03089904785156
9696/28840	The chances of war said Athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of	117.39803314208984
9697/28840	No but we shall make use of them said DArtagn	13.696722030639648
9698/28840	The rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former	63.09859848022461
9699/28840	Mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phant	216.1685791015625
9700/28840	At dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell	365.876220703125
9701/28840	Horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed Porthos everything degener	281.4546203613281
9702/28840	I have sent Grimaud to Dammartin said Aram	38.47490692138672
9703/28840	He is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for	140.1016845703125
9704/28840	We at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us	87.70580291748047
9705/28840	Once beyond Saint Denis we shall have nothing to	136.6456756591797
9706/28840	Grimaud in fact brought back five	662.0404052734375
9707/28840	The nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of Porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend	75.9407730102539
9708/28840	Ten minutes later the escort stopped at Ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding Mazarin	248.87637329101562
9709/28840	At noon they rode into the avenue of Pierref	85.71578216552734
9710/28840	We are four of us said DArtagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a	75.86168670654297
9711/28840	Athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege Porthos will see to the provisions and Aramis to the troops of the	64.7630844116211
9712/28840	That is to say Athos will be chief engineer Porthos purveyoringeneral and Aramis governor of the	82.4043960571289
9713/28840	Meanwhile they gave up to Mazarin the handsomest room in the chate	79.97750091552734
9714/28840	Gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect I presume to keep me here a long time incognito   No my lord replied the Gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you	44.29182434082031
9715/28840	And what shall you do   Defend	130.93630981445312
9716/28840	Were the late Cardinal Richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the Bastion Saint Gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole	112.65326690673828
9717/28840	Such feats sir are done onceand never	3476.2666015625
9718/28840	However nowadays theres no need of so much	123.99266052246094
9719/28840	Tomorrow the army of Paris will be summoned the day after it will be here The field of battle instead therefore of being at Saint Denis or at Charenton will be near Compiegne or VillarsCottere	46.20995330810547
9720/28840	The prince will vanquish you as he has always	298.175537109375
9721/28840	Tis possible my lord but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend Du Vallon who has	97.20598602294922
9722/28840	We will not expose your eminence to the chances of	59.8111572265625
9723/28840	Come answered Mazarin I see it will be necessary for me to capit	37.001216888427734
9724/28840	Before a siege   Yes the conditions will be better than	80.8065414428711
9725/28840	Ah my lord as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are   Come now what are your conditions   Rest yourself first my lord and wewe will	89.08526611328125
9726/28840	I do not need rest gentlemen I need to know whether I am among enemies or	116.61136627197266
9727/28840	Friends my lord friends   Well then tell me at once what you want that I may see if any arrangement be	47.77442932128906
9728/28840	Speak Comte de la Fere   My lord replied Athos for myself I have nothing to	20.633628845214844
9729/28840	For France were I to specify my wishes I should have too	110.35610961914062
9730/28840	I beg you to excuse me and propose to the cheval	27.571666717529297
9731/28840	And Athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the	93.99002075195312
9732/28840	What do you want Nothing ambiguous if you	49.57198715209961
9733/28840	As for me replied Aramis I have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputationof which I formed onewent yesterday to Saint Germain to impose on	73.80154418945312
9734/28840	Let us consider first the ancient	973.32373046875
9735/28840	The demands in that programme must be	408.1739807128906
9736/28840	We were almost agreed on those replied Mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stip	195.45750427246094
9737/28840	You suppose then that there are some said Aramis	146.28546142578125
9738/28840	I do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as Monsieur de la Fere replied the cardinal bowing to Ath	24.76327133178711
9739/28840	My lord you are right and I am glad to see that you do justice to the count at	29.578628540039062
9740/28840	The count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly	391.6936340332031
9741/28840	He is a proud soulhe is a man by himself You are righthe is worth us all and we avow it to you   Aramis said Athos are you jesting   No no dear friend I state only what we all	68.83598327636719
9742/28840	You are right it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unworthy servant	129.45079040527344
9743/28840	Well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited   I require my lord that Normandy should be given to Madame de Longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full abs	47.72940444946289
9744/28840	I require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our Holy Father the	79.39878845214844
9745/28840	That is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit France and be an	160.9657440185547
9746/28840	I wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my	110.13983154296875
9747/28840	Mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to DArtagn	46.08207702636719
9748/28840	I my lord answered the Gascon I differ from Monsieur dHerblay entirely as to the last point though I agree with him on the	33.96157455444336
9749/28840	Far from wishing my lord to quit Paris I hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great states	78.16197204589844
9750/28840	I shall try also to help him to down the Fronde but on one conditionthat he sometimes remembers the kings faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that I could	103.73217010498047
9751/28840	And you Monsieur du Vallon   Yes you sir Speak if you please said Maz	14.442904472351074
9752/28840	You know sir that before receiving the order one must submit	446.8291320800781
9753/28840	Besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be	75.0951919555664
9754/28840	Mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly   All this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if I satisfy some I shall displease	228.9039306640625
9755/28840	True said Aramis so as I am in a minority I withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to Rome and monseigneurs	107.15229034423828
9756/28840	I am to remain minister then said Maz	47.2151985168457
9757/28840	You remain minister that is understood said DArtagnan France needs	130.0460205078125
9758/28840	And I desist from my pretensions said Aram	198.039306640625
9759/28840	His eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majestys favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for France and for	66.23428344726562
9760/28840	Occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let France settle matters as she will with me resumed Maz	214.5417022705078
9761/28840	The Frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queens consent to	74.3709487915039
9762/28840	I can answer only for myself said Maz	56.55671691894531
9763/28840	Suppose her majesty refuses   Oh said DArtagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him	42.824520111083984
9764/28840	Here monseigneur said Aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of Fronde	27.604494094848633
9765/28840	Will your eminence please read and examine   I am acquainted with	67.04469299316406
9766/28840	Reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by	338.2051696777344
9767/28840	Monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely	122.46141815185547
9768/28840	Suppose I refuse   Then said DArtagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a	40.508094787597656
9769/28840	Would you dare to touch a cardinal   You have dared my lord to imprison her majestys musket	35.392940521240234
9770/28840	I do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to Paris and the Parisians will defend	45.95524597167969
9771/28840	How uneasy they must be at this moment at Rueil and Saint Germain said Aram	31.35844612121582
9772/28840	Sign the treaty then monseigneur said Aram	21.912105560302734
9773/28840	Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it   Ah nonsense cried DArtagnan I can manage so that her majesty will receive me well I know an excellent	45.352596282958984
9774/28840	What   I shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are	58.4509391784668
9775/28840	When I see her majesty embarrassed I shall conduct her to Rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a	142.76947021484375
9776/28840	Enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty   Here it is replied Aram	43.1407470703125
9777/28840	Sign my lord and he gave him a	40.228736877441406
9778/28840	Mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not de	1626.256103515625
9779/28840	And when I have signed he said what is to be my guarantee   My word of honor sir said Ath	39.505096435546875
9780/28840	Mazarin started turned toward the Comte de la Fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the	69.78752136230469
9781/28840	It is sufficient count he said and signed the	210.62686157226562
9782/28840	And now Monsieur dArtagnan he said prepare to set off for Saint Germain and take a letter from me to the	21.077404022216797
9783/28840	Shows how with Threat and Pen more is effected than by the	502.7663879394531
9784/28840	DArtagnan knew his part well he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing	77.03385162353516
9785/28840	He soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to Chantilly so that he might be in Paris in five or six	121.76036834716797
9786/28840	But before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind	142.36322021484375
9787/28840	In fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission Athos for generosity is a hero of romance Porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced Aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illeg	110.30670928955078
9788/28840	What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them The deliverance of the cardinal	78.97592163085938
9789/28840	Now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of Hercules were pyg	109.02201080322266
9790/28840	You my dear Chevalier dHerblay he said are the Fronde incarn	21.73305892944336
9791/28840	Mistrust Athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his	160.88885498046875
9792/28840	Mistrust Porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as God on earth will assist him in contriving Mazarins escape if Mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chival	162.79397583007812
9793/28840	Aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and res	137.86090087890625
9794/28840	Fear nothing he said I have my conditions to	133.75119018554688

9796/28840	Good thought DArtagnan in this direction I am	25.782764434814453
9797/28840	He pressed Aramiss hand and went in search of Porth	45.37669372558594
9798/28840	What should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let Mazarin go   Why I should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so	64.53463745117188
9799/28840	Bravo Porthos and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this Mazarin would have you	80.09248352050781
9800/28840	Do you think so   I am sure of	12.665316581726074
9801/28840	Then I would kill him rather than let him	77.98989868164062
9802/28840	There is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of securing those of the Frondeurs who besides dont understand political matters as we old soldiers	179.20252990722656
9803/28840	I shall see you through the window as you mount your horse I shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight then I shall place myself at the cardinals doora door with glass	66.16899871826172
9804/28840	I shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign I shall begin to extermin	136.2250213623047
9805/28840	Bravo thought DArtagnan on this side I think the cardinal will be well	61.560791015625
9806/28840	He pressed the hand of the lord of Pierrefonds and went in search of Ath	37.472171783447266
9807/28840	My dear Athos he said I am going	29.899213790893555
9808/28840	I have only one thing to say to	14.377629280090332

9811/28840	I give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave	37.505313873291016
9812/28840	This reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought DArtagn	51.98492431640625

9814/28840	DArtagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from Mazarin to secure his admission to the queens	49.74982833862305
9815/28840	Six hours after he left Pierrefonds he was at Saint Germ	42.50588607788086
9816/28840	The disappearance of Mazarin was not as yet generally	168.87510681152344
9817/28840	Anne of Austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every	59.55394744873047
9818/28840	In the chamber of DArtagnan and Porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and g	24.62773323059082
9819/28840	On recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knewthat they had been seized stripped and	159.3189239501953
9820/28840	But as to what had been done by Porthos and DArtagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chate	24.306884765625
9821/28840	Bernouin alone knew a little more than the	105.77442932128906
9822/28840	Bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orang	81.18550109863281
9823/28840	The first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that	243.77040100097656
9824/28840	Then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of Athoss chamber and that of the	66.87454986572266
9825/28840	From the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the	132.2229461669922
9826/28840	He saw that these tracks tended toward the wall on the other side he found similar tracks then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of Engh	79.22618103027344
9827/28840	He could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time and he had hastened to Saint Germain to warn the queen of that	41.28168487548828
9828/28840	Now since DArtagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from Rueil and was going to Saint Germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any	39.54293441772461
9829/28840	On entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was Maitre Bernouin in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished	128.5331573486328
9830/28840	At the sight of DArtagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback Bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be	26.234512329101562
9831/28840	But DArtagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his	21.77777862548828
9832/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan cried the latter like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep Monsieur dArtagnan   Himself Monsieur Bernou	15.145285606384277
9833/28840	And why have you come here   To bring news of Monsieur de Mazarinthe freshest news there	45.84687042236328
9834/28840	What has become of him then   He is as well as you and	19.901472091674805
9835/28840	Nothing bad has happened to him then   Absolutely	96.90595245361328
9836/28840	He felt the need of making a trip in the Ile de France and begged usthe Comte de la Fere and Monsieur du Vallonto accompany	55.77336883544922
9837/28840	We were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that	205.88204956054688
9838/28840	We set out last evening and here we	140.04437255859375
9839/28840	His eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and privatea mission that could be confided only to a sure manand so has sent me to Saint Germ	106.49560546875
9840/28840	And therefore my dear Monsieur Bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that I have come and tell her with what	37.50145721435547
9841/28840	DArtagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinals letter   It was however merely a letter of	55.37998962402344
9842/28840	The queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for	160.0520477294922
9843/28840	DArtagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on	128.34947204589844
9844/28840	The queen as he went on looked at him with increasing aston	65.42902374267578
9845/28840	She could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish	112.41604614257812
9846/28840	There is here no question of crime or	242.7370147705078
9847/28840	Monsieur de Mazarin held us in prison Monsieur du Vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to England to quietly look on while they cut off the head of Charles	52.422245025634766
9848/28840	brotherinlaw of the late king your husband the consort of Madame Henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal	103.03585052490234
9849/28840	We were then convinced my friend and I that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and	74.10972595214844
9850/28840	Now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and	195.2532196044922
9851/28840	We have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friends chateau and there we have come to an	39.76973342895508
9852/28840	Well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a	74.42646026611328
9853/28840	We were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the Louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a	107.51583099365234
9854/28840	That proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully	162.59327697753906
9855/28840	I listen to you and I wonder at you sir said the	34.64573669433594
9856/28840	In fact I have rarely seen such excess of imp	431.4125061035156
9857/28840	Your majesty on your side said DArtagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the Cardinal Mazarin has always	39.609188079833984
9858/28840	You are in error sir answered the	56.14942932128906
9859/28840	I am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour I shall set off at the head of my army to release my	51.409767150878906
9860/28840	I am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous	59.906917572021484
9861/28840	Before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should I find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all I could to induce you to change your	102.8897933959961
9862/28840	Well then I will content myself with arresting you   Madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should I not have returned by tomorrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to Paris and delivered to the	61.89861297607422
9863/28840	Your pardon madame I know all	42.57133483886719
9864/28840	And therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to De Beaufort nor to De Bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to DElbe	51.518516540527344
9865/28840	These gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good	97.10317993164062
9866/28840	He will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even Monsieur de Mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole	61.07636260986328
9867/28840	I think returned Anne of Austria fixing upon him a glance which in any womans face would have expressed disdain but in a queens spread terror to those she looked upon nay I perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your	141.9039764404297
9868/28840	Madame replied DArtagnan I threaten simply and solely because I am obliged to do	36.09016799926758
9869/28840	What am I A poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which I have sought so long rests on me for a	164.68600463867188
9870/28840	Look at the Comte de la Fere a type of nobility a flower of ch	28.421640396118164
9871/28840	He has taken part against his queen or rather against her	208.27574157714844
9872/28840	He has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to	79.61803436279297
9873/28840	Look at Monsieur du Vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in	85.3095703125
9874/28840	Why did you not say all this before you took action sir she	129.45281982421875
9875/28840	Because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubtedthat is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your	102.9801025390625
9876/28840	And that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what I	152.69418334960938
9877/28840	I ought muttered Anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are	149.72451782226562
9878/28840	Alas madame exclaimed DArtagnan this proves to me that not till today has your majesty had a just idea of	78.56017303466797
9879/28840	Perhaps said Anne but that idea if at last I have it   Your majesty will do us	73.47958374023438
9880/28840	In doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar	145.6788787841797
9881/28840	You will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his	148.70359802246094
9882/28840	Where is the treaty   Here it	38.119606018066406
9883/28840	Anne of Austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that DArtagnan presented to	58.38826370239258
9884/28840	We do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great	249.92303466796875
9885/28840	It is my intention so to do come let us hear	102.4015121459961
9886/28840	Tis the appointment Monsieur de Tréville held you ask of	42.7911262512207
9887/28840	The place madame is vacant and although tis a year since Monsieur de Tréville has left it it has not been	60.0892448425293
9888/28840	But it is one of the principal military appointments in the kings	67.42723846435547
9889/28840	Monsieur de Tréville was but a younger son of a simple Gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty	69.5332260131836
9890/28840	You have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and	102.90381622314453
9891/28840	Undoubtedly madame said DArtagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office	73.96800994873047
9892/28840	What more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her	66.46057891845703
9893/28840	A hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your	52.343727111816406
9894/28840	Nay it must have been a	76.39851379394531
9895/28840	A country clown said Anne of Austria people will	190.26182556152344

9897/28840	said the queen she signed a	207.30455017089844
9898/28840	Now there remains the chevalier or the Abbé dHerblay as your majesty ple	16.106801986694336
9899/28840	Does he wish to be a bishop   No madame something easier to	56.62649917602539
9900/28840	What   It is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of Madame de Longue	17.046674728393555
9901/28840	Monsieur de Longueville is of royal blood madame said DArtagn	21.690725326538086
9902/28840	Yes said the queen but his son   His son madame must be since the husband of the sons mother	65.28055572509766
9903/28840	And your friend has nothing more to ask for Madame de Longueville   No madame for I presume that the king standing godfather to him could do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs giving his father also the government of	38.560577392578125
9904/28840	As to the government of Normandy replied the queen I think I can promise but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal	49.13279342651367
9905/28840	We shall search for some madame and I think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some	78.27088165283203

9908/28840	What does he ask  	45.652713775634766
9909/28840	There is in the world then one man who having the power to ask asksnothing   There is the Comte de la Fere mad	34.178627014160156
9910/28840	The Comte de la Fere is not a	7.951900959014893
9911/28840	What is he then   The Comte de la Fere is a demig	13.228020668029785
9912/28840	If that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say   Perhaps he would	88.00890350341797
9913/28840	Perhaps   Yes if your majesty herself should beg him to	73.69998168945312
9914/28840	He must be indeed a strange	112.76264190673828
9915/28840	Well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg	137.5375213623047
9916/28840	Are you satisfied sir   There is one thing the queen has not signedher assent to the	71.52494049072266
9917/28840	Of what use today I will sign it	502.313720703125
9918/28840	I can assure her majesty that if she does not sign today she will not have time to sign	74.62899780273438
9919/28840	Consent then I beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by Mazarin as you see   I consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the Paris	40.99460220336914
9920/28840	Anne was caught she could not draw backshe signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to	211.84524536132812
9921/28840	Since that period of history queens have shed tears like other	1199.7484130859375

9928/28840	And DArtagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in Annes hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much	134.22071838378906

9931/28840	He was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be	132.78970336914062
9932/28840	There are the acts signed I deliver them to you without	239.43020629882812

9939/28840	In twentyfour hours DArtagnan and Porthos conducted Mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of	39.16555404663086

9941/28840	Here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty   Monsieur de Conti received Damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made	114.548828125
9942/28840	Moreover something had been said of a marriage with Mazarins	67.8929214477539

10019/28840	During twenty he had been lieutenant their captain since the night	258.9578552246094
10020/28840	The cortege proceeded to Notre Dame where a Te Deum was	227.74356079101562
10021/28840	The Swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep	112.12727355957031
10022/28840	This force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with	134.94395446777344
10023/28840	Whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen Anne looked at DArtagnan anx	67.44711303710938
10024/28840	At the Palais Royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the Rue Saint Hon	70.08057403564453

10029/28840	Anne of Austria bent down and whispered in the young kings ear   Say something gracious to Monsieur dArtagnan my	47.866756439208984
10030/28840	The young king leaned toward the	172.8867950439453
10031/28840	I have not said goodmorning to you Monsieur dArtagnan he said nevertheless I have remarked	19.64297103881836

10034/28840	Sir said Mazarin to Porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us   Kill as many as I could my	37.53955841064453
10035/28840	Hem brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them	106.60773468017578
10036/28840	Tis true answered Porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are a lot of	55.89949417114258
10037/28840	I think I should like the other fellow better than this one said Mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his	45.41107940673828
10038/28840	The queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel	304.644287109375
10039/28840	The crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be	168.91497802734375
10040/28840	Reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming stormand when they pass athwart a multitude presage an eme	324.22088623046875
10041/28840	DArtagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the	50.81276321411133
10042/28840	The ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to	332.6396484375
10043/28840	At the Barriere des Sergents the procession was obliged to	36.56134033203125
10044/28840	Comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queens	110.54408264160156
10045/28840	An effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken	521.5902099609375
10046/28840	Some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the	101.5029296875
10047/28840	Onward cried DArtagnan in a loud	18.926435470581055
10048/28840	But as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded	120.79859161376953
10049/28840	Cries of Down with Mazarin Death to the cardinal resounded on all	68.30733489990234
10050/28840	At the same time through the streets of Grenelle Saint Honore and Du Coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of Swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of Porthoss horse and that of DArtagn	83.1722412109375
10051/28840	This new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed	148.58877563476562
10052/28840	It was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot but a concerted organized	75.61772918701172
10053/28840	Each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a	91.01445007324219
10054/28840	Both were evidently stimulated by the same	137.59373474121094
10055/28840	There was a shock which was perceived even in the royal	108.71697235107422
10056/28840	Myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns	287.375732421875
10057/28840	One of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the	52.872928619384766
10058/28840	One went to support DArtagnan the other Porth	19.410457611083984
10059/28840	Then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were	167.670654296875
10060/28840	Like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was	234.99778747558594
10061/28840	The musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give	113.85506439208984
10062/28840	DArtagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying   No sir I wish to see	27.493301391601562
10063/28840	If your majesty wishes to look outwell then look replied DArtagn	65.54240417480469
10064/28840	And turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musket	85.36573028564453
10065/28840	Zounds give way   At these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too	50.024288177490234
10066/28840	The blow was sped by DArtagnan the rapier had pierced his bos	64.24666595458984
10067/28840	Ah confound it cried the Gascon trying in vain too late to retract the	179.4333038330078
10068/28840	What the devil are you doing here count   Accomplishing my destiny replied Rochefort falling on one	80.7324447631836
10069/28840	I have already got up again after three stabs from you I shall never rise after this	154.70021057128906
10070/28840	Count said DArtagnan with some degree of emotion I struck without knowing that it was	35.09071731567383
10071/28840	I am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward	118.57709503173828
10072/28840	Rochefort extended his hand to DArtagnan who took	63.524723052978516
10073/28840	The count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled	131.83872985839844
10074/28840	He stiffened in the last convulsions of death and	65.56519317626953
10075/28840	Back people cried DArtagnan your leader is dead you have no longer any business	47.79341125488281
10076/28840	Indeed as if De Rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him	61.72963333129883
10077/28840	DArtagnan returned to help Porthos if Porthos needed help but Porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as DArtagn	34.5368537902832
10078/28840	The left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which Mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to	74.4954605102539
10079/28840	What a devil of a face you have Porthos and what a strange air for a victor   But you answered Porthos seem to me	66.0736312866211
10080/28840	Theres a reason Zounds I have just killed an old	95.84553527832031
10081/28840	Indeed replied Porthos who   That poor Count de Roche	28.837757110595703
10082/28840	Well exactly like me I have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to	59.55695724487305
10083/28840	Unluckily I hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with	116.92428588867188
10084/28840	And he said nothing as he died   Yes he exclaimed Oh   I suppose answered DArtagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you	45.344932556152344
10085/28840	Madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your	142.6190948486328
10086/28840	In fact the procession arrived in safety at Notre Dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a Te De	94.57513427734375
10087/28840	Bazin felt some one pulling his	267.5295715332031
10088/28840	He lowered to earth his eyes beatifically raised to Heaven and recognized Fri	274.8119201660156

10092/28840	That great giant who was there gave it to	148.728759765625
10093/28840	In that case said Bazin he must be pretty	84.88764190673828
10094/28840	So sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great	110.09976959228516
10095/28840	And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him   To be sure the coadjutor has	28.541696548461914
10096/28840	Who told you that   Monsieur Maillard	24.46761131286621

10098/28840	What were you doing there   I was shouting Down with Mazarin Death to the cardinal The Italian to the gallows Isnt that what you would have me shout   Be quiet you rascal said Bazin looking uneasily	73.8068618774414
10099/28840	So that he told me that poor Monsieur Maillard Go find the coadjutor Friquet and if you bring him to me you shall be my	43.78855514526367
10100/28840	In fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative	90.71873474121094
10101/28840	He then returned with the same slow step and said   Go and tell the dying man that he must be	64.19285583496094

10105/28840	When the Te Deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so	85.65988159179688
10106/28840	Though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet	172.12139892578125
10107/28840	The door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was	22.549144744873047
10108/28840	A moment later Friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of	71.66002655029297
10109/28840	The mendicant had kept his word and made Friquet his	95.78687286376953

10120/28840	You seemed at dinner to be anxious about	261.7430419921875
10121/28840	I was trying said Porthos to recall where I had seen that mendicant whom I must have	45.54293441772461

10131/28840	You know dear DArtagnan I am nothing more than a good honest country	46.20882034301758

10136/28840	Take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are	106.79762268066406
10137/28840	The four friends embraced with tears in their	122.28485107421875
10138/28840	Then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other	109.74889373779297
10139/28840	DArtagnan returned to the Rue Tiquetonne with Porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had	23.810733795166016

10153/28840	DArtagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair Madeleine his hostess standing on the	41.92887496948242
10154/28840	Madeleine said the Gascon give me your apartment on the first floor now that I am a captain in the royal musketeers I must make an appearance nevertheless reserve my old room on the fifth story for me one never knows what may	76.56098175048828

10156/28840	As usual a pilot put off immediately and rounding the Château dIf got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion	134.14918518066406
10157/28840	When the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ships bulw	119.04975128173828
10158/28840	He was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eyes and hair as dark as a ravens wing and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with	177.46482849121094
10159/28840	Ah is it you Dantès cried the man in the sk	31.498531341552734
10160/28840	Whats the matter and why have you such an air of sadness aboard   A great misfortune	105.07196807861328
10161/28840	Morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Lecle	45.54037094116211
10162/28840	And the cargo inquired the owner	599.561279296875
10163/28840	Morrel and I think you will be satisfied on that	62.58631134033203
10164/28840	But poor Captain Leclere   What happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable	27.659116744995117
10165/28840	What happened to the worthy captain   He	77.23445129394531

10167/28840	The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the	116.25293731689453
10168/28840	And how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted	214.93272399902344
10169/28840	0023m       Alas sir in the most unexpected	18.662622451782227
10170/28840	After a long talk with the harbormaster Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in	183.2288360595703
10171/28840	In twentyfour hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days	75.15602111816406
10172/28840	We performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirtysixpound shot at his head and his heels off El Giglio	114.13004302978516
10173/28840	We bring to his widow his sword and cross of	340.1785583496094
10174/28840	It was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the English for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody	82.33338165283203
10175/28840	Why you see Edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the	106.24256134033203
10176/28840	If not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo   Is all safe and sound	135.4285125732422
10177/28840	Morrel take my word for it and I advise you not to take 25000 francs for the profits of the	67.41688537597656
10178/28840	Then as they were just passing the Round Tower the young man shouted Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker   The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a manof	73.02549743652344
10179/28840	Let goand clue up At this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly	228.68247985839844
10180/28840	Now if you will come on board	68.30133819580078
10181/28840	Morrel said Dantès observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo	75.02243041992188
10182/28840	Danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every	45.09453582763672
10183/28840	As for me I must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in	156.0239715576172
10184/28840	The owner did not wait for a second	102.87708282470703
10185/28840	Morrel said Danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us   Yesyes poor Captain Leclere He was a brave and an honest	34.58824920654297
10186/28840	And a firstrate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel  Son replied Dangl	58.97589874267578
10187/28840	Yes said Danglars darting at Edmond a look gleaming with	67.50299835205078
10188/28840	Yes he is young and youth is invariably selfconf	195.66107177734375
10189/28840	Scarcely was the captains breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba instead of making for Marseilles	93.4539566040039
10190/28840	0025m       As to taking command of the vessel replied Morrel that was his duty as captains mate as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed	89.60476684570312
10191/28840	The vessel was in as good condition as I am and as I hope you are	86.51416015625
10192/28840	Morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing	147.71315002441406
10193/28840	Dantès said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way   In a moment sir answered Dantès and Im with	26.986082077026367
10194/28840	Then calling to the crew he said Let go   The anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the porth	197.65476989746094
10195/28840	And so in fact he is said the	90.25813293457031
10196/28840	Except your signature and your partners	290.5145568847656
10197/28840	And why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full	82.00289154052734
10198/28840	Morrel said Dantès approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and I am at your	50.11807632446289
10199/28840	You hailed me I think   Danglars retreated a step or	51.80735778808594
10200/28840	I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba   I do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere who when dying gave me a packet for Marshal Bert	45.81275939941406
10201/28840	Then did you see him Edmond   Who   The marsh	26.185970306396484
10202/28840	Morrel looked around him and then drawing Dantès on one side he said suddenly   And how is the emperor   Very well as far as I could judge from the sight of	29.545745849609375
10203/28840	You saw the emperor then   He entered the marshals apartment while I was	120.72735595703125
10204/28840	And you spoke to him   Why it was he who spoke to me sir said Dantès with a	19.57453155517578
10205/28840	And what did he say to you   Asked me questions about the vessel the time she left Marseilles the course she had taken and what was her	96.15562438964844
10206/28840	I believe if she had not been laden and I had been her master he would have bought	68.96460723876953
10207/28840	But I told him I was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel 	43.493587493896484
10208/28840	Ah yes he said I know	76.19013214111328
10209/28840	The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Val	84.91768646240234
10210/28840	_Pardieu_ and that is true cried the owner greatly	148.13148498535156
10211/28840	And that was Policar Morrel my uncle who was afterwards a	224.11578369140625
10212/28840	Dantès you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldiers	73.23479461669922
10213/28840	0027m       How could that bring me into trouble sir asked Dantès for I did not even know of what I was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first com	41.694862365722656
10214/28840	But pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming	266.6707458496094
10215/28840	And the young man went to the gang	37.95222854614258
10216/28840	As he departed Danglars approached and said   Well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at PortoFerrajo   Yes most satisfactory my dear Dangl	38.0858268737793
10217/28840	Well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his	47.12514877319336
10218/28840	Dantès has done his replied the owner and that is not saying	62.12260055541992
10219/28840	It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this	29.20829200744629
10220/28840	Talking of Captain Leclere has not Dantès given you a letter from him   To menowas there one   I believe that besides the packet Captain Leclere confided a letter to his	38.28086471557617
10221/28840	Of what packet are you speaking Danglars   Why that which Dantès left at PortoFerra	26.723695755004883
10222/28840	How do you know he had a packet to leave at PortoFerrajo   Danglars turned very	21.634090423583984
10223/28840	I was passing close to the door of the captains cabin which was half open and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantè	42.15311813354492
10224/28840	He did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it to	33.15294647216797
10225/28840	Morrel I beg of you said he not to say a word to Dantès on the	27.157543182373047
10226/28840	At this moment the young man returned Danglars	23.601232528686523
10227/28840	Well my dear Dantès are you now free inquired the	42.92348098754883
10228/28840	I gave the customhouse officers a copy of our bill of lading and as to the other papers they sent a man off with the pilot to whom I gave	88.01360321044922
10229/28840	Then you have nothing more to do here   Noeverything is all right	37.47932815551758
10230/28840	Then you can come and dine with me   I really must ask you to excuse me	31.293222427368164
10231/28840	My first visit is due to my father though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done	69.13506317138672
10232/28840	0029m       Right Dantès quite	22.703378677368164
10233/28840	I always knew you were a good	106.18107604980469
10234/28840	And inquired Dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is   Well I believe my dear Edmond though I have not seen him	24.101316452026367
10235/28840	Yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little	96.25238037109375
10236/28840	That proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your	140.26071166992188
10237/28840	My father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from	132.53211975097656
10238/28840	Well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on	93.74169158935547
10239/28840	Morrel for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to	93.43756103515625
10240/28840	True Dantès I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your fatherthe lovely Mercédè	41.912235260009766
10241/28840	Ah ha said the shipowner I am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon	36.27095413208008
10242/28840	_Peste_ Edmond you have a very handsome mistress   She is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrot	64.75598907470703
10243/28840	Sometimes one and the same thing said Morrel with a	33.942325592041016
10244/28840	Well well my dear Edmond continued the owner dont let me detain	55.41242980957031
10245/28840	You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your	61.24822998046875
10246/28840	Do you want any money   No sir I have all my pay to takenearly three months	77.42272186279297

10249/28840	I have a son too and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months	85.30582427978516
10250/28840	Then I have your leave sir   Yes if you have nothing more to say to	26.570463180541992
10251/28840	Captain Leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me   He was unable to write	38.48096466064453
10252/28840	But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some	60.8277473449707
10253/28840	To get married   Yes first and then to go to	119.2948989868164
10254/28840	Very good have what time you require Dantè	55.02760314941406

10256/28840	But the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two	131.81924438476562
10257/28840	Rely on me to procure you the other I will do my	78.57666015625
10258/28840	Morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owners hand	87.1847152709961

10263/28840	Have you been satisfied with him this voyage   That is according to the sense you attach to the question	81.5025863647461
10264/28840	If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question I believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his	54.99329376220703

10272/28840	The young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebi	57.447879791259766
10273/28840	On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailorbut there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of Edmond Dantè	47.89276123046875
10274/28840	This room was occupied by Dantès	44.65398406982422

10284/28840	Do you understand father Only imagine me a captain at twenty with a hundred louis pay and a share in the profits Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for   Yes my dear boy replied the old man it is very	75.74053192138672

10295/28840	Yes yes Edmond that is true but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor Cader	54.925289154052734
10296/28840	He reminded me of it telling me if I did not pay for you he would be paid by	63.96796417236328

10299/28840	And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you   The old man	33.69477844238281

10314/28840	Ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured Ed	237.86756896972656

10316/28840	As Edmond paused the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the	48.90150451660156
10317/28840	He was a man of twentyfive or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat	50.33341979980469

10323/28840	We are never quits with those who oblige us was Dantès reply for when we do not owe them money we owe them	143.32400512695312
10324/28840	Whats the use of mentioning that What is done is	293.5561218261719
10325/28840	Let us talk of your happy return my	156.55123901367188
10326/28840	I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth when I met friend Dangl	52.59055709838867
10327/28840	I was but am now back	434.9512634277344
10328/28840	And where is the dear boy our little Edmond   Why with his father no doubt replied Dangl	50.514530181884766
10329/28840	And so I came added Caderousse as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a	50.446144104003906
10330/28840	0037m       Worthy Caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to	21.161043167114258
10331/28840	I love and esteem you because honest folks are so	173.5005645751953
10332/28840	But it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès had thrown on the	99.33940124511719
10333/28840	The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his	116.69058227539062
10334/28840	Eh he said negligently this money is not	91.23605346679688
10335/28840	I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the	90.57025909423828
10336/28840	Come father added Dantès put this money back in your boxunless neighbor Caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his	77.33218383789062
10337/28840	I am not in any want thank God my living is suited to my	176.9971466064453
10338/28840	Keep your moneykeep it I sayone never has too muchbut at the same time my boy I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of	76.68041229248047
10339/28840	It was offered with good will said Dantè	58.61653137207031
10340/28840	Morrel I hearyou insinuating dog you  	772.1928100585938
10341/28840	Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied Dantè	52.12778854370117
10342/28840	Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with	36.997650146484375
10343/28840	What did you refuse to dine with him said old Dantès and did he invite you to dine   Yes my dear father replied Edmond smiling at his fathers astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his	32.03506851196289
10344/28840	And why did you refuse my son inquired the old	58.92417526245117
10345/28840	That I might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young	50.365169525146484
10346/28840	I was most anxious to see	23.81051254272461
10347/28840	And when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the	77.80829620361328
10348/28840	But I explained to him the cause of my refusal replied Dantès and I hope he fully understood	36.07290267944336
10349/28840	Yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to ones	151.0242462158203
10350/28840	I hope to be captain without that said Dantè	31.51519203186035
10351/28840	So much the betterso much the better Nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends and I know one down there behind the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear	78.13137817382812
10352/28840	Yes my dear father and with your permission now I have seen you and know you are well and have all you require I will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the Catal	47.096195220947266
10353/28840	No but according to all probability she soon will be replied Ed	101.94641876220703
10354/28840	Yesyes said Caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my	37.84840393066406
10355/28840	And why   Because Mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by	102.2605972290039
10356/28840	Really answered Edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneas	53.81074142456055
10357/28840	Come come said the sailor I have a better opinion than you of women in general and of Mercédès in particular and I am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to	67.58045959472656
10358/28840	So much the betterso much the better said Cader	27.352779388427734
10359/28840	When one is going to be married there is nothing like implicit confidence but never mind that my boygo and announce your arrival and let her know all your hopes and	104.68782806396484
10360/28840	I will go directly was Edmonds reply and embracing his father and nodding to Caderousse he left the	64.1251220703125
10361/28840	Caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old Dantès he went downstairs to rejoin Danglars who awaited him at the corner of the Rue Sen	28.76740264892578
10362/28840	Well said Danglars did you see him   I have just left him answered Cader	14.874472618103027
10363/28840	Did he allude to his hope of being captain   He spoke of it as a thing already	86.80266571044922
10364/28840	Indeed said Danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to	26.680023193359375
10365/28840	So that he is quite elated about it   Why yes he is actually insolent over the matterhas already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a	71.51020812988281
10366/28840	Which you refused   Most assuredly although I might easily have accepted it for it was I who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned but now	121.25542449951172
10367/28840	Dantès has no longer any occasion for assistancehe is about to become a	39.01707458496094
10368/28840	Pooh said Danglars he is not one	25.984804153442383
10369/28840	_Ma foi_ it will be as well if he is not answered Caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to	44.33834457397461
10370/28840	If we choose replied Danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he	57.70317077636719
10371/28840	What do you mean   NothingI was speaking to	32.284568786621094
10372/28840	And is he still in love with the Catalane   Over head and ears but unless I am much mistaken there will be a storm in that	94.1185073852539
10373/28840	0041m       Explain	42.4036750793457
10374/28840	Why should I   It is more important than you think	65.80081176757812
10375/28840	You do not like Dantès   I never like upst	30.192333221435547
10376/28840	Then tell me all you know about the Catal	57.86138153076172
10377/28840	I know nothing for certain only I have seen things which induce me to believe as I told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmer	66.19465637207031
10378/28840	What have you seencome tell me   Well every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping blackeyed Catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls	103.51510620117188
10379/28840	Really and you think this cousin pays her attentions   I only suppose	124.09943389892578
10380/28840	What else can a strapping chap of twentyone mean with a fine wench of seventeen   And you say that Dantès has gone to the Catalans   He went before I came	52.61927795410156
10381/28840	Let us go the same way we will stop at La Réserve and we can drink a glass of La Malgue whilst we wait for	72.2685317993164
10382/28840	Come along said Caderousse but you pay the	72.00360870361328
10383/28840	Of course replied Danglars and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two	51.914432525634766
10384/28840	The Catalans   Beyond a bare weatherworn wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the Catal	66.0210952758789
10385/28840	Long ago this mysterious colony quitted Spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this	161.77183532714844
10386/28840	Whence it came no one knew and it spoke an unknown	593.842041015625
10387/28840	One of its chiefs who understood Provençal begged the commune of Marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats	146.37596130371094
10388/28840	The request was granted and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang	156.099365234375
10389/28840	This village constructed in a singular and picturesque manner half Moorish half Spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their	210.90203857421875

10392/28840	You see Mercédès said the young man here is Easter come round again tell me is this the moment for a wedding   I have answered you a hundred times Fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me	49.524723052978516

10398/28840	I understand replied Fernand you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share	132.53244018554688
10399/28840	Well Mercédès beloved by you I would tempt fortune you would bring me good luck and I should become	66.52789306640625
10400/28840	I could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer	233.60952758789062
10401/28840	You could do no such thing Fernand you are a soldier and if you remain at the Catalans it is because there is no war so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as I cannot give you	72.33455657958984

10407/28840	No Fernand you will not thus give way to evil	311.5608825683594
10408/28840	Fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of Mercédès although for each of these tears he would have shed his hearts blood but these tears flowed for	86.60529327392578
10409/28840	And you will always love him   As long as I	53.66188430786133
10410/28840	Edmond and Mercédès were clasped in each others	30.107574462890625
10411/28840	The burning Marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of	93.27374267578125
10412/28840	At first they saw nothing around	385.9344482421875
10413/28840	Their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of	153.42388916015625
10414/28840	Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of Fernand as it was defined in the	82.37096405029297
10415/28840	By a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his	69.1843032836914
10416/28840	Ah your pardon said Dantès frowning in his turn I did not perceive that there were three of	35.07685852050781
10417/28840	Do you not remember him   Yes said Dantès and without relinquishing Mercédès hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial	32.66012191772461
10418/28840	But Fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and	191.7462921142578
10419/28840	Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed Mercédès and then again on the gloomy and menacing	69.00141906738281
10420/28840	This look told him all and his anger waxed	580.4705810546875
10421/28840	I did not know when I came with such haste to you that I was to meet an enemy	46.07476043701172
10422/28840	An enemy cried Mercédès with an angry look at her	38.21961975097656
10423/28840	An enemy in my house do you say Edmond If I believed that I would place my arm under yours and go with you to Marseilles leaving the house to return to it no	92.19647979736328
10424/28840	But you are deceived Edmond she	99.36720275878906
10425/28840	You have no enemy herethere is no one but Fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted	100.89717102050781
10426/28840	And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the Catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards Edmond and offered him his	97.52103424072266
10427/28840	His hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which Mercédès exercised over	121.65966796875
10428/28840	Scarcely however had he touched Edmonds hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the	116.22833251953125
10429/28840	Oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hairOh who will deliver me from this man Wretchedwretched that I am   Hallo Catalan Hallo Fernand where are you running to exclaimed a	145.7646942138672
10430/28840	The young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars under an ar	42.095096588134766
10431/28840	Well said Caderousse why dont you come Are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends   Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added Dangl	45.14318084716797
10432/28840	Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a	25.823854446411133
10433/28840	He seems besotted said Danglars pushing Caderousse with his	52.67428970336914
10434/28840	You called me didnt you And he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the	119.7713394165039
10435/28840	I called you because you were running like a madman and I was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said Caderousse	54.74599075317383
10436/28840	Well Fernand I must say said Caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse	109.18916320800781
10437/28840	Bah said Danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in	67.2773208618164
10438/28840	No he replied only hark how he sighs Come come Fernand said Caderousse hold up your head and answer	179.49844360351562
10439/28840	Its not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your	285.8692932128906
10440/28840	My health is well enough said Fernand clenching his hands without raising his	119.28153228759766
10441/28840	Poor Fernand has been dismissed continued Cader	80.50025177001953
10442/28840	But I thought you were a Catalan and they told me the Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a	72.59748077392578
10443/28840	It was even told me that Fernand especially was terrible in his	263.0177001953125
10444/28840	A lover is never terrible he	531.595703125
10445/28840	Poor fellow remarked Danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his	46.183773040771484
10446/28840	Why you see he did not expect to see Dantès return so suddenlyhe thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless These things always come on us more severely when they come	148.88302612304688
10447/28840	Well never mind answered Caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while Danglars had merely sipped	64.65648651123047
10448/28840	Never mindin the meantime he marries Mercédèsthe lovely Mercédèsat least he returns to do	89.86239624023438
10449/28840	During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart Caderousses words fell like molten	52.175743103027344
10450/28840	And when is the wedding to be he	179.81900024414062
10451/28840	Oh it is not yet fixed murmured	122.74536895751953
10452/28840	Well said he filling the glasses let us drink to Captain Edmond Dantès husband of the beautiful Catalane   Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a g	57.52910232543945
10453/28840	What do I see down there by the wall in the direction of the Catalans Look Fernand your eyes are better than	78.04689025878906
10454/28840	You know wine is a deceiver but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in	224.1365203857422
10455/28840	Heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing   Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand	68.61477661132812
10456/28840	Do you know them Fernand he	139.81858825683594
10457/28840	Yes was the reply in a low	25.710676193237305
10458/28840	Hold your tongue will you said Danglars pretending to restrain Caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the ar	63.22397994995117
10459/28840	Try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without	296.0857238769531
10460/28840	At this Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died and dropped again heavily on his	195.5124969482422
10461/28840	Danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with	73.9024429321289
10462/28840	I shall get nothing from these fools he muttered and I am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a	142.54464721679688
10463/28840	Heres an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big	169.05291748046875
10464/28840	Yet this Catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards Sicilians and Calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one	196.23214721679688
10465/28840	Unquestionably Edmonds star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girlhe will be captain too and laugh at us all unlessa sinister smile passed over Danglars lipsunless I take a hand in the affair he	139.3936004638672
10466/28840	Ah very well thats an explanation said Cader	70.74068450927734
10467/28840	So call me Mercédès if you	18.013566970825195
10468/28840	We must excuse our worthy neighbor Caderousse said Dantès he is so easily	49.34685134887695
10469/28840	So then the wedding is to take place immediately	184.5124053955078
10470/28840	Dantès said Danglars bowing to the young	9.59941577911377
10471/28840	Danglars today all preliminaries will be arranged at my fathers and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at La Réser	81.66889953613281
10472/28840	My friends will be there I hope that is to say you are invited	52.81465530395508
10473/28840	And Fernand said Caderousse with a chuckle Fernand too is invited   My wifes brother is my brother said Edmond and we Mercédès and I should be very sorry if he were absent at such a	41.682647705078125
10474/28840	Fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a	43.19445037841797
10475/28840	Your pardon replied Danglars I merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time the _Pharaon_ cannot be under weigh again in less than three	42.40152359008789
10476/28840	We are always in a hurry to be happy	92.19459533691406
10477/28840	Danglars for when we have suffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good	46.258544921875
10478/28840	But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste I must go to	86.09272003173828
10479/28840	Ah reallyto Paris and will it be the first time you have ever been there Dantès  	45.10647201538086
10480/28840	Have you business there   Not of my own the last commission of poor Captain Leclere you know to what I allude Danglarsit is	40.12216567993164
10481/28840	Besides I shall only take the time to go and	62.21672058105469
10482/28840	Yes yes I understand said Danglars and then in a low tone he added To Paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave	34.489540100097656
10483/28840	Ah this letter gives me an ideaa capital idea Ah Dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship _Pharaon_ then turning towards Edmond who was walking away A pleasant journey he	74.7122802734375
10484/28840	Thank you said Edmond with a friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of	64.61888122558594
10485/28840	Well my dear sir said Danglars to Fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody	37.81258010864258
10486/28840	It drives me to despair said	421.14727783203125
10487/28840	Do you then love Mercédès   I adore her   For long   As long as I have known her	38.31846618652344
10488/28840	And you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition I did not think that was the way of your	117.45560455322266
10489/28840	What would you have me do said	87.17615509033203
10490/28840	How do I know Is it my affair I am not in love with Mademoiselle Mercédès but for youin the words of the gospel seek and you shall	43.52832794189453
10491/28840	What   I would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill	48.05614471435547
10492/28840	Pooh Women say those things but never do	561.996826171875
10493/28840	You do not know Mercédès what she threatens she will	28.272472381591797
10494/28840	Thats love or I dont know what love	298.49078369140625
10495/28840	Drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all ones wit and cool	188.08522033691406
10496/28840	Idrunk said Caderousse well thats a good one I could drink four more such bottles they are no bigger than cologne fl	377.7320556640625
10497/28840	Père Pamphile more wine   And Caderousse rattled his glass upon the	68.05213165283203
10498/28840	You were saying sir said Fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted	129.99258422851562
10499/28840	This drunken Caderousse has made me lose the thread of my	81.13294982910156
10500/28840	Death alone can separate them remarked	467.2444152832031
10501/28840	You talk like a noodle my friend said Caderousse and here is Danglars who is a wideawake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are	49.752532958984375
10502/28840	Say there is no need why Dantès should die it would indeed be a pity he	49.85832214355469
10503/28840	Dantès is a good fellow I like Dantè	11.45663833618164
10504/28840	Let him run on said Danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he	47.37545394897461
10505/28840	Absence severs as well as death and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Mercédès they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tomb	67.85563659667969
10506/28840	And why I should like to know persisted Caderousse should they put Dantès in prison he has neither robbed nor killed nor	89.83120727539062
10507/28840	I wont hold my tongue replied Caderousse I say I want to know why they should put Dantès in prison I like Dantès Dantès your health and he swallowed another glass of	42.54704284667969
10508/28840	0057m       Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards Fernand said Well you understand there is no need to kill	43.976016998291016
10509/28840	Certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having Dantès	63.04100799560547
10510/28840	Have you that means   It is to be found for the	57.350738525390625
10511/28840	But why should I meddle in the matter it is no affair of	50.760406494140625
10512/28840	I know not why you meddle said Fernand seizing his arm but this I know you have some motive of personal hatred against Dantès for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of	85.40738677978516
10513/28840	No no said Fernand restraining him stay It is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against Dantè	105.04896545410156
10514/28840	I hate him I confess it	177.0142822265625
10515/28840	Do you find the means I will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for Mercédès has declared she will kill herself if Dantès is	46.98734664916992
10516/28840	I wont have Dantès killedI wont   And who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied Dangl	56.578590393066406
10517/28840	We were merely joking drink to his health he added filling Caderousses glass and do not interfere with	98.81790924072266
10518/28840	Yes yes Dantès good health said Caderousse emptying his glass heres to his health his healthhurrah   But the meansthe means said	59.76608657836914
10519/28840	Have you not hit upon any asked Dangl	46.43463134765625
10520/28840	True replied Danglars the French have the superiority over the Spaniards that the Spaniards ruminate while the French	88.62091064453125
10521/28840	Do you invent then said Fernand impatient	164.80564880371094
10522/28840	Waiter said Danglars pen ink and	48.82190704345703
10523/28840	Yes I am a supercargo pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools I am fit for	96.65214538574219
10524/28840	Pen ink and paper then called Fernand	424.76947021484375
10525/28840	Theres what you want on that table said the	217.36956787109375
10526/28840	The waiter did as he was	266.2314147949219
10527/28840	The fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said Dangl	35.6759033203125
10528/28840	Fernand filled Caderousses glass who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his hand from the paper and seized the	102.80955505371094
10529/28840	The Catalan watched him until Caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the	187.84983825683594
10530/28840	Well resumed the Catalan as he saw the final glimmer of Caderousses reason vanishing before the last glass of	62.669960021972656
10531/28840	Yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced I will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation for I know the fact	138.59133911132812
10532/28840	Yes and Mercédès Mercédès who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond   True said	38.06513214111328
10533/28840	No no continued Danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as I now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we	58.43446731567383
10534/28840	Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his cabin on board the _Pharaon	38.097354888916016
10535/28840	And Danglars wrote the address as he	46.03651428222656
10536/28840	Yes and thats all settled exclaimed Caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must	83.23822021484375
10537/28840	Yes and thats all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the	56.41681671142578
10538/28840	Dantès is my friend and I wont have him ill	59.74100875854492
10539/28840	And who thinks of using him ill Certainly neither I nor Fernand said Danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the	79.42696380615234
10540/28840	In this case replied Caderousse lets have some more	66.5557861328125
10541/28840	I wish to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercédè	20.30193519592285

10548/28840	Danglars took advantage of Caderousses temper at the moment to take him off towards Marseilles by the Porte SaintVictor staggering as he	26.500043869018555
10549/28840	When they had advanced about twenty yards Danglars looked back and saw Fernand stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pill	95.90821838378906
10550/28840	Well said Caderousse why what a lie he told He said he was going to the Catalans and he is going to the	47.00991439819336

10553/28840	The Marriage Feast   The mornings sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of rubytinted	269.67681884765625
10554/28840	The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La Réserve with whose arbor the reader is already	70.0693130493164
10555/28840	Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the _Pharaon_ had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be	79.64716339111328
10556/28840	Danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by Caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with	60.489967346191406
10557/28840	Morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La Réser	57.341796875
10558/28840	Neither Mercédès nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each	35.49827194213867

10561/28840	His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of English manufacture while from his threecornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue rib	204.36549377441406
10562/28840	Thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796 parading the newly opened gardens of the Luxembourg and Tuiler	148.86045837402344
10563/28840	Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios Mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral	156.3943328857422

10565/28840	As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Réserve	55.92913818359375
10566/28840	Morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Lecle	66.10050964355469
10567/28840	Edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of	76.1112289428711
10568/28840	Morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several	169.28573608398438
10569/28840	During this time Dantès at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored	51.10866165161133
10570/28840	Morrel was seated at his right hand Danglars at his left while at a sign from Edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most	51.289825439453125

10572/28840	A pretty silence truly said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before Mercédès	52.645355224609375
10573/28840	Now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away   Ah sighed Caderousse a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be	158.6452178955078
10574/28840	The truth is replied Dantès that I am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as	97.3801040649414
10575/28840	Danglars looked towards Fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh	265.573974609375
10576/28840	Why what ails you asked he of Ed	69.94550323486328
10577/28840	Do you fear any approaching evil I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this	135.9069061279297
10578/28840	And that is the very thing that alarms me returned Dantè	31.565937042236328
10579/28840	I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of Mercédè	60.482295989990234
10580/28840	Nay nay cried Caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor	78.05146789550781
10581/28840	Well never mind that neighbor Caderousse it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as	42.0919189453125
10582/28840	Tis true that Mercédès is not actually my wife but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will	43.43022537231445
10583/28840	A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder Dantès whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white	69.96261596679688
10584/28840	Mercédès looked pleased and gratified while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive	72.93317413330078
10585/28840	In an hour inquired Danglars turning	19.520275115966797
10586/28840	How is that my friend   Why thus it is replied Dantè	23.05596923828125

10588/28840	We have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at halfpast two oclock the Mayor of Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city	59.11140441894531
10589/28840	Now as a quarterpast one has already struck I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become Madame Dantè	56.98912811279297
10590/28840	Upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of	78.59693145751953
10591/28840	Mercédès has no fortune I have none to settle on	38.866180419921875
10592/28840	So you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very	333.379638671875
10593/28840	This joke elicited a fresh burst of	255.20632934570312
10594/28840	So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner said Dangl	60.61140441894531
10595/28840	No no answered Dantès dont imagine I am going to put you off in that shabby	52.12333679199219
10596/28840	Tomorrow morning I start for Paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time I shall be	98.76288604736328
10597/28840	I shall be back here by the first of March and on the second I give my real marriage	88.61042785644531
10598/28840	Dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Ed	42.36338424682617
10599/28840	Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of	253.99508666992188
10600/28840	Such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable	98.9669189453125
10601/28840	Everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own	103.50177764892578
10602/28840	Fernands paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Dangl	220.3489990234375
10603/28840	Caderousse approached him just as Danglars whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the	53.689823150634766
10604/28840	I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning	64.16889953613281
10605/28840	Caderousse looked full at Fernandhe was ghastly	142.57435607910156
10606/28840	Certainly continued Danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is	61.864620208740234

10609/28840	0071m       To be sureto be sure cried Dantès eagerly quitting the table let us go directly   His words were reechoed by the whole party with vociferous	49.019989013671875
10610/28840	At this moment Danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernands look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open	69.93436431884766
10611/28840	Three blows were struck upon the panel of the	185.3423614501953
10612/28840	The company looked at each other in constern	45.849178314208984
10613/28840	I demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law As no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corpor	90.3642807006836
10614/28840	Uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those	130.0602264404297
10615/28840	May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said	101.71388244628906
10616/28840	Morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew there is doubtless some mistake easily	372.48455810546875

10618/28840	Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was	523.9351196289062
10619/28840	He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effig	123.49053955078125
10620/28840	There are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to	107.39741516113281
10621/28840	He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said My worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehens	139.5136260986328
10622/28840	Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his	149.1652069091797
10623/28840	What is the meaning of all this inquired Caderousse frowningly of Danglars who had assumed an air of utter	39.079532623291016
10624/28840	0073m       How can I tell you replied he I am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out what it is	52.82456970214844
10625/28840	Caderousse then looked around for Fernand but he had	73.82516479492188
10626/28840	The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clear	106.1854248046875
10627/28840	The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his	167.6727294921875
10628/28840	Nonsense returned Danglars I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that I tore the paper to	50.198822021484375
10629/28840	No you did not answered Caderousse you merely threw it byI saw it lying in a	91.85657501220703
10630/28840	Hold your tongue you foolwhat should you know about itwhy you were drunk   Where is Fernand inquired Cader	101.24161529541016
10631/28840	How do I know replied Danglars gone as every prudent man ought to be to look after his own affairs most	69.33358001708984
10632/28840	Never mind where he is let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor	60.82649612426758

10634/28840	Dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the	39.630313873291016
10635/28840	A carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards Marse	77.5356674194336
10636/28840	Adieu adieu dearest Edmond cried Mercédès stretching out her arms to him from the	47.98558044433594
10637/28840	The prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out Goodbye Mercédèswe shall soon meet again Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of Fort Saint	133.75018310546875
10638/28840	Wait for me here all of you cried	148.896728515625
10639/28840	Morrel I will take the first conveyance I find and hurry to Marseilles whence I will bring you word how all is going	132.38906860351562
10640/28840	Thats right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can   This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left	94.1563491821289
10641/28840	The old father and Mercédès remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each others	91.10355377197266
10642/28840	He is the cause of all this miseryI am quite sure of it whispered Caderousse who had never taken his eyes off Fernand to Dangl	28.76361656188965
10643/28840	I dont think so answered the other hes too stupid to imagine such a	145.4722442626953
10644/28840	I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought	122.16297912597656
10645/28840	You dont mention those who aided and abetted the deed said Cader	192.9208526611328
10646/28840	Surely answered Danglars one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the	87.19439697265625
10647/28840	You can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebodys	293.30621337890625
10648/28840	Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different	119.47564697265625
10649/28840	What think you Danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event   Why replied he I think it just possible Dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contr	63.06942367553711
10650/28840	But how could he have done so without your knowledge Danglars since you are the ships supercargo   Why as for that I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was lad	57.45332717895508
10651/28840	I know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastrets warehouse and at Smyrna from Pascals that is all I was obliged to know and I beg I may not be asked for any further	81.47022247314453
10652/28840	Now I recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me   There you see exclaimed Dangl	65.3530044555664
10653/28840	Now the mischief is out depend upon it the customhouse people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor Dantès hidden	192.84368896484375
10654/28840	Mercédès however paid no heed to this explanation of her lovers	97.86575317382812
10655/28840	Her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sob	231.279052734375
10656/28840	Come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope   Hope repeated Dangl	53.72202682495117
10657/28840	Hope faintly murmured Fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his count	77.6178207397461
10658/28840	Good news good news shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the	236.72303771972656
10659/28840	No doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released   Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the	35.34425735473633
10660/28840	What news exclaimed a general burst of	400.04541015625
10661/28840	Morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I	103.43246459960938
10662/28840	Oh indeedindeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth Mercédè	90.86856842041016
10663/28840	Morrel but still he is charged   With what inquired the elder Dantè	64.47926330566406
10664/28840	With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is	88.67547607421875
10665/28840	A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercédès the old man sank into a	53.15771484375
10666/28840	Ah Danglars whispered Caderousse you have deceived methe trick you spoke of last night has been played but I cannot suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your	82.13876342773438
10667/28840	I am determined to tell them all about	25.075275421142578
10668/28840	Be silent you simpleton cried Danglars grasping him by the arm or I will not answer even for your own	49.60094451904297
10669/28840	Who can tell whether Dantès be innocent or guilty The vessel did touch at Elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the	110.58277893066406
10670/28840	Suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his	147.08660888671875
10671/28840	If he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty if guilty why it is no use involving ourselves in a	102.65754699707031
10672/28840	With all my heart replied Danglars pleased to find the other so tract	63.70891571044922
10673/28840	Let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their	70.69242858886719
10674/28840	After their departure Fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of Mercédès led the girl to her home while some friends of Dantès conducted his father nearly lifeless to the Allées de Meil	45.389095306396484
10675/28840	The rumor of Edmonds arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the	95.85701751708984
10676/28840	Could you ever have credited such a thing my dear Danglars asked	43.86212158203125
10677/28840	Morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of Dantès from	61.6971435546875
10678/28840	de Villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and Cader	39.83089065551758
10679/28840	Could you have believed such a thing possible   Why you know I told you replied Danglars that I considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very suspicious	29.494909286499023
10680/28840	And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself   0079m       Certainly not returned Dangl	32.92403793334961
10681/28840	Then added in a low whisper You understand that on account of your uncle	111.6802749633789
10682/28840	Policar Morrel who served under the _other_ government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of	186.72378540039062
10683/28840	I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself had I divulged my own apprehensions to a	135.07696533203125
10684/28840	I am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all	152.46630859375
10685/28840	You are a worthy fellow and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the _Pharaon	33.408203125
10686/28840	Is it possible you were so kind   Yes indeed I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between	53.620323181152344
10687/28840	And what was his reply   That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference	154.2480926513672
10688/28840	No one can deny his being a noblehearted young	224.69906616210938

10690/28840	Oh replied Danglars since we cannot leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantès will be set at	33.04752731323242
10691/28840	No doubt but in the meantime   I am entirely at your service	39.25286102294922
10692/28840	Thanks Danglarsthat will smooth over all	76.34899139404297
10693/28840	I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the _Pharaon_ and look carefully to the unloading of her	46.1756706237793
10694/28840	Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with	37.553802490234375

10702/28840	Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence   Not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such	99.94489288330078
10703/28840	But who perpetrated that joke let me ask neither you nor myself but Fernand you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the roomindeed I fancied I had destroyed	77.919677734375
10704/28840	Oh no replied Caderousse that I can answer for you did	23.2275390625
10705/28840	I only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the ar	67.25458526611328
10706/28840	Well then if you did depend upon it Fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying	163.48866271972656
10707/28840	And now I think of it by Heavens he may have sent the letter itself Fortunately for me the handwriting was	129.6591033935547

10710/28840	It seems however that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the	207.8185272216797
10711/28840	Still argued Caderousse I would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that I had had no hand in	82.70822143554688
10712/28840	You will see Danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of	70.84188079833984

10714/28840	How can we be implicated in any way All we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting	117.4852294921875
10715/28840	So far then said Danglars mentally all has gone as I would have	49.27320098876953

10734/28840	What I was saying Villefort was that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or	81.95160675048828

10801/28840	I give you his very words and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his	76.83399963378906
10802/28840	0091m       That is true answered the marqu	14.429425239562988

10820/28840	Should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the _Pharaon	29.489025115966797
10821/28840	But said Renée this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the kings	61.8095703125
10822/28840	0093m       True but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused	144.05014038085938
10823/28840	Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the marqu	97.6660385131836
10824/28840	Nay dear mother say the accused	615.8530883789062
10825/28840	You know we cannot yet pronounce him	511.8291320800781
10826/28840	He is in safe custody answered Villefort and rely upon it if the letter is found he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the heads	67.01646423339844
10827/28840	And where is the unfortunate being asked Ren	131.3214874267578

10849/28840	At this moment and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue des Conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached it was	36.15835952758789

10852/28840	I know it monsieur replied Villefort and I am now going to examine	15.953155517578125

10857/28840	Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel and replied coldly   You are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great	53.01062774658203
10858/28840	Is it not true   The magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indul	78.69788360595703
10859/28840	Morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics besides what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grandmarshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed	60.89094924926758
10860/28840	He replied however in a tone of deep interest   I entreat you	33.7639274597168
10861/28840	de Villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us	120.1672134399414
10862/28840	This _give us_ sounded revolutionary in the deputys	212.96368408203125
10863/28840	Ah ah murmured he is Dantès then a member of some Carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form He was if I recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many	151.27548217773438

10866/28840	Rapid as had been Villeforts glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrog	55.39924240112305
10867/28840	He had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly	179.74459838867188
10868/28840	Villeforts first impression was favorable but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two	132.22377014160156
10869/28840	He stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his	117.01844024658203
10870/28840	He was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in	75.63027954101562
10871/28840	It was then that he encountered for the first time Villeforts lookthat look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his	74.9123306274414
10872/28840	My name is Edmond Dantès replied the young man calmly I am mate of the _Pharaon_ belonging to Mess	17.680543899536133

10874/28840	You were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of	45.04707717895508
10875/28840	Yes monsieur I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three	27.753629684448242
10876/28840	This philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at	127.80569458007812
10877/28840	de SaintMérans and he arranged mentally while Dantès awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloqu	113.7870101928711
10878/28840	When this speech was arranged Villefort turned to Dantè	35.643768310546875

10883/28840	It is reported your political opinions are extreme said Villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an	63.08349609375
10884/28840	Alas sir I never had any	271.35565185546875
10885/28840	I am hardly nineteen I know nothing I have no part to	78.35306549072266
10886/28840	If I obtain the situation I desire I shall owe it to	98.25357055664062
10887/28840	Thus all my opinionsI will not say public but privateare confined to these three sentimentsI love my father I respect	291.6374206542969
10888/28840	This sir is all I can tell you and you see how uninteresting it	31.26679229736328
10889/28840	As Dantès spoke Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of Renée who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for	64.90653228759766
10890/28840	With the deputys knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his	167.5764923095703
10891/28840	_Pardieu_ said Villefort he is a noble	27.260089874267578
10892/28840	I hope I shall gain Renées favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on	287.9386291503906
10893/28840	I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in	108.8661117553711
10894/28840	Full of this idea Villeforts face became so joyous that when he turned to Dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling	64.19659423828125
10895/28840	Sir said Villefort have you any enemies at least that you	37.96790313720703
10896/28840	I have enemies replied Dantès my position is not sufficiently elevated for	68.35738372802734
10897/28840	As for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but I have striven to repress	128.93536376953125
10898/28840	I have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for I am too young but as an elder	88.25798797607422
10899/28840	You are about to become captain at nineteenan elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of	126.6510238647461
10900/28840	You are right you know men better than I do and what you say may possibly be the case I confess but if such persons are among my acquaintances I prefer not to know it because then I should be forced to hate	92.61141204833984
10901/28840	You are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around	386.2258605957031
10902/28840	You seem a worthy young man I will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this	91.6591567993164
10903/28840	Here is the paper do you know the writing As he spoke Villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Dantè	30.697572708129883
10904/28840	A cloud passed over his brow as he said   No monsieur I do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably	24.54498291015625
10905/28840	I am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at Villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real	55.502017974853516
10906/28840	And by the rapid glance that the young mans eyes shot forth Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mild	117.15416717529297
10907/28840	I will tell you the real	67.27067565917969
10908/28840	I swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for Mercédès by the life of my father   Speak monsieur said Ville	21.596506118774414
10909/28840	Then internally If Renée could see me I hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapit	167.83950805664062
10910/28840	Well when we quitted Naples Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain	58.55705642700195
10911/28840	As we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at Elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to	62.119102478027344
10912/28840	My dear Dantès said he swear to perform what I am going to tell you for it is a matter of the deepest	23.87151527404785
10913/28840	You will accomplish what I was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from	90.4302749633789
10914/28840	I will do it captain but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the grandmarshals presence as easily as you expect   Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the	89.77387237548828
10915/28840	At these words he gave me a	58.291534423828125
10916/28840	It was timetwo hours after he was delirious the next day he	85.10130310058594
10917/28840	And what did you do then   What I ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my	25.96251106262207
10918/28840	Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are	138.25225830078125
10919/28840	I sailed for the Island of Elba where I arrived the next day I ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore	71.62689208984375
10920/28840	As I had expected I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grandmarshal but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him and was instantly	80.23384857177734
10921/28840	He questioned me concerning Captain Lecleres death and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in	75.76856231689453
10922/28840	I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me	209.94480895996094
10923/28840	I landed here regulated the affairs of the vessel and hastened to visit my affianced bride whom I found more lovely than	81.04811096191406
10924/28840	Ah said Villefort this seems to me the	26.1313419342041
10925/28840	If you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your	37.08291244506836
10926/28840	Give up this letter you have brought from Elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your	129.893310546875
10927/28840	I am free then sir cried Dantès joy	35.62666702270508
10928/28840	Yes but first give me this	171.9384002685547
10929/28840	You have it already for it was taken from me with some others which I see in that	118.77401733398438
10930/28840	Stop a moment said the deputy as Dantès took his hat and	26.4595947265625

10933/28840	He sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of	84.43031311035156
10934/28840	Yes said Dantès do you know him   No replied Villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspir	19.339813232421875

10936/28840	I have however already told you sir I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the	43.25888442993164
10937/28840	Yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said Ville	31.82175636291504
10938/28840	I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give	94.84343719482422
10939/28840	Have you shown this letter to anyone asked Villefort becoming still more	109.75952911376953
10940/28840	Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the Island of Elba and addressed to	31.286815643310547
10941/28840	Noirtier   Everybody except the person who gave it to	53.7049446105957
10942/28840	And that was too much far too much murmured Ville	32.861419677734375
10943/28840	Villeforts brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled Dantès with	111.30303192138672
10944/28840	After reading the letter Villefort covered his face with his	32.133872985839844
10945/28840	Oh said Dantès timidly what is the matter Villefort made no answer but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the	27.487266540527344
10946/28840	It is for me to give orders here and not	70.5837631225586

10949/28840	Dantès waited expecting a question but in	57.72034454345703
10950/28840	Villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the	30.42013931274414
10951/28840	Oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that Noirtier is the father of Villefort I am lost And he fixed his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his	38.406036376953125
10952/28840	Oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he	73.85900115966797
10953/28840	In heavens name cried the unhappy young man if you doubt me question me I will answer	111.80186462402344

10955/28840	0105m       Well I must detain you some time longer but I will strive to make it as short as	42.07149124145508
10956/28840	The principal charge against you is this letter and you see Villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely	124.29497528076172
10957/28840	You see I destroy it   Oh exclaimed Dantès you are goodness	57.68897247314453
10958/28840	Listen continued Villefort you can now have confidence in me after what I have	57.03322219848633
10959/28840	Listen this is not a command but advice I give	93.83064270019531

10963/28840	It was Villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured	41.104698181152344
10964/28840	You see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and I alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of itdeny it boldly and you are	207.97267150878906
10965/28840	It was the only letter you had   It	51.20146560668945
10966/28840	Villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his	67.89716339111328
10967/28840	Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself halffainting into a	52.1809196472168

10970/28840	Oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes Suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eyes were fixed in	115.74053955078125
10971/28840	This will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me I will make my	61.24121856689453

10974/28840	The Château dIf   The commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on Dantès right and the other on his	17.737506866455078
10975/28840	A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest	123.00575256347656
10976/28840	The Palais de Justice communicated with the prisona sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clocktower of the Accou	84.7306900024414
10977/28840	After numberless windings Dantès saw a door with an iron w	82.42003631591797
10978/28840	The commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to Dantès as if struck on his	77.85865783691406
10979/28840	The door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind	58.96029281616211
10980/28840	The air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitiche was in	188.02352905273438
10981/28840	He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the words of Villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of	97.81629943847656
10982/28840	It was four oclock when Dantès was placed in this	21.40747833251953
10983/28840	It was as we have said the 1st of March and the prisoner was soon buried in	64.42772674560547
10984/28840	The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and Dantès sank again into his	71.98174285888672
10985/28840	By the torchlight Dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarm	69.46041107177734
10986/28840	He had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of	91.6006088256836
10987/28840	Are you come to fetch me asked	49.36478805541992
10988/28840	By the orders of the deputy procureur   I believe	25.43909454345703
10989/28840	The conviction that they came from	114.00885772705078
10990/28840	de Villefort relieved all Dantès apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the	37.709476470947266
10991/28840	A carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside	71.41881561279297

10998/28840	Can all this force be summoned on my account thought	159.6109161376953
10999/28840	The officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered Dantès question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the	57.318729400634766

11003/28840	In an instant he was placed in the sternsheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow a shove sent the boat adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the Pil	97.43508911132812
11004/28840	At a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as Dantès knew in the Frioul and outside the inner	112.90165710449219

11010/28840	Dantès trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained	63.51493835449219
11011/28840	The most vague and wild thoughts passed through his	296.9230041503906

11016/28840	How was it that a presentiment did not warn Mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her   One light alone was visible and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès	34.647865295410156
11017/28840	Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole	39.062774658203125
11018/28840	A loud cry could be heard by	277.49554443359375

11024/28840	In spite of his repugnance to address the guards Dantès turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand   Comrade said he I adjure you as a Christian and a soldier to tell me where we are	38.49591064453125

11032/28840	This gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to Dantès like a scaffold to a malef	90.48694610595703

11037/28840	Dantès pressed the gendarmes hand as though he would crush	25.863746643066406
11038/28840	You think then said he that I am taken to the Château dIf to be imprisoned there   It is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so	28.172746658325195

11043/28840	For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken	141.70970153808594

11059/28840	Dantès was alone in darkness and in silencecold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning	64.24010467529297
11060/28840	With the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave Dantès where he	56.02274703979492
11061/28840	He found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with	159.9945831298828
11062/28840	He had passed the night standing and without	154.4666290283203
11063/28840	The jailer advanced Dantès appeared not to perceive	57.77560806274414
11064/28840	Have you not slept said the jail	66.81832122802734
11065/28840	Do you wish for anything   I wish to see the	18.138330459594727
11066/28840	The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the	59.891754150390625
11067/28840	Dantès followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door but the door	22.443077087402344
11068/28840	All his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus	134.5443878173828
11069/28840	The day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its	195.62066650390625
11070/28840	He had no fears as to how he should livegood seamen are welcome	182.79721069335938
11071/28840	The thought was maddening and Dantès threw himself furiously down on his	37.96405792236328
11072/28840	The next morning at the same hour the jailer came	47.74381637573242
11073/28840	Well said the jailer are you more reasonable today Dantès made no	33.04912567138672

11075/28840	I have already told you it was	19.9547061920166
11076/28840	Why so   Because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for	122.11463928222656
11077/28840	What is allowed then   Better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk	131.55889892578125
11078/28840	I do not want books I am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but I wish to see the	50.44156265258789

11081/28840	The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued	121.95722961425781
11082/28840	What you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his	49.2357292175293

11086/28840	You think so   Yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before	88.94879913330078

11091/28840	Well said Dantès mark this if you refuse at least to tell Mercédès I am here I will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter I will dash out your brains with this	54.45903015136719
11092/28840	Threats cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going	166.8390655517578
11093/28840	The abbé began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons	115.60010528564453
11094/28840	Dantès whirled the stool round his	46.194400787353516
11095/28840	All right all right said the jailer all right since you will have it	75.0560302734375

11097/28840	Very well returned Dantès dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality	60.16072082519531
11098/28840	The jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four	62.61768341064453

11101/28840	Yes we must put the madman with the mad	117.44422912597656
11102/28840	The soldiers seized Dantès who followed	85.8083267211914
11103/28840	He descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust	78.25401306152344
11104/28840	The door closed and Dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the	53.91835021972656
11105/28840	The jailer was right Dantès wanted but little of being utterly	80.13729858398438

11112/28840	So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days so added he turning to Renée judge for yourself if it be not	82.50897979736328
11113/28840	You are going to leave us cried Renée unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected	62.952754974365234

11119/28840	Well asked he as soon as they were by themselves tell me what it is   An affair of the greatest importance that demands my immediate presence in	67.11109161376953
11120/28840	Now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property   All my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand franc	77.34689331054688

11123/28840	Then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instants delay perhaps even now I shall arrive too	94.06776428222656
11124/28840	The deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then   And sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market	65.5791015625
11125/28840	Now then said Villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook I must have another   To whom   To the	29.595422744750977

11130/28840	Doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with	122.96346282958984
11131/28840	The keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to	108.04141998291016
11132/28840	I tell you marquis my fortune is made if I only reach the Tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service I do	50.30073928833008

11142/28840	Villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary	97.58746337890625
11143/28840	At his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for	57.81990051269531
11144/28840	It was Mercédès who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after	44.524330139160156
11145/28840	As Villefort drew near she advanced and stood before	53.82136917114258
11146/28840	Dantès had spoken of Mercédès and Villefort instantly recognized	13.999858856201172
11147/28840	Her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the	100.51095581054688
11148/28840	The young man you speak of said Villefort abruptly is a great criminal and I can do nothing for him mademois	27.707918167114258

11292/28840	Dandré is not a man to be accused of treason Sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is	69.37008666992188

11298/28840	Is he then advancing on Paris The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avow	124.00460815429688

11305/28840	The minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out   By the telegraph s	62.911312103271484
11306/28840	advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as Napoleon would have	173.0784912109375
11307/28840	0141m       So then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that	68.00908660888672
11308/28840	A miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after fiveandtwenty years of	81.38343811035156
11309/28840	What our enemies say of us is then	285.8616638183594
11310/28840	de Blacas wiped the moisture from his	131.75389099121094
11311/28840	Villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased	193.13705444335938
11312/28840	To fall continued King Louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspendedto fall and learn of that fall by telegraph Oh I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother Louis	195.6600341796875
11313/28840	than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away by	136.4575653076172
11314/28840	Ridicule sirwhy you know not its power in France and yet you ought to know it   Sire sire murmured the minister for pitys   Approach	73.35820770263672
11315/28840	de Villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a	55.553043365478516
11316/28840	Approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not	36.60888671875
11317/28840	Sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the	119.34707641601562
11318/28840	Really impossible Yesthat is a great word	173.75946044921875
11319/28840	Unfortunately there are great words as there are great men I have measured	111.8670883178711
11320/28840	The look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort who bent his head in modest	97.92891693115234
11321/28840	I do not mean that for you Blacas continued Louis XV	41.83702087402344
11322/28840	for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your	50.64167785644531
11323/28840	Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of	126.05497741699219
11324/28840	de Villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal	219.42652893066406
11325/28840	These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour	67.46207427978516
11326/28840	Any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably	108.2154312133789
11327/28840	In fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth Napoleons secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villeforts	85.90154266357422
11328/28840	Realizing this Villefort came to the rescue of the crestfallen minister instead of aiding to crush	107.0478515625
11329/28840	Do not attribute to me more than I deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of	66.23223114013672
11330/28840	And now gentlemen he continued turning towards	362.2347717285156
11331/28840	de Blacas and the minister of police I have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of	55.40220642089844
11332/28840	de Blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and	139.69923400878906
11333/28840	Do not mention reports duke to me for I know now what confidence to place in	177.30514526367188
11334/28840	Yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue SaintJacques   The affair in the Rue SaintJacques exclaimed Villefort unable to repress an ex	26.234649658203125
11335/28840	Then suddenly pausing he added Your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect I have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of	93.07661437988281
11336/28840	Go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries	140.76341247558594
11337/28840	On the contrary siron the contrary said Louis XV	79.60953521728516
11338/28840	this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of General Quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal	90.29437255859375
11339/28840	At the name of General Quesnel Villefort tremb	13.307979583740234
11340/28840	Everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of	109.83245086669922
11341/28840	General Quesnel it appears had just left a Bonapartist club when he	47.62899398803711
11342/28840	An unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the Rue SaintJacques unfortunately the generals valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the	71.4554672241211
11343/28840	As the police minister related this to the king Villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speakers lips turned alternately red and	138.6299285888672
11344/28840	Do you not think with me	86.16548919677734
11345/28840	de Villefort that General Quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush   It is probable sire replied Ville	25.479537963867188
11346/28840	But is this all that is known   They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with	49.275901794433594
11347/28840	Yes the servant has given his	182.0799560546875
11348/28840	He is a man of from fifty to fiftytwo years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moust	74.64553833007812
11349/28840	He was dressed in a blue frockcoat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his buttonhole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of	17.388916015625
11350/28840	Yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue CoqHé	46.09941864013672
11351/28840	Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed	68.12836456298828
11352/28840	It required all Villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired	90.58101654052734
11353/28840	How strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say A murder has been committed and especially so when they can add And we are on the track of the guilty	145.44227600097656
11354/28840	Sire your majesty will I trust be amply satisfied on this point at	109.15247344970703
11355/28840	I will no longer detain you	93.54379272460938
11356/28840	de Villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and	57.74443435668945
11357/28840	Of course you stopped at your fathers A feeling of faintness came over Ville	175.48931884765625
11358/28840	0145m       No sire he replied I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid in the Rue de Tourn	23.590124130249023
11359/28840	But you have seen him   Sire I went straight to the Duc de Bl	14.445865631103516
11360/28840	But you will see him then   I think not s	23.67751121520996
11361/28840	Ah I forgot said Louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive I forgot you and	122.8150405883789
11362/28840	Noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recomp	112.14395141601562
11363/28840	Sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing more to ask	75.31376647949219
11364/28840	Never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind	85.85420227050781
11365/28840	In the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of	72.30859375
11366/28840	Louis above the order of NotreDameduMontCarmel and	328.1254577636719
11367/28840	Lazare and gave it to Villefortin the meanwhile take this	140.91055297851562
11368/28840	Sire said Villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officers	87.267822265625
11369/28840	take it such as it is for I have not the time to procure you	52.71286392211914
11370/28840	Blacas let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to	134.94427490234375
11371/28840	Villeforts eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride he took the cross and kissed	62.10432434082031
11372/28840	Sire replied Villefort bowing in an hour I shall have quitted	23.453020095825195
11373/28840	Go sir said the king and should I forget you kings memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my	122.9049072265625
11374/28840	Baron send for the minister of	374.4034423828125
11375/28840	Ah sir said the minister of police to Villefort as they left the Tuileries you entered by lucks dooryour fortune is	82.6021957397461
11376/28840	Will it be long first muttered Villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackneyco	51.719093322753906
11377/28840	One passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of	120.8897476196289
11378/28840	Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to	107.20401000976562
11379/28840	He was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and	82.50363159179688
11380/28840	The valet opened the door and Villefort heard someone speak his	57.87575912475586
11381/28840	0147m       Who could know that I was here already said the young	20.64422035217285
11382/28840	Well said Villefort what is itWho rangWho asked for me   A stranger who will not send in his	48.24641799926758
11383/28840	A stranger who will not send in his name What can he want with me   He wishes to speak to	46.149169921875
11384/28840	Did he mention my name  	70.5422134399414
11385/28840	What sort of person is he   Why sir a man of about	67.17060852050781
11386/28840	Short or tall   About your own height	217.42367553710938

11388/28840	In a blue frockcoat buttoned up close decorated with the Legion of	21.790552139282227
11389/28840	It is he said Villefort turning	15.392179489135742
11390/28840	Well then if you felt so sure replied the newcomer putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair allow me to say my dear Gérard that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the	47.216094970703125
11391/28840	The servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of aston	104.06733703613281
11392/28840	Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to Villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not	41.8432731628418
11393/28840	Noirtier seating himself I might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of February and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in	65.09554290771484
11394/28840	And if I have come my dear father said Gérard drawing closer to	46.78406524658203
11395/28840	Noirtier do not complain for it is for you that I came and my journey will be your	54.30796432495117
11396/28840	Noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the	89.62976837158203
11397/28840	Really pray tell me all about it for it must be	71.83012390136719
11398/28840	Father you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue SaintJacques  	15.081075668334961
11399/28840	Why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from Paris in a haycart been hunted over the plains of Bordeaux by Robespierres bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most	122.76071166992188
11400/28840	0151m       And who told you this fine story   The king	23.29206657409668
11401/28840	Well then in return for your story continued Noirtier I will tell you	45.1412467956543
11402/28840	My dear father I think I already know what you are about to tell	34.90736770629883
11403/28840	Ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor   Not so loud father I entreat of youfor your own sake as well as	49.618141174316406
11404/28840	Yes I heard this news and knew it even before you could for three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible speed halfdesperate at the enforced	143.6622314453125
11405/28840	Why three days ago the emperor had not	77.87696075439453
11406/28840	No matter I was aware of his	191.9307098388672
11407/28840	How did you know about it   By a letter addressed to you from the Island of El	16.288881301879883
11408/28840	To me   To you and which I discovered in the pocketbook of the	45.939273834228516
11409/28840	Had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been	142.4998016357422
11410/28840	Come come said he will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly Shot my dear boy What an idea Where is the letter you speak of I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass	98.1768569946289
11411/28840	I burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your	191.87828063964844
11412/28840	And the destruction of your future prospects replied Noirtier yes I can easily comprehend	60.360225677490234
11413/28840	But I have nothing to fear while I have you to protect	37.606224060058594
11414/28840	I do better than that sirI save	118.11017608642578
11415/28840	You do Why really the thing becomes more and more dramaticexplain	284.9173889160156
11416/28840	I must refer again to the club in the Rue SaintJac	29.4083251953125
11417/28840	It appears that this club is rather a bore to the	235.57345581054688
11418/28840	Why didnt they search more vigilantly they would have found   They have not found but they are on the	133.43675231933594
11419/28840	Yes that the usual phrase I am quite familiar with	119.01240539550781
11420/28840	When the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is	116.61482238769531
11421/28840	Yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a	115.49349975585938
11422/28840	A murder do you call it why there is nothing to prove that the general was	93.29598236083984
11423/28840	People are found every day in the Seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to	201.8032989501953
11424/28840	Father you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of	54.60718536376953
11425/28840	No no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the	164.30667114257812
11426/28840	And who thus designated it   The king	89.7774658203125
11427/28840	The king I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in	90.48065185546875
11428/28840	In politics my dear fellow you know as well as I do there are no men but ideasno feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is	88.07044982910156
11429/28840	Would you like to know how matters have progressed Well I will tell	57.46828842163086
11430/28840	It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba one of us went to him and invited him to the Rue SaintJacques where he would find some	30.727294921875
11431/28840	He came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba the projected landing	172.80882263183594
11432/28840	When he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royal	70.71215057373047
11433/28840	Then all looked at each otherhe was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart freeperfectly	111.21697235107422
11434/28840	What could that mean why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way thats	192.28814697265625
11435/28840	A murder really Villefort you surprise	306.14739990234375
11436/28840	But father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be	521.0768432617188
11437/28840	You rely on the usurpers return   We	71.50138092041016
11438/28840	You are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of France without being followed tracked and caught like a wild	99.61917114257812
11439/28840	My dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble on the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons and on the 20th or 25th at	63.69318389892578
11440/28840	He has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against	81.82903289794922
11441/28840	Yes to escort him into the	86.60859680175781
11442/28840	Really my dear Gérard you are but a child you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing The usurper has landed at Cannes with several	103.743896484375
11443/28840	But where is he what is he doing You do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to Paris without drawing a	62.712825775146484
11444/28840	Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable	214.22744750976562
11445/28840	Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmall Lyons will hasten to welcome	277.698486328125
11446/28840	Believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your	113.43032836914062
11447/28840	Would you like a proof of it well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet I knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the	61.514869689941406
11448/28840	You gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet I have your address and in proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at	103.11119842529297
11449/28840	Ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine	86.46726989746094
11450/28840	Indeed replied Villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well	48.81879425048828
11451/28840	You who are in power have only the means that money produceswe who are in expectation have those which devotion	261.7261962890625
11452/28840	Yes devotion for that is I believe the phrase for hopeful	301.25921630859375
11453/28840	And Villeforts father extended his hand to the bellrope to summon the servant whom his son had not	85.43051147460938

11457/28840	Ah ha thats it is it said Noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him   Because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the Rue CoqHé	48.07001876831055
11458/28840	Didnt I say that your police were good for nothing   Yes but they may catch him	86.5365219116211
11459/28840	True said Noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile He will consequently make a few changes in his personal	101.64503479003906
11460/28840	At these words he rose and put off his frockcoat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his sons toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whisk	87.0596694946289
11461/28840	Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of	216.5068359375
11462/28840	Well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me	142.4180145263672
11463/28840	No father stammered Villefort at least I hope	37.61916732788086
11464/28840	And now my dear boy continued Noirtier I rely on your prudence to remove all the things which I leave in your	57.07356643676758
11465/28840	Yes yes and now I believe you are right and that you have really saved my life be assured I will return the favor	69.55995178222656
11466/28840	You are not convinced yet   I hope at least that you may be	38.41057586669922

11473/28840	Go my songo my dear Gérard and by your obedience to my paternal orders or if you prefer it friendly counsels we will keep you in your	114.60187530517578
11474/28840	This will be added Noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me	161.4977569580078
11475/28840	Adieu my dear Gérard and at your next journey alight at my	115.32168579101562

11477/28840	Villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the Rue B	112.81421661376953
11478/28840	Noirtier was a true prophet and things progressed rapidly as he had	105.77387237548828
11479/28840	Everyone knows the history of the famous return from Elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the	89.30528259277344

11481/28840	Villefort therefore gained nothing save the kings gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the Legion of Honor which he had the prudence not to wear although	72.20694732666016
11482/28840	de Blacas had duly forwarded the bre	156.5076446533203
11483/28840	Napoleon would doubtless have deprived Villefort of his office had it not been for Noirtier who was all powerful at court and thus the Girondin of 93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his	96.72557830810547

11490/28840	The deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of Marseilles when one morning his door opened and	83.81114196777344
11491/28840	Anyone else would have hastened to receive him but Villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of	47.8215217590332
11492/28840	He made Morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the kings procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered	65.05699920654297

11511/28840	I recollect now it was a very serious	71.2625732421875
11512/28840	How so   You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de	25.78740692138672
11513/28840	Well   I made my report to the authorities at Paris and a week after he was carried	70.7743911743164
11514/28840	What can they have done with him   Oh he has been taken to Fenestrelles to Pignerol or to the SainteMarguérite	101.68628692626953
11515/28840	Some fine morning he will return to take command of your	108.65975952148438
11516/28840	Come when he will it shall be kept for	88.0987548828125
11517/28840	But how is it he is not already returned It seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to	54.1796989440918
11518/28840	The order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as Napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been	169.9735870361328

11523/28840	Had Morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled	181.28976440429688
11524/28840	de Villefort how would you advise me to act asked	34.889835357666016
11525/28840	Oh I know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read	107.71575164794922
11526/28840	That is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by	153.32493591308594
11527/28840	And will you undertake to deliver it   With the greatest	58.61124801635742
11528/28840	Dantès was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn	50.00597381591797
11529/28840	Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defence	151.0084686279297
11530/28840	But how shall I address the minister   Sit down there said Villefort giving up his place to Morrel and write what I	63.208248138427734
11531/28840	Will you be so good  	47.19710159301758
11532/28840	But lose no time we have lost too much	73.9832534790039
11533/28840	Only think what the poor fellow may even now be	321.03228759765625
11534/28840	Villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw	39.241878509521484
11535/28840	Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villeforts	35.1480827331543
11536/28840	Villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt Dantès patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of Napoleons	76.55233001708984
11537/28840	It was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release	70.21835327148438
11538/28840	The petition finished Villefort read it	358.92205810546875
11539/28840	That will do said he leave the rest to	134.7444305419922
11540/28840	Will the petition go soon  	415.57562255859375
11541/28840	Countersigned by you   The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your	139.87486267089844
11542/28840	And sitting down Villefort wrote the certificate at the	93.63943481445312
11543/28840	What more is to be done   I will do whatever is	51.45183563232422
11544/28840	This assurance delighted Morrel who took leave of Villefort and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he would soon see his	44.46189880371094
11545/28840	As for Villefort instead of sending to Paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second	71.32117462158203
11546/28840	Dantès remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis XV	33.40717315673828
11547/28840	s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the	322.2619934082031
11548/28840	Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand and twice had Villefort soothed him with	166.28912353515625
11549/28840	At last there was Waterloo and Morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself useless	135.97543334960938
11550/28840	And so Dantès after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and	123.74771881103516
11551/28840	Danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed Dantès and when Napoleon returned to France he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence _a decree of Providence	75.67366790771484
11552/28840	But when Napoleon returned to Paris Danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of Dantès return on a mission of	64.03871154785156

11554/28840	He then left for Madrid and was no more heard	155.89309692382812
11555/28840	Fernand understood nothing except that Dantès was	48.23311996459961
11556/28840	What had become of him he cared not to	101.23365020751953
11557/28840	Fernands mind was made up he would shoot Dantès and then kill	266.3034973144531
11558/28840	But Fernand was mistaken a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly	210.73475646972656
11559/28840	During this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the	179.3401641845703
11560/28840	Fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry Mercédè	120.99597930908203
11561/28840	Had Fernand really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from Mercédè	48.795291900634766
11562/28840	His devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble mindsMercédès had always had a sincere regard for Fernand and this was now strengthened by	108.69193267822266
11563/28840	My brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed I shall be alone in the	96.17654418945312
11564/28840	These words carried a ray of hope into Fernands	221.3740234375

11569/28840	It was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved	256.30828857421875

11579/28840	He inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to	76.4457015991211
11580/28840	The universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set	114.54505920410156

11582/28840	What could they desire beyond their liberty The inspector turned smilingly to the	351.2562255859375

11605/28840	He used to weep he now laughs he grew thin he now grows	391.1512145996094
11606/28840	You had better see him for his madness is	162.41668701171875
11607/28840	I will see them both returned the inspector I must conscientiously perform my	69.70255279541016
11608/28840	This was the inspectors first visit he wished to display his	153.09291076660156
11609/28840	Let us visit this one first added	414.0987548828125
11610/28840	By all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the	54.030216217041016
11611/28840	At the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges Dantès who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his	44.0077018737793
11612/28840	Seeing a stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded Dantès who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped	107.12940216064453
11613/28840	The soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three	67.48777770996094
11614/28840	Dantès saw that he was looked upon as	23.732023239135742
11615/28840	Then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with	151.15579223632812
11616/28840	The inspector listened attentively then turning to the governor observed He will become religioushe is already more gentle he is afraid and retreated before the bayonetsmadmen are not afraid of anything I made some curious observations on this at Charent	150.54344177246094
11617/28840	Then turning to the prisoner What is it you want said	41.39201736450195
11618/28840	I want to know what crime I have committedto be tried and if I am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at	79.3146743774414
11619/28840	Are you well fed said the	71.16463470458984
11620/28840	I believe so I dont know its of no	137.02593994140625
11621/28840	What matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his execution	114.0976791381836
11622/28840	You are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turn	93.83238983154297
11623/28840	It is true sir and I beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but I was	47.62932586669922
11624/28840	And you are not so any longer   No captivity has subdued meI have been here so	51.83278274536133
11625/28840	So longwhen were you arrested then asked the	220.9232177734375
11626/28840	The 28th of February 1815 at halfpast two in the	39.51181411743164
11627/28840	Today is the 30th of July 1816why it is but seventeen	123.39218139648438
11628/28840	You must show me the proofs against	210.2581024169922
11629/28840	Certainly but you will find terrible	123.36659240722656
11630/28840	Monsieur continued Dantès I know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for meyou can have me triedand that is all I	38.25732421875
11631/28840	Let me know my crime and the reason why I was	120.92532348632812
11632/28840	Go on with the lights said the	101.06214141845703
11633/28840	Monsieur cried Dantès I can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me at least to	44.339107513427734
11634/28840	I cannot tell you that replied the inspector I can only promise to examine into your	70.07633209228516
11635/28840	Oh I am freethen I am saved   Who arrested you  	108.2365951538086
11636/28840	See him and hear what he	159.23341369628906
11637/28840	Villefort is no longer at Marseilles he is now at Toul	40.08042907714844
11638/28840	I am no longer surprised at my detention murmured Dantès since my only protector is	59.63425064086914
11639/28840	de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you   None on the contrary he was very kind to	43.11875534057617
11640/28840	I can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you   Entire	83.5009536743164
11641/28840	Dantès fell on his knees and prayed earnest	27.810733795166016
11642/28840	The door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with Dantès	68.95059967041016
11643/28840	0173m       Will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell   Let us visit them all said the	44.85994338989258
11644/28840	If I once went up those	567.6318359375
11645/28840	I should never have the courage to come down	64.88898468017578
11646/28840	Ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this ones display of	127.81179809570312
11647/28840	What is his folly   He fancies he possesses an immense	93.40215301513672
11648/28840	The first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on	224.95143127441406
11649/28840	He is now in his fifth year of captivity he will ask to speak to you in private and offer you five	144.63172912597656
11650/28840	How curiouswhat is his name   The Abbé Far	27.36323356628418
11651/28840	It is here unlock the door Ant	144.72872924804688
11652/28840	The turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the _mad abbé_ as the prisoner was usually	68.4050521850586
11653/28840	In the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered	94.23800659179688
11654/28840	He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus slew	152.1172332763672
11655/28840	He did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons	68.7844009399414
11656/28840	He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round	123.24364471435547
11657/28840	What is it you want said the	32.73097229003906
11658/28840	I monsieur replied the abbé with an air of surpriseI want	16.164871215820312
11659/28840	You do not understand continued the inspector I am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the	84.54839324951172
11660/28840	Oh that is different cried the abbé and we shall understand each other I	30.07978630065918
11661/28840	There now whispered the governor it is just as I told	52.69362258911133
11662/28840	Monsieur continued the prisoner I am the Abbé Faria born at	27.837793350219727
11663/28840	I was for twenty years Cardinal Spadas secretary I was arrested why I know not toward the beginning of the year 1811 since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and French	83.04277801513672
11664/28840	Why from the French government   Because I was arrested at Piombino and I presume that like Milan and Florence Piombino has become the capital of some French	65.20626831054688
11665/28840	Monsieur returned the inspector Providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warm	109.73058319091797
11666/28840	It is the only means of rendering Italy strong happy and	198.1859130859375
11667/28840	Very possibly only I am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain	74.32014465332031
11668/28840	We are coming to the point whispered the	127.61100769042969
11669/28840	It is for that reason I am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change Newtons	60.37384033203125
11670/28840	Could you allow me a few words in	38.16499328613281
11671/28840	What did I tell you said the	30.34444236755371
11672/28840	You knew him returned the inspector with a	58.57191467285156
11673/28840	What you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing Far	44.88068389892578
11674/28840	0175m       But said the abbé I would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five	18.798276901245117
11675/28840	The very sum you named whispered the inspector in his	222.21810913085938
11676/28840	However continued Faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be	54.96049880981445
11677/28840	Unfortunately said the governor I know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not Faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his	54.08614730834961
11678/28840	Of course said he of what else should I speak  	110.4356460571289
11679/28840	Inspector continued the governor I can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five	72.74842834472656
11680/28840	That proves returned the abbé that you are like those of Holy Writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear	162.63839721679688
11681/28840	My dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector keep them until you are	135.07386779785156
11682/28840	The abbés eyes glistened he seized the inspectors	69.45978546142578
11683/28840	But what if I am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death this treasure will be	132.775146484375
11684/28840	Had not government better profit by it I will offer six millions and I will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my	82.47341918945312
11685/28840	On my word said the inspector in a low tone had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad I should believe what he	54.087684631347656
11686/28840	I am not mad replied Faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to	98.24241638183594
11687/28840	The treasure I speak of really exists and I offer to sign an agreement with you in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig and if I deceive you bring me here againI ask no	104.68702697753906
11688/28840	Is the spot far from here   A hundred	84.24909210205078
11689/28840	It is not illplanned said the	66.70982360839844
11690/28840	If all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of	83.73221588134766
11691/28840	The scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbés plan has not even the merit of original	72.9989013671875
11692/28840	Then turning to Faria I inquired if you are well fed said	64.00531005859375
11693/28840	Swear to me replied Faria to free me if what I tell you prove true and I will stay here while you go to the	94.20153045654297
11694/28840	Are you well fed repeated the	146.43264770507812
11695/28840	Monsieur you run no risk for as I told you I will stay here so there is no chance of my	54.129276275634766
11696/28840	You do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatient	72.98320007324219
11697/28840	Nor you to mine cried the abb	34.07666778564453
11698/28840	You will not accept my gold I will keep it for	64.57609558105469
11699/28840	You refuse me my liberty God will give it	372.2160949707031
11700/28840	And the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his	92.01483154296875
11701/28840	0177m       What is he doing there said the	15.329834938049316
11702/28840	Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound	105.26519012451172
11703/28840	The turnkey closed the door behind	156.08746337890625
11704/28840	He was wealthy once perhaps said the	277.540283203125
11705/28840	Or dreamed he was and awoke	764.8235473632812
11706/28840	After all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been	40.08658218383789
11707/28840	So the matter ended for the Abbé Far	29.810821533203125
11708/28840	He remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his	121.31037139892578
11709/28840	Caligula or Nero those treasureseekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed	180.654541015625
11710/28840	But the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor	283.16925048828125
11711/28840	They fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their	477.6870422363281
11712/28840	Formerly they believed themselves sprung from Jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviol	192.9396209716797
11713/28840	It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reapp	125.77559661865234
11714/28840	The very madness of the Abbé Faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual	106.5353775024414
11715/28840	The inspector kept his word with Dantès he examined the register and found the following note concerning him   _Edmond Dantès_   Violent Bonapartist took an active part in the return from El	51.394287109375
11716/28840	The greatest watchfulness and care to be	706.2864990234375
11717/28840	This note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his	98.54949951171875
11718/28840	The inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote _Nothing to be	312.7005310058594
11719/28840	Days and weeks passed away then monthsDantès still waited he at first expected to be freed in a	196.84710693359375
11720/28840	This fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to Paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six	169.0447998046875
11721/28840	Finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and Dantès began to fancy the inspectors visit but a dream an illusion of the	104.82160186767578
11722/28840	At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at	115.98760986328125
11723/28840	He took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them Dantès jail	72.89054870605469
11724/28840	A new governor arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners he learned their numbers	118.69255065917969
11725/28840	This horrible place contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantèshe was now number	113.03369903564453
11726/28840	Number 34 and Number 27   Dantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in	193.4345703125
11727/28840	Unfortunates who ought to begin with God do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliver	183.1490020751953
11728/28840	Dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some	140.62843322753906
11729/28840	He entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing	189.94021606445312
11730/28840	His requests were not granted but he went on asking all the	127.46954345703125
11731/28840	He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was	126.69034576416016
11732/28840	Dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified	52.979530334472656
11733/28840	Often before his captivity Dantès mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and	82.58435821533203
11734/28840	He now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer he sighed for the galleys with the infamous costume the chain and the brand on the	74.11492156982422
11735/28840	The galleyslaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each	58.703857421875
11736/28840	He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abb	85.33145904541016
11737/28840	The jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a	146.3746337890625
11738/28840	Dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to	66.55791473388672
11739/28840	He laid every action of his life before the Almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to God Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against	130.29417419433594
11740/28840	Yet in spite of his earnest prayers Dantès remained a	46.78532409667969
11741/28840	He could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so	250.18106079101562
11742/28840	Nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness No distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a	204.6370849609375
11743/28840	Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the _mene mene tekel upharsin_ of Belshazz	112.22248077392578
11744/28840	He told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of Heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest	113.72386169433594
11745/28840	He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconscious	204.31405639648438
11746/28840	By dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on	213.96823120117188
11747/28840	Once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his	319.23309326171875
11748/28840	This state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will	285.8113708496094
11749/28840	There is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the bottom of which lie darkness and	103.77546691894531
11750/28840	Edmond found some solace in these	344.31488037109375
11751/28840	All his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to	139.32070922851562

11755/28840	Soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of	92.64002990722656
11756/28840	No sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a wornout	190.00852966308594
11757/28840	Two methods of selfdestruction were at his	118.00688171386719
11758/28840	He could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food and die of	143.2233123779297
11759/28840	But the first was repugnant to	33.70664978027344
11760/28840	Dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yardarm he would not die by what seemed an infamous	106.38384246826172
11761/28840	He resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his	144.50411987304688
11762/28840	0185m       Nearly four years had passed away at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of	38.1633186340332
11763/28840	Dantès said I wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to	53.0941047668457
11764/28840	When my morning and evening meals are brought thought he I will cast them out of the window and they will think that I have eaten	134.793212890625
11765/28840	He kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought himat first gayly then with deliberation and at last with	187.3907928466797
11766/28840	Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to	110.67636108398438
11767/28840	Hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy	216.52210998535156
11768/28840	It was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less	152.18878173828125

11770/28840	What unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty Then he raised to his lips the repast that like a voluntary Tantalus he refused himself but he thought of his oath and he would not break	154.71319580078125
11771/28840	He persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the	119.343994140625
11772/28840	The next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously	120.0733871459961
11773/28840	It was the twilight of that mysterious country called Death   Suddenly about nine oclock in the evening Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was	55.77629852294922
11774/28840	So many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual Edmond raised his head and	194.9542999267578
11775/28840	It was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the	152.46449279785156
11776/28840	Although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersliberty It seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the	135.68675231933594
11777/28840	Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated	117.51016235351562
11778/28840	No no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death   Edmond still heard the	86.80903625488281
11779/28840	It lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was	197.58145141601562
11780/28840	Some hours afterwards it began again nearer and more	225.08180236816406
11781/28840	Fortunately he fancied that Dantès was delirious and placing the food on the rickety table he	63.071556091308594
11782/28840	Edmond listened and the sound became more and more	78.09830474853516
11783/28840	There can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his	113.51982879638672
11784/28840	Oh if I were only there to help him   Suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hopethe idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring	109.7157211303711
11785/28840	He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his	165.99093627929688
11786/28840	He turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable	54.56025695800781
11787/28840	He had the resolution to stop with	145.76422119140625
11788/28840	He had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much	166.99522399902344
11789/28840	Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couchhe did not wish to	78.02091979980469
11790/28840	He soon felt that his ideas became again collectedhe could think and strengthen his thoughts by	360.90289306640625
11791/28840	Then he said to himself   I must put this to the test but without compromising	59.4068603515625
11792/28840	If it is a workman I need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume	72.92938232421875
11793/28840	If on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise I make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is	134.23678588867188
11794/28840	Edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound	83.73104858398438
11795/28840	At the first blow the sound ceased as if by	131.663818359375
11796/28840	Edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wallall was silent	145.57896423339844
11797/28840	Full of hope Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself wellnigh	99.45518493652344
11798/28840	The day passed away in utter silencenight came without recurrence of the	458.4687194824219
11799/28840	It is a prisoner said Edmond joy	54.44963073730469
11800/28840	His brain was on fire and life and energy	346.0242919921875
11801/28840	At intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as	116.62187957763672
11802/28840	He moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and	71.69054412841797
11803/28840	Something was at work on the other side of the wall the prisoner had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a ch	59.93234634399414
11804/28840	Encouraged by this discovery Edmond determined to assist the indefatigable lab	177.44857788085938
11805/28840	He began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a	144.47946166992188
11806/28840	He saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solid	137.28355407714844
11807/28840	All his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a	205.535888671875
11808/28840	The bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screwdriver to take them	147.7207489013672
11809/28840	The table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been	150.7799530029297
11810/28840	0189m       Dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the	42.584285736083984
11811/28840	He let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in	224.01451110839844
11812/28840	Dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the	54.19828796386719
11813/28840	The breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite	175.5574493408203
11814/28840	Edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard he pushed back his bed and waited for	92.91466522216797
11815/28840	All night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his	125.36897277832031
11816/28840	Dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken	61.451480865478516
11817/28840	He returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and	290.0863952636719
11818/28840	The prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despond	314.7147216796875
11819/28840	During the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished   This idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the ston	112.16299438476562
11820/28840	The wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbed	345.8971252441406
11821/28840	It was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its	69.0594482421875
11822/28840	Dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too	40.71851348876953
11823/28840	The fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil Dantès paused with anguish on his	92.24058532714844
11824/28840	Was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task Suddenly an idea occurred to himhe smiled and the perspiration dried on his	132.84341430664062
11825/28840	The handle of this saucepan was of iron Dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for	38.13498306274414
11826/28840	0191m       The jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into Dantès plate and Dantès after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every	44.3298454284668
11827/28840	Now when evening came Dantès put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke	53.07078170776367
11828/28840	This time he could not blame Dantè	24.335617065429688
11829/28840	He was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before	65.68482208251953
11830/28840	Then he looked about for something to pour the soup into Dantès entire dinner service consisted of one platethere was no	120.91869354248047
11831/28840	Leave the saucepan said Dantès you can take it away when you bring me my	39.234954833984375
11832/28840	This advice was to the jailers taste as it spared him the necessity of making another	162.41490173339844
11833/28840	A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all went	157.64724731445312
11834/28840	At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in	69.72319793701172
11835/28840	Dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with	46.06141662597656
11836/28840	Then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ce	75.45226287841797
11837/28840	At the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay	80.76589965820312
11838/28840	The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the	73.6837158203125
11839/28840	Well dont you intend to bring me another plate said Dantè	79.81573486328125
11840/28840	No replied the turnkey you destroy	136.38153076171875
11841/28840	First you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be	195.92276000976562
11842/28840	I shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into	174.7714080810547
11843/28840	So for the future I hope you will not be so	32.13901901245117
11844/28840	Dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the cover	15.432504653930664
11845/28840	He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for	118.32404327392578
11846/28840	He had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceedingif his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his	104.61627197265625
11847/28840	All day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of	193.5126190185547
11848/28840	When the hour for his jailers visit arrived Dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed	66.3565902709961
11849/28840	The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fishfor thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of	272.7793273925781
11850/28840	This would have been a method of reckoning time had not Dantès long ceased to do	60.78750228881836
11851/28840	Having poured out the soup the turnkey	169.55224609375
11852/28840	Dantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to	53.96385192871094
11853/28840	He listenedall was silent as it had been for the last three	64.31133270263672
11854/28840	Dantès sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted	42.018672943115234
11855/28840	However he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hours he encountered an	67.63106536865234
11856/28840	The iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface Dantès touched it and found that it was a	101.918701171875
11857/28840	This beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole Dantès had made it was necessary therefore to dig above or under	122.8281021118164
11858/28840	The unhappy young man had not thought of	63.471614837646484

11860/28840	Edmonds hair stood on end and he rose to his	109.19984436035156
11861/28840	Ah said he I hear a human	105.45242309570312
11862/28840	Edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years and a jailer is no man to a prisonerhe is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and	141.68470764160156
11863/28840	In the name of Heaven cried Dantès speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies	43.509124755859375
11864/28840	Who are you   Who are you said the	32.14692306518555
11865/28840	An unhappy prisoner replied Dantès who made no hesitation in	63.911014556884766
11866/28840	Of what country   A	103.60335540771484

11872/28840	Dantès shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in	33.99501419067383
11873/28840	Do not dig any more said the voice only tell me how high up is your excavation   On a level with the	148.94265747070312
11874/28840	How is it concealed   Behind my	177.4127960205078
11875/28840	Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner  	64.18360900878906

11877/28840	And the corridor   On a	105.4596176147461
11878/28840	Oh what is the matter cried Dantè	7.69527006149292
11879/28840	I have made a mistake owing to an error in my	69.7211685180664
11880/28840	I took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where I	278.899169921875
11881/28840	I took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the	92.7789306640625
11882/28840	But then you would be close to the sea   That is what I	34.931678771972656

11888/28840	Oh I am a Christian cried Dantès guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon	55.76698684692383
11889/28840	I swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers but I conjure you do not abandon	64.64874267578125
11890/28840	If you do I swear to you for I have got to the end of my strength that I will dash my brains out against the wall and you will have my death to reproach yourself	38.01612854003906
11891/28840	How old are you Your voice is that of a young	109.62854766845703
11892/28840	I do not know my age for I have not counted the years I have been	46.03061294555664
11893/28840	All I do know is that I was just nineteen when I was arrested the 28th of February 18	35.44257354736328
11894/28840	Not quite twentysix murmured the voice at that age he cannot be a	73.17465209960938
11895/28840	I swear to you again rather than betray you I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces   You have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for I was about to form another plan and leave you but your age reassures	64.23452758789062

11903/28840	It is well returned the voice	305.33551025390625
11904/28840	These few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity Dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the	73.19632720947266
11905/28840	He then gave himself up to his	91.5220718383789

11908/28840	All day Dantès walked up and down his	40.89764404296875
11909/28840	He sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his	46.18508529663086
11910/28840	At the slightest noise he bounded towards the	120.74158477783203
11911/28840	Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made upwhen the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water	89.47505187988281
11912/28840	He would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to	78.80467987060547
11913/28840	It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished	219.02366638183594
11914/28840	Doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said Come are you going mad again   Dantès did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray	48.01555252075195
11915/28840	The jailer went away shaking his	75.36872863769531
11916/28840	Night came Dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him but he was	59.04599380493164
11917/28840	The next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his	72.45313262939453
11918/28840	Is it you said he I am	39.02819061279297
11919/28840	Is your jailer gone   Yes said Dantès he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours before	46.260616302490234
11920/28840	I can work then said the	109.46749877929688
11921/28840	Oh yes yes this instant I entreat	65.5570297241211
11922/28840	Then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his	70.84822845458984
11923/28840	A Learned Italian   Seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired Dantès almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the gr	84.2950668334961
11924/28840	He was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by	309.8822021484375
11925/28840	He had a deepset penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his	180.43629455566406
11926/28840	His thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical	205.78390502929688
11927/28840	Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been	110.85714721679688
11928/28840	The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixtyfive years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of	137.3689422607422
11929/28840	He received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and	142.28775024414062
11930/28840	He thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his	182.21240234375
11931/28840	Let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance hereour future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of	131.8440704345703
11932/28840	Advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight then fitting it into its place he said   You removed this stone very carelessly but I suppose you had no tools to aid	99.80040740966797
11933/28840	Why exclaimed Dantès with astonishment do you possess any   I made myself some and with the exception of a file I have all that are necessarya chisel pincers and	56.662750244140625
11934/28840	0201m       Oh how I should like to see these products of your industry and	46.79231643676758

11936/28840	So saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beech	367.7437438964844
11937/28840	And with what did you contrive to make that inquired Dantè	28.935277938842773
11938/28840	With one of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which I came hither a distance of about fifty	86.185546875
11939/28840	Do not speak so loud young mandont speak so	276.2995910644531
11940/28840	It frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the	272.096923828125
11941/28840	But they believe I am shut up alone	188.58839416503906
11942/28840	I expected as I told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea I have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath	98.7939224243164
11943/28840	My labor is all in vain for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with	151.0394287109375
11944/28840	This adjoins the lower part of the governors apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some lockup cellars where we must necessarily be recapt	234.04190063476562

11946/28840	As the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the	124.48211669921875
11947/28840	The young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both	54.06146240234375
11948/28840	An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying I thought so and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the	96.89532470703125
11949/28840	What was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the	48.187557220458984
11950/28840	Yes said he at length it is	33.42141342163086
11951/28840	This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and	344.70733642578125
11952/28840	Are you quite sure of that  	46.15532684326172
11953/28840	I saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for I was fearful he might also see	101.96075439453125
11954/28840	You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon   Then pursued the young man	128.23208618164062
11955/28840	Then answered the elder prisoner the will of God be done And as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn count	131.15057373046875
11956/28840	Dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with	68.23005676269531
11957/28840	Tell me I entreat of you who and what you are said he at	56.47517013549805
11958/28840	Never have I met with so remarkable a person as	179.46153259277344

11961/28840	Pray let me know who you really are   The stranger smiled a melancholy	100.63166046142578
11962/28840	I am the Abbé Faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this Château dIf since the year 1811 previously to which I had been confined for three years in the fortress of Fenestrel	35.67482376098633
11963/28840	In the year 1811 I was transferred to Piedmont in	41.79599380493164
11964/28840	It was at this period I learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by Napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of Rome even in his	138.35211181640625

11966/28840	Then who reigns in France at this momentNapoleon	138.67218017578125
11967/28840	Yes yes continued he Twill be the same as it was in	101.73182678222656

11969/28840	Then new concessions to the people then a constitution then	442.525390625
11970/28840	Ah my friend said the abbé turning towards Dantès and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to	45.414119720458984
11971/28840	Probably if ever I get out of prison   True replied Faria we are prisoners but I forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and I fancy myself at	117.0531997680664
11972/28840	It was the plan of Alexander	45.186954498291016
11973/28840	but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and Napoleon was unable to complete his	184.75689697265625
11974/28840	And the old man bowed his	82.1540756225586
11975/28840	Dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such	45.63099670410156
11976/28840	Napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of Clement	89.48880004882812
11977/28840	Are you not he asked the priest who here in the Château dIf is generally thought to beill   Mad you mean dont you   I did not like to say so answered Dantès	38.90568542480469
11978/28840	Dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said   Then you abandon all hope of escape   I perceive its utter impossibility and I consider it impious to attempt that which the Almighty evidently does not	66.03154754638672
11979/28840	In the first place I was four years making the tools I possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to	200.66477966308594
11980/28840	No I repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almightys	267.8206787109375
11981/28840	Dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbés	54.55339813232422
11982/28840	The abbé sank upon Edmonds bed while Edmond himself remained	126.88059997558594
11983/28840	Escape had never once occurred to	220.69790649414062
11984/28840	There are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an	122.81643676757812
11985/28840	But the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new	116.7994155883789
11986/28840	Another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in	164.6009063720703
11987/28840	This same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an	163.94151306152344
11988/28840	And is not above fifteen feet from it   About	82.23963928222656
11989/28840	Well then I will tell you what we must	23.087543487548828
11990/28840	We must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a	140.03382873535156
11991/28840	This time you will lay your plans more accurately we shall get out into the gallery you have described kill the sentinel who guards it and make our	159.79742431640625
11992/28840	All we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which I am not deficient in as for patience you have abundantly proved yoursyou shall now see me prove	204.1835479736328
11993/28840	One instant my dear friend replied the abbé it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed and what use I intend making of my	47.47352981567383
11994/28840	As for patience I consider that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the	99.45940399169922
11995/28840	But then young man and I pray of you to give me your full attention then I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the Almighty in trying to set an innocent being at libertyone who had committed no offence and merited not	142.70216369628906
11996/28840	And have your notions changed asked Dantès with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me   No neither do I wish to incur	87.16870880126953
11997/28840	Hitherto I have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not	296.9281311035156
11998/28840	I have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but I cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a	162.3304443359375
11999/28840	A slight movement of surprise escaped Dantè	69.04802703857422
12000/28840	Because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of	126.37105560302734
12001/28840	0209m       Since my imprisonment said Faria I have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on	58.1885871887207
12002/28840	Then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of	173.64109802246094
12003/28840	Let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents itself profit by	211.33802795410156
12004/28840	Ah said Dantès you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage	133.35763549804688
12005/28840	I assure you replied the old man I did not turn to that source for recreation or	78.61495971679688
12006/28840	What did you do then   I wrote or	75.1770248413086
12007/28840	Were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper   Oh no answered the abbé I had none but what I made for	38.65248489379883
12008/28840	You made paper pens and ink  	122.13397216796875

12017/28840	I know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although I believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the diction	136.89932250976562

12021/28840	But the ink said Dantès of what did you make your ink   There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied Faria but it was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this	65.13907623291016
12022/28840	Still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every Sunday and I assure you a better ink cannot be	74.17070770263672
12023/28840	For very important notes for which closer attention is required I pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own	153.64834594726562
12024/28840	And when asked Dantès may I see all this   Whenever you please replied the abb	28.685012817382812
12025/28840	Oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young	79.92214965820312
12026/28840	Follow me then said the abbé as he reentered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by Dantè	17.857070922851562
12027/28840	The floor of the abbés cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the	49.61399841308594
12028/28840	As he entered the chamber of his friend Dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his	80.2442855834961
12029/28840	It is well said the abbé we have some hours before usit is now just a quarter past twelve o	40.16988754272461
12030/28840	Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the	113.26834106445312
12031/28840	Look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abbé and then observe the lines traced on the	72.7148208618164
12032/28840	This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean that it moved and not the	118.2480697631836
12033/28840	A double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly	150.0296173095703
12034/28840	Come said he to the abbé I am anxious to see your	21.083084106445312
12035/28840	0213m       What do you wish to see first asked the abb	15.824090003967285
12036/28840	Oh your great work on the monarchy of Italy   Faria then drew forth from his hidingplace three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of pap	82.24026489257812
12037/28840	There said he there is the work	130.50180053710938
12038/28840	I wrote the word _finis_ at the end of the sixtyeighth strip about a week	57.44135665893555

12041/28840	Now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your	161.55406188964844
12042/28840	Dantès examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into	87.04978942871094
12043/28840	I made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlest	88.55003356933594

12045/28840	As for the ink said Faria I told you how I managed to obtain thatand I only just make it from time to time as I require	68.18855285644531
12046/28840	One thing still puzzles me observed Dantès and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight   I worked at night also replied Far	64.99297332763672

12049/28840	So saying the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illumin	109.13232421875
12050/28840	But how do you procure a light   Oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt	105.86868286132812
12051/28840	And matches   I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily	109.79307556152344
12052/28840	Dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of Farias	41.84739685058594
12053/28840	0215m       You have not seen all yet continued Faria for I did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding	40.75469207763672
12054/28840	Behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twentyfive and thirty feet in	114.82701873779297
12055/28840	Dantès closely and eagerly examined it he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any	154.4153594970703
12056/28840	And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed   Oh no for when I had taken out the thread I required I hemmed the edges over	186.8350372314453
12057/28840	With what   With this needle said the abbé as opening his ragged vestments he showed Dantès a long sharp fishbone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in	118.79174041748047
12058/28840	Nevertheless I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings	177.04737854003906
12059/28840	What are you thinking of asked the abbé smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and	69.03739166259766
12060/28840	I was reflecting in the first place replied Dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have	52.95180130004883
12061/28840	What would you not have accomplished if you had been free   Possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human	92.60328674316406

12063/28840	Some of your words are to me quite empty of	289.5743713378906
12064/28840	You must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you	136.33062744140625
12065/28840	Well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now   I did   You have told me as yet but one of themlet me hear the	58.10055923461914
12066/28840	It was thisthat while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with	130.5235137939453
12067/28840	Your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important	235.04856872558594
12068/28840	It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved	100.57547760009766

12071/28840	Come said the abbé closing his hidingplace and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your	69.54134368896484
12072/28840	From this point everything was a blank to Dantèshe knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been	69.55348205566406
12073/28840	His recital finished the abbé reflected long and earnest	73.74996948242188
12074/28840	Still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wicked	252.2245330810547
12075/28840	From this view of things then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way	120.2367935180664
12076/28840	Now to apply it in your caseto whom could your disappearance have been serviceable   To no one by Heaven I was a very insignificant	164.8116912841797
12077/28840	Do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a	106.42387390136719

12082/28840	Now let us return to your particular	108.8927993774414
12083/28840	You say you were on the point of being made captain of the _Pharaon_  	16.761199951171875
12084/28840	And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl  	55.844581604003906
12085/28840	Now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things But let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the _Pharaon	104.2220230102539
12086/28840	What say you   I cannot believe such was the	72.62826538085938
12087/28840	I was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on	184.14474487304688
12088/28840	There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of illwill towards	113.286865234375
12089/28840	I had quarelled with him some time previously and had even challenged him to fight me but he	165.7769012451172

12091/28840	What rank did he hold on board   He was superc	76.4464340209961
12092/28840	And had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment   Not if the choice had remained with me for I had frequently observed inaccuracies in his	112.36678314208984
12093/28840	Good again Now then tell me was any person present during your last conversation with Captain Leclere   No we were quite	65.57278442382812
12094/28840	Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone   It might for the cabin door was openandstay now I recollectDanglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marsh	79.31549835205078
12095/28840	Thats better cried the abbé now we are on the right	70.55596923828125
12096/28840	Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba  	63.00774002075195
12097/28840	Somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it I think   Yes the grand marshal	113.08452606201172
12098/28840	And what did you do with that letter   Put it into my	58.70526123046875
12099/28840	You had your portfolio with you then Now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter   You are right it was left on	133.40794372558594
12100/28840	Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio  	66.56388092041016
12101/28840	And what did you do with this same letter while returning from PortoFerrajo to the vessel   I carried it in my	49.554100036621094
12102/28840	So that when you went on board the _Pharaon_ everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand  	33.143341064453125
12103/28840	Danglars as well as the rest   Danglars as well as	13.858511924743652
12104/28840	Now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your	236.61740112304688
12105/28840	Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated   Oh yes I read it over three times and the words sank deeply into my	90.21041107177734
12106/28840	This proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his fathers residence or in his cabin on board the _Pharaon	60.90602111816406
12107/28840	The thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole	66.07759857177734
12108/28840	Do you really think so Ah that would indeed be	151.570068359375
12109/28840	How did Danglars usually write   In a handsome running	126.9925765991211
12110/28840	And how was the anonymous letter written   Back	191.7330322265625
12111/28840	It was very boldly written if	545.1035766601562
12112/28840	Stop a bit said the abbé taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the	71.30489349365234
12113/28840	Dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to	39.028812408447266
12114/28840	How very astonishing cried he at	391.8354187011719
12115/28840	Why your writing exactly resembles that of the	451.9690246582031
12116/28840	Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and I have noticed that   What   That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably	95.02288055419922
12117/28840	You have evidently seen and observed	378.58367919921875
12118/28840	Oh yes yes   Now as regards the second	94.09966278076172
12119/28840	Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès   Yes a young man who loved	31.62152671813965
12120/28840	And his name was  	81.01719665527344
12121/28840	That is a Spanish name I think   He was a	63.86967086791992
12122/28840	You imagine him capable of writing the letter   Oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into	136.57383728027344
12123/28840	That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice	108.80030822753906
12124/28840	Besides said Dantès the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to	60.07563781738281
12125/28840	You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone   To no	54.69635772705078
12126/28840	Not even to your mistress   No not even to my betrot	33.7018928527832
12127/28840	I feel quite sure of it	43.52056884765625
12128/28840	Pray was Danglars acquainted with Fernand   Noyes he	84.0185775756836
12129/28840	Now I recollect   What   To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at Père Pamphiles the evening before the day fixed for my	63.510093688964844
12130/28840	Danglars was joking in a friendly way but Fernand looked pale and	72.08145141601562
12131/28840	Were they alone   There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named Caderousse but he was very	59.009708404541016
12132/28840	StaystayHow strange that it should not have occurred to me before Now I remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and	130.1357879638672
12133/28840	Oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed Dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brow	46.56070327758789
12134/28840	Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your friends inquired the abbé with a	55.93327713012695
12135/28840	The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily	401.1123962402344
12136/28840	All we have hitherto done in the matter has been childs	135.66488647460938
12137/28840	If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every	78.014892578125
12138/28840	Pray ask me whatever questions you please for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than I do	213.76560974121094
12139/28840	In the first place then who examined youthe kings attorney his deputy or a magistrate   The	132.44317626953125
12140/28840	Was he young or old   About six or sevenandtwenty years of age I should	52.6668815612793
12141/28840	Old enough to be ambitious but too young to be	96.66542053222656
12142/28840	And how did he treat you   With more of mildness than	114.25386810302734
12143/28840	Did you tell him your whole story   I	48.67100524902344
12144/28840	And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination   He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this	91.72351837158203
12145/28840	He seemed quite overcome by my	289.4759521484375
12146/28840	Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored   He gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any	74.9269790649414
12147/28840	And that   He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated	178.50643920898438
12148/28840	What the accusation   No the	70.17434692382812
12149/28840	Are you sure   I saw it	89.03897857666016
12150/28840	This man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought	219.18788146972656
12151/28840	Upon my word said Dantès you make me	29.762046813964844
12152/28840	Is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles   Yes and remember that twolegged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the	54.67695999145508
12153/28840	With all my heart You tell me he burned the letter   He did saying at the same time You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against	104.4278793334961
12154/28840	This action is somewhat too sublime to be	491.4630432128906
12155/28840	You think so   I am sure of	14.938568115234375
12156/28840	To whom was this letter addressed   To	71.52487182617188
12157/28840	What ails you said he at	75.93392944335938
12158/28840	Do you see that ray of sunlight   I	41.949153900146484
12159/28840	Well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to	54.79090881347656
12160/28840	Poor fellow poor young man And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you   He	152.1687469482422
12161/28840	And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter  	167.88162231445312
12162/28840	And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier  	46.562400817871094
12163/28840	Starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed His father his father   Yes his father replied the abbé his right name was Noirtier de Ville	41.483787536621094
12164/28840	At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure	65.37962341308594
12165/28840	The change that had come over Villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishmentall returned with a stunning force to his	139.683837890625
12166/28840	He cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbés cell to his own and said I must be alone to think over all	62.443077087402344
12167/28840	When he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a	106.58634185791016
12168/28840	During these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn	177.35189819335938
12169/28840	Dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellowsufferer to share his	52.593502044677734
12170/28840	The reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual	204.19309997558594
12171/28840	He was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each Sunday with a small quantity of	189.40542602539062
12172/28840	Now this was a Sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with	49.86238479614258
12173/28840	Dantès followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate	82.29251861572266
12174/28840	Faria bent on him his penetrating	218.24717712402344
12175/28840	I regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information I	197.5213623046875
12176/28840	Because it has instilled a new passion in your heartthat of	167.85079956054688
12177/28840	Let us talk of something else said	53.69462203979492
12178/28840	Again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with Dantès request he began to speak of other	47.50785827636719
12179/28840	The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrow	112.05682373046875
12180/28840	Dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to	90.12953186035156
12181/28840	You must teach me a small part of what you know said Dantès if only to prevent your growing weary of	54.16571044921875
12182/28840	I can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as	157.08395385742188
12183/28840	If you will only agree to my request I promise you never to mention another word about	116.8403549194336
12184/28840	Alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when I have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted you will know as much as I do	114.63636779785156
12185/28840	Now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I	103.82189178466797
12186/28840	Two years exclaimed Dantès do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time   Not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the	99.64866638183594
12187/28840	Memory makes the one philosophy the	240.83631896972656
12188/28840	But cannot one learn philosophy   Philosophy cannot be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into	196.96353149414062
12189/28840	Well then said Dantès What shall you teach me first I am in a hurry to	49.95759201049805
12190/28840	And that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following	117.7748794555664
12191/28840	In strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé Dantès spoke no more of	52.96307373046875
12192/28840	Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of	168.3302764892578
12193/28840	Days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive	840.6754760742188
12194/28840	At the end of a year Dantès was a new	25.002296447753906
12195/28840	Dantès observed however that Faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his	145.0443115234375
12196/28840	Sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his	350.85198974609375
12197/28840	I have already told you answered the abbé that I loathe the idea of shedding	31.565696716308594
12198/28840	And yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of selfpres	95.22126770019531
12199/28840	No matter I could never agree to	139.3313446044922
12200/28840	Still you have thought of it   Incessantly alas cried the abb	33.13421630859375
12201/28840	And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked Dantès	50.72263717651367
12202/28840	I have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond	143.3303680419922
12203/28840	He shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion	77.74932861328125
12204/28840	No no cried the abbé impossible   Dantès endeavored to renew the subject the abbé shook his head in token of disapproval and refused to make any further	33.875633239746094
12205/28840	Are you strong the abbé asked one day of Dantè	32.49143600463867
12206/28840	The young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened	88.39693450927734
12207/28840	And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort   I promise on my	68.33434295654297
12208/28840	Then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into	41.66218948364258
12209/28840	And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work   At least a	114.960205078125
12210/28840	And shall we begin at once   At	90.42910766601562
12211/28840	We have lost a year to no purpose cried Dantè	40.45555114746094
12212/28840	Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abb	36.22892379760742
12213/28840	Tut tut answered the abbé man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever	106.39059448242188
12214/28840	Come let me show you my	93.1242904663086
12215/28840	The abbé then showed Dantès the sketch he had made for their	47.89260482788086
12216/28840	It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dantès with the passage which united	38.53120803833008
12217/28840	The prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbés ladder of	65.68807983398438
12218/28840	Dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to	55.501068115234375
12219/28840	That very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate	228.55296325683594
12220/28840	Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkeys	174.60414123535156
12221/28840	They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his	83.6358871459961
12222/28840	At the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their	93.29313659667969
12223/28840	Dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria who had remained in Edmonds cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their ropeladder call to him in a tone indicative of great	63.335025787353516
12224/28840	Dantès hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hands clenched tightly	43.38589859008789
12225/28840	Gracious heavens exclaimed Dantès what is the matter what has happened   Quick quick returned the abbé listen to what I have to	31.750755310058594
12226/28840	Dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on	92.19503784179688
12227/28840	Tell me I beseech you what ails you cried Dantès letting his chisel fall to the	37.465980529785156
12228/28840	Alas faltered out the abbé all is over with	70.3545913696289
12229/28840	I am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness I can feel that the paroxysm is fast	171.34779357910156
12230/28840	I had a similar attack the year previous to my	276.2348937988281
12231/28840	This malady admits but of one remedy I will tell you what that	83.13477325439453
12232/28840	Go into my cell as quickly as you can draw out one of the feet that support the bed you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there halffilled with a redlooking	71.6100845336914
12233/28840	Bring it to meor ratherno noI may be found here therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to drag myself	188.55215454101562
12234/28840	Thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with	47.30423355102539
12235/28840	I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor gro	86.0648422241211
12236/28840	On the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out	180.23277282714844
12237/28840	Take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated	74.66437530517578
12238/28840	When I become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not beforebe careful about thisforce open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and I may perhaps	191.1103515625
12239/28840	The fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a	191.88980102539062
12240/28840	Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the	291.9988098144531
12241/28840	An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning	177.69972229003906
12242/28840	Dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his	68.43095397949219
12243/28840	At length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to	162.75173950195312
12244/28840	He is saved he is saved cried Dantès in a paroxysm of	23.13115882873535
12245/28840	The sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the	95.76732635498047
12246/28840	Dantès listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jail	46.51499938964844
12247/28840	It was therefore near seven oclock but Edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his	162.84071350097656
12248/28840	The young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his	133.5249786376953
12249/28840	He had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his	38.778804779052734
12250/28840	Faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable	249.43963623046875
12251/28840	I did not expect to see you again said he feebly to Dantè	19.52834701538086
12252/28840	And why not asked the young	47.74294662475586
12253/28840	Did you fancy yourself dying   No I had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight I thought you might have made your	98.18505096435547
12254/28840	The deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dantè	91.17855834960938
12255/28840	Without you Did you really think me capable of that   At least said the abbé I now see how wrong such an opinion would have	43.43014144897461
12256/28840	Alas alas I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this	236.3030548095703
12257/28840	Be of good cheer replied Dantès your strength will	50.70024490356445
12258/28840	And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria and took his	65.16358947753906
12259/28840	The third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for	426.1197509765625
12260/28840	No no cried Dantès you are mistakenyou will not die And your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at	80.86570739746094
12261/28840	We shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite	118.74309539794922
12262/28840	My good Edmond answered the abbé be not	50.52922439575195
12263/28840	The attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a	116.7563705444336
12264/28840	None can fly from a dungeon who cannot	353.854248046875
12265/28840	Well we will waita week a month two months if need beand meanwhile your strength will	394.4955139160156
12266/28840	Everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we	124.39755249023438
12267/28840	As soon as you feel able to swim we will	116.50371551513672
12268/28840	I shall never swim again replied Far	90.1043472290039
12269/28840	This arm is paralyzed not for a time but	221.33782958984375
12270/28840	Lift it and judge if I am	310.6164245605469
12271/28840	The young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and	124.00656127929688
12272/28840	You are convinced now Edmond are you not asked the abb	31.939960479736328
12273/28840	Depend upon it I know what I	119.25139617919922
12274/28840	Since the first attack I experienced of this malady I have continually reflected on	133.64231872558594
12275/28840	Indeed I expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfather died of it in a third	134.52012634277344
12276/28840	The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated Cabanis and he predicted a similar end for	212.568115234375
12277/28840	0233m       The physician may be mistaken exclaimed Dantè	26.091686248779297
12278/28840	And as for your poor arm what difference will that make I can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of	143.2155303955078
12279/28840	My son said the abbé you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty	63.96305465698242
12280/28840	Cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe	199.90057373046875
12281/28840	Here I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my	75.52058410644531
12282/28840	As for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flygoI give you back your	159.46401977539062
12283/28840	Then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old mans head he slowly added By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while you	93.27721405029297
12284/28840	Faria gazed fondly on his nobleminded singlehearted highprincipled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his	123.219970703125
12285/28840	Thanks murmured the invalid extending one	107.37738800048828
12286/28840	You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested	125.52821350097656
12287/28840	But as I cannot and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldiers gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the	100.93985748291016
12288/28840	That would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being	240.45513916015625
12289/28840	Go then and set about this work in which unhappily I can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited	144.47023010253906
12290/28840	I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to	35.694435119628906
12291/28840	Dantès took the hand of the abbé in his and affectionately pressed	23.352807998657227
12292/28840	Faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged	113.8770523071289
12293/28840	The Treasure   When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found Faria seated and looking	86.16956329345703
12294/28840	He did not speak but showed the paper to Dantè	36.39998245239258
12295/28840	Look at it said the abbé with a	14.246820449829102
12296/28840	I have looked at it with all possible attention said Dantès and I only see a halfburnt paper on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of	78.11487579345703
12297/28840	This paper my friend said Faria I may now avow to you since I have the proof of your fidelitythis paper is my treasure of which from this day forth onehalf belongs to	98.78657531738281
12298/28840	The sweat started forth on Dantès	84.44806671142578
12299/28840	Until this day and for how long a timehe had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of	81.31547546386719
12300/28840	With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and Faria had been equally	145.4770965576172
12301/28840	He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few words uttered by Faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental	106.81748962402344
12302/28840	You have indeed a noble nature Edmond and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this	65.1054458618164
12303/28840	No be assured I am not	125.82766723632812
12304/28840	This treasure exists Dantès and if I have not been allowed to possess it you	48.44551467895508
12305/28840	No one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad but you who must know that I am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you	98.32958984375
12306/28840	Alas murmured Edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse There was only this blow	120.42953491210938
12307/28840	Then he said aloud My dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile Tomorrow if you will I will hear your narrative but today I wish to nurse you	113.23880004882812
12308/28840	Besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry	120.74520874023438
12309/28840	On the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance Edmond replied the old	45.99107360839844
12310/28840	This idea was one of vengeance to me and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my	87.43212890625
12311/28840	Edmond turned away his head with a	43.41423797607422
12312/28840	You persist in your incredulity Edmond continued Far	110.77630615234375
12313/28840	Well then read this paper which I have never shown to	103.69275665283203
12314/28840	Tomorrow my dear friend said Edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans	37.33493423461914
12315/28840	I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until	53.677032470703125
12316/28840	Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper	107.68278503417969
12317/28840	I will not irritate him thought Edmond and taking the paper of which half was wantinghaving been burnt no doubt by some accidenthe read   this treasure which may amount to	161.0396728515625
12318/28840	of Roman crowns in the most distant	62.48933410644531
12319/28840	25th April 149     Well said Faria when the young man had finished reading	44.87899398803711
12320/28840	Why replied Dantès I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by	82.77165985107422
12321/28840	Yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every	149.2682342529297
12322/28840	And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning   I am sure I have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this	56.206729888916016
12323/28840	It was the governor who hearing of Farias illness from the jailer had come in person to see	49.041053771972656
12324/28840	Faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with	116.93415069580078
12325/28840	His fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young	200.36685180664062
12326/28840	But fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indis	67.70528411865234
12327/28840	During this time Edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered	57.35746765136719
12328/28840	Faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with	101.84822082519531
12329/28840	Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one	65.97669219970703
12330/28840	Edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to Dantès	38.13797378540039
12331/28840	Here I am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant	96.38249206542969
12332/28840	You thought to escape my munificence but it is in	66.06613159179688
12333/28840	Edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside	56.40877151489258
12334/28840	You know said the abbé that I was the secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada the last of the princes of that	46.38093566894531
12335/28840	I owe to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever	178.62828063964844
12336/28840	He was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and I heard the phrase very often As rich as a Sp	141.52764892578125
12337/28840	But he like public rumor lived on this reputation for wealth his palace was my	560.1096801757812

12340/28840	I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family	491.461669921875
12341/28840	One day when I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the History of the City of	89.83257293701172

12345/28840	By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome especially rich men_this_ was the return the Holy Father looked	318.4249267578125
12346/28840	In the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell	98.84293365478516
12347/28840	There was a third point in view which will appear	245.41827392578125
12348/28840	They were ambitious and Cæsar Borgia soon found purchasers for their	42.55459976196289
12349/28840	The result was that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the spec	90.39215850830078

12351/28840	The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at	100.22480010986328
12352/28840	Then the pope and Cæsar Borgia invited the two cardinals to	37.12155532836914
12353/28840	This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his	92.29875183105469
12354/28840	Cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cup	59.04990768432617
12355/28840	This key was furnished with a small iron pointa negligence on the part of the locks	76.05945587158203
12356/28840	When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next	95.65373229980469
12357/28840	Then there was the ring with the lions head which Cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the	69.93032836914062
12358/28840	The lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twentyfour hours the bite was	155.07858276367188
12359/28840	Cæsar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them but Alexander	78.60057067871094
12360/28840	replied Now as to the worthy cardinals Spada and Rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money	93.43938446044922
12361/28840	Besides you forget Cæsar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or	133.98226928710938
12362/28840	Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to	164.5621337890625
12363/28840	The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near San Pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by	156.90391540527344
12364/28840	Rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating	124.91492462158203
12365/28840	Spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his	303.2412109375
12366/28840	He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find	101.4278335571289
12367/28840	Spada knew what these invitations meant since Christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in Rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message Cæsar wills that you	135.10208129882812
12368/28840	but it was a legate _à latere_ who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope His holiness requests you to dine with	68.09848022460938
12369/28840	Spada set out about two oclock to San Pierdare	209.52227783203125
12370/28840	The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew in full costume and Cæsar Borgia paying him most marked attent	63.07928466796875
12371/28840	Spada turned pale as Cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well	51.89554977416992
12372/28840	They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his	111.09130859375
12373/28840	The nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the	398.33270263671875
12374/28840	It was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popes but	128.37831115722656
12375/28840	Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to	193.63851928710938

12378/28840	Then Cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead	55.57744216918945
12379/28840	The heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that Spada the rich man was really the most miserable of unclesno treasuresunless they were those of science contained in the library and	203.58245849609375
12380/28840	They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruit	121.38066864013672
12381/28840	There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his	75.6722640991211

12395/28840	I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the gen	106.41316986083984

12400/28840	0243m       I awoke as the clock was striking	62.68803787231445
12401/28840	I raised my head I was in utter	151.0583038330078
12402/28840	I rang for a light but as no one came I determined to find one for	107.80793762207031
12403/28840	It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of	127.3519287109375
12404/28840	I took a waxcandle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my matchbox being empty with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the em	93.92546081542969
12405/28840	I felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to	202.83033752441406
12406/28840	But beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended I saw yellowish characters appear on the	194.87994384765625
12407/28840	It was that paper you read this morning read it again Dantès and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected	92.83008575439453
12408/28840	Faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to Dantès who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust        This 25th day of April 1498	54.9891471862793

12416/28840	which treasure I bequeath and leave	172.46481323242188
12417/28840	And now said the abbé read this other paper and he presented to Dantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which Edmond read as	78.09540557861328

12441/28840	It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada and the will so long sought for replied Edmond still incred	83.31303405761719
12442/28840	Yes a thousand times yes   And who completed it as it now is   I	72.51472473144531
12443/28840	Aided by the remaining fragment I guessed the rest measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above	131.3504180908203
12444/28840	Now continued Faria addressing Dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as I do	28.127235412597656
12445/28840	If we ever escape together half this treasure is yours if I die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to	164.06663513183594

12450/28840	2   Impossible said Dantès staggered at the enormous	42.7077522277832
12451/28840	Impossible and why asked the old	118.75260162353516
12452/28840	Edmond thought he was in a dreamhe wavered between incredulity and	237.72286987304688
12453/28840	I have only kept this secret so long from you continued Faria that I might test your character and then surprise	96.68292999267578
12454/28840	Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me th	64.98572540283203
12455/28840	Well Dantès you do not thank me   This treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied Dantès and to you	22.535703659057617
12456/28840	You are my son Dantès exclaimed the old	32.54893493652344
12457/28840	You are the child of my	86.11443328857422
12458/28840	God has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get	46.10703659057617
12459/28840	And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and we	53.18154525756836
12460/28840	The abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo but Dantès knew it and had often passed it situated twentyfive miles from Pianosa between Corsica and the Island of Elba and had once touched	34.96758270263672
12461/28840	This island was always had been and still is completely	594.0029296875
12462/28840	It is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the	89.28160858154297
12463/28840	Dantès drew a plan of the island for Faria and Faria gave Dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the	62.64961242675781
12464/28840	But Dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old	42.60909652709961
12465/28840	However as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was	150.30545043945312
12466/28840	They had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantès had partly filled	119.976318359375
12467/28840	But for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to Edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been	54.562374114990234
12468/28840	Thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their	127.4064712524414
12469/28840	You see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to Faria that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to	62.991790771484375
12470/28840	I have promised to remain forever with you and now I could not break my promise if I	57.57899475097656
12471/28840	The treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this	145.32359313964844
12472/28840	These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced themthis is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and	94.88011932373047
12473/28840	I owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even Cæsar Borgia himself could not deprive me of	58.854286193847656
12474/28840	Thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went	665.0382690429688
12475/28840	Faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of	158.4090118408203
12476/28840	As he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it	137.89883422851562
12477/28840	But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would	122.22905731201172
12478/28840	For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart and Dantès knew it from the first to the last	66.75344848632812
12479/28840	Then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real	125.57167053222656
12480/28840	Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantèsinstructions which were to serve him when he was at	110.15885162353516
12481/28840	In the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least toler	225.50064086914062
12482/28840	They were thus perpetually employedFaria that he might not see himself grow old Dantès for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the	132.29074096679688
12483/28840	So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of	121.01387023925781
12484/28840	But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when Faria was left alone and when Edmond returned to his	74.11559295654297
12485/28840	One night Edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling	293.5394592285156
12486/28840	He opened his eyes upon utter	109.37535858154297

12488/28840	He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his	108.18277740478516
12489/28840	Undoubtedly the call came from Farias	519.3931884765625
12490/28840	Alas murmured Edmond can it be   He moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was	69.21617889404297
12491/28840	By the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken Dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bed	70.40473937988281
12492/28840	His features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first	84.53831481933594
12493/28840	Silence he said or you are	162.5634307861328
12494/28840	We must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight	179.86865234375
12495/28840	It would require years to do again what I have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each	102.73002624511719
12496/28840	Besides be assured my dear Edmond the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of	102.83941650390625
12497/28840	Perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while I have been but a hind	105.0353012084961
12498/28840	You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your	119.59613800048828
12499/28840	At length Providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time I should	117.9613037109375
12500/28840	See he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic dra	99.37999725341797
12501/28840	Quick quick tell me what I must do this time are there any fresh instructions Speak my friend I	129.93785095214844
12502/28840	Oh yes yes exclaimed Dantès and I tell you that I will save you	24.59781837463379
12503/28840	I feel the blood flowing towards my	201.2061309814453
12504/28840	These horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a	113.01973724365234
12505/28840	Oh exclaimed Dantès his heart wrung with	44.07794189453125
12506/28840	Do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to	133.30181884765625
12507/28840	If after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that I do not recover then pour the rest down my	144.25607299804688
12508/28840	Now lift me on my bed for I can no longer support	178.83877563476562
12509/28840	Edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the	38.33362579345703
12510/28840	My son I bless thee   The young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old mans	38.76926803588867
12511/28840	Listen now to what I say in this my dying	152.66099548339844
12512/28840	God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or	381.417236328125
12513/28840	I see it in the depths of the inner	46.426605224609375
12514/28840	My eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much	49.256160736083984
12515/28840	If you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not	69.84715270996094
12516/28840	Hasten to Monte Cristoavail yourself of the fortunefor you have indeed suffered long	176.37588500976562
12517/28840	A violent convulsion attacked the old	136.98074340820312
12518/28840	Dantès raised his head and saw Farias eyes injected with	22.146005630493164
12519/28840	It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the	102.97382354736328
12520/28840	Oh yes yes be assured I shall save you Besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were	87.46002960205078
12521/28840	Do not mistake I suffer less because there is in me less strength to	264.0006408691406
12522/28840	At your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more	191.3494415283203
12523/28840	The crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested	334.3839111328125
12524/28840	Dantès took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened	111.52483367919922
12525/28840	With steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the rest	273.7411804199219
12526/28840	When he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much	174.54637145996094
12527/28840	He waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hourno change took	49.65215301513672
12528/28840	Trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his	113.39875030517578
12529/28840	Then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his	88.12287902832031
12530/28840	It was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the	88.06217193603516
12531/28840	Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of	72.85688018798828
12532/28840	While the struggle between day and night lasted Dantès still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the preeminence he saw that he was alone with a	76.8158950805664
12533/28840	Then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vainthey opened again as soon as	174.2666015625
12534/28840	He extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he	99.9142074584961
12535/28840	It was time for the jailer was	41.22251892089844
12536/28840	On this occasion he began his rounds at Dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to Farias dungeon taking thither breakfast and some	96.31854248046875
12537/28840	Nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had	83.1942138671875
12538/28840	Dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate	25.75600242614746
12539/28840	He therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for	56.80344772338867
12540/28840	Other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of	293.3501281738281
12541/28840	Edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead mans face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the	81.15023803710938
12542/28840	The governor then went out and words of pity fell on Dantès listening ears mingled with brutal	131.0292510986328
12543/28840	Well well said one the madman has gone to look after his	142.25164794921875
12544/28840	Good journey to him   With all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said	96.1265640258789
12545/28840	They may give him the honors of the	62.596134185791016
12546/28840	Edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was	71.44977569580078
12547/28840	The voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the	86.5875015258789
12548/28840	Still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the	66.09379577636719
12549/28840	He remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to	185.909912109375
12550/28840	At the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which	52.562477111816406
12551/28840	It was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other	105.26392364501953
12552/28840	There was a moments silenceit was evident that the doctor was examining the dead	41.9476432800293
12553/28840	The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was	79.25482177734375
12554/28840	Questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made Dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his	89.06483459472656
12555/28840	I am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no	76.00424194335938
12556/28840	Ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty years Ill answer for it without any attempt to	86.63676452636719
12557/28840	Still said the governor I believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that I doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is	85.11563110351562
12558/28840	There was a moment of complete silence during which Dantès still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second	46.42411804199219
12559/28840	You may make your mind easy said the doctor he is	42.42520523071289
12560/28840	You know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple	77.39881134033203
12561/28840	In spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by	201.1715850830078
12562/28840	Let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless	149.8970489501953
12563/28840	This order to heat the irons made Dantès	114.64762115478516
12564/28840	He heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying   Here is the brazier light	132.4987030029297
12565/28840	There was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dantès was listening in	104.4026870727539
12566/28840	The perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he should	62.57762908935547
12567/28840	You see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is	146.09730529785156
12568/28840	The poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his	197.95272827148438
12569/28840	Wasnt his name Faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the	137.6042938232422
12570/28840	0259m       Yes sir and as he said it was an ancient	39.080753326416016
12571/28840	He was too very learned and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure but on that indeed he was intract	133.53695678710938
12572/28840	It is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the	85.72284698486328
12573/28840	You had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abb	43.733497619628906
12574/28840	Never sir replied the jailer never on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me	97.88465881347656
12575/28840	One day too when my wife was ill he gave me a prescription which cured	211.03854370117188
12576/28840	Ah ah said the doctor I did not know that I had a rival but I hope governor that you will show him all proper respect in	67.06442260742188
12577/28840	Yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can	134.69747924804688
12578/28840	Will that satisfy you   Must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turn	118.88887023925781
12579/28840	But make hasteI cannot stay here all	189.56842041015625
12580/28840	Will there be any mass asked one of the	144.89181518554688
12581/28840	The chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to Hyères for a	97.55159759521484
12582/28840	I told him I would attend to the prisoners in his	65.23985290527344
12583/28840	If the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requ	31.368690490722656
12584/28840	Pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he is a church	102.0374984741211
12585/28840	God will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a	211.71395874023438
12586/28840	A shout of laughter followed this brutal j	912.6025390625
12587/28840	Meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going	110.07279205322266
12588/28840	This evening said the governor when the task was	91.6604232788086
12589/28840	Shall we watch by the corpse   Of what use would it be Shut the dungeon as if he were alivethat is	91.36896514892578
12590/28840	Then he raised the flagstone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the	53.35451126098633
12591/28840	It was empty and Dantès emerged from the	34.696937561035156
12592/28840	A barrier had been placed between Dantès and his old	35.35310745239258
12593/28840	No longer could Edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence	121.30926513671875
12594/28840	Faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer	141.8374786376953
12595/28840	He seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy rever	73.03361511230469
12596/28840	If I could die he said I should go where he goes and should assuredly find him	112.79060363769531
12597/28840	But how to die It is very easy he went on with a smile I will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine	61.889705657958984
12598/28840	But excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the	168.71018981933594
12599/28840	Dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and	125.31619262695312
12600/28840	Die oh no he exclaimednot die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much Die yes had I died years ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of	172.573974609375
12601/28840	No I want to live I shall struggle to the very last I will yet win back the happiness of which I have been	109.135498046875
12602/28840	Before I die I must not forget that I have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to	114.33900451660156
12603/28840	Yet they will forget me here and I shall die in my dungeon like Far	59.0787467956543
12604/28840	As he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing	203.45843505859375
12605/28840	Suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the	79.17557525634766
12606/28840	He would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that	69.0363998413086
12607/28840	Dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed	66.65567016601562
12608/28840	In that case his last hope would have been	131.01187133789062
12609/28840	Now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to	130.66163635253906
12610/28840	He hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome	63.26626205444336
12611/28840	If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and thenso much the better all would be	107.02294921875
12612/28840	Dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it	42.35781478881836
12613/28840	His situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but	213.69680786132812
12614/28840	This time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to Dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover	60.830440521240234
12615/28840	When seven oclock came Dantès agony really	103.68103790283203
12616/28840	His hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his	59.21595764160156
12617/28840	From time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of	118.75883483886719
12618/28840	Then he thought he was going to	32.59404754638672
12619/28840	Yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and Dantès knew that he had escaped the first	49.994529724121094
12620/28840	At length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the	125.86385345458984
12621/28840	Edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his	70.34680938720703
12622/28840	The footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand Dantès guessed that the two gravediggers had come to seek himthis idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the handb	107.31812286376953
12623/28840	The door opened and a dim light reached Dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its	70.28776550292969
12624/28840	The two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extrem	148.12265014648438
12625/28840	Hes heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the	210.08511352539062
12626/28840	They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the	250.11175537109375
12627/28840	Have you tied the knot inquired the first	197.91505432128906
12628/28840	What would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply I can do that when we get	76.8596420288086
12629/28840	They deposited the supposed corpse on the b	565.2789916992188
12630/28840	Edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the	78.97817993164062
12631/28840	Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and Dantès knew that the mistral was	68.6273193359375
12632/28840	It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely ming	138.3905792236328
12633/28840	The bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the	140.05760192871094
12634/28840	One of them went away and Dantès heard his shoes striking on the	45.20105743408203
12635/28840	Really he is by no means a light load said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the handbar	100.0795669555664
12636/28840	Dantès first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt	39.31840896606445
12637/28840	Give us a light said the other bearer or I shall never find what I am looking	55.13433837890625
12638/28840	The man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite	258.4674072265625
12639/28840	What can he be looking for thought Ed	108.91793823242188
12640/28840	An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the gravedigger had found the object of his	47.654666900634766
12641/28840	Here it is at last he said not without some trouble	135.47230529785156
12642/28840	Yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by	154.4239044189453
12643/28840	As he said this the man came towards Edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful	92.81087493896484
12644/28840	Well have you tied the knot inquired the gravedigger who was looking	87.31464385986328
12645/28840	Yes and pretty tight too I can tell you was the	123.2872543334961
12646/28840	And the bier was lifted once more and they	204.70831298828125
12647/28840	They advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward	94.74756622314453
12648/28840	The noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the château is built reached Dantès ear distinctly as they went	84.43402099609375
12649/28840	Bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the	159.240478515625
12650/28840	Why yes the abbé runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal	72.89945220947266
12651/28840	Dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his	30.963308334350586
12652/28840	Well here we are at last said one of	62.795265197753906
12653/28840	A little farthera little farther said the	446.0189208984375
12654/28840	You know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless	106.00265502929688
12655/28840	They ascended five or six more steps and then Dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and	49.192256927490234
12656/28840	One said the gravediggers two three   And at the same instant Dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curd	72.2202377319336
12657/28840	Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a	116.613037109375
12658/28840	At last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the icecold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the	94.1355209350586
12659/28840	Dantès had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirtysixpound shot tied to his	40.44404983520508
12660/28840	The sea is the cemetery of the Château d	21.809526443481445
12661/28840	He then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually str	77.5758285522461
12662/28840	With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his	133.4561767578125
12663/28840	Dantès waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being	39.74275588989258
12664/28840	When he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first	52.380027770996094
12665/28840	Behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantomlike the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two	304.4974670410156
12666/28840	He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange gravediggers had heard his	72.19709777832031
12667/28840	Dantès dived again and remained a long time beneath the	49.9493408203125
12668/28840	This was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the	80.88676452636719
12669/28840	When he came up again the light had	114.49394226074219
12670/28840	Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Château dIf but Ratonneau and Pomègue are inhabited as is also the islet of Da	114.87499237060547
12671/28840	Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dantès	160.5332794189453
12672/28840	The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Château dIf Dantès nevertheless determined to make for	38.01213073730469
12673/28840	But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night   At this moment he saw the light of Planier gleaming in front of him like a	43.11787033081055
12674/28840	By leaving this light on the right he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left by turning to the left therefore he would find	90.1322021484375
12675/28840	But as we have said it was at least a league from the Château dIf to this	18.46790313720703
12676/28840	These words rang in Dantès ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his	65.33038330078125
12677/28840	He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a	78.80581665039062
12678/28840	Fear that relentless pursuer clogged Dantès	87.37345123291016
12679/28840	He listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the	81.42469787597656
12680/28840	He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his	143.84182739257812
12681/28840	He swam on still and already the terrible château had disappeared in the	130.5886993408203
12682/28840	He could not see it but he _felt_ its	89.52635192871094
12683/28840	An hour passed during which Dantès excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the	86.45098114013672
12684/28840	Let us see said he I have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if I am not mistaken I must be close to Tiboul	77.6279296875
12685/28840	But what if I were mistaken   A shudder passed over	61.83522033691406
12686/28840	He sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuper	86.24935150146484
12687/28840	Well said he I will swim on until I am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then I shall sink and he struck out with the energy of	94.82095336914062
12688/28840	Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his	81.18212890625
12689/28840	He fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report but he heard	47.80125427246094
12690/28840	Then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the	68.99750518798828
12691/28840	Before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent	104.74974822998047
12692/28840	Dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than	65.07313537597656
12693/28840	Then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter	64.80503845214844
12694/28840	At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of	63.3424186706543
12695/28840	The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic	177.70947265625
12696/28840	Dantès had not been deceivedhe had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact Tiboul	38.3233642578125
12697/28840	He knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to Lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for conceal	199.8729248046875
12698/28840	An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its	148.18121337890625
12699/28840	Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their	206.4142303466797
12700/28840	He was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the	64.28935241699219
12701/28840	It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the	64.5561752319336
12702/28840	He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for fourandtwenty	34.406776428222656
12703/28840	He extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the	95.45148468017578
12704/28840	As he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the	98.82158660888672
12705/28840	By its light between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle a quarter of a league distant Dantès saw a fishingboat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and	97.4354248046875
12706/28840	A second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapid	194.43246459960938
12707/28840	Dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it	42.944278717041016
12708/28840	Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rud	151.54029846191406
12709/28840	The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the	146.94871520996094
12710/28840	Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast seab	214.9477081298828
12711/28840	At the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of	96.94283294677734
12712/28840	Dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless	171.95913696289062
12713/28840	Dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased and the tempest continued to	107.38748168945312
12714/28840	By degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright	216.3544158935547
12715/28840	Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a light played over them and gilded their foaming crests with	139.62411499023438
12716/28840	Dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the Château dIf he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be	46.4981575012207
12717/28840	He turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and	123.9129867553711
12718/28840	The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the	143.38511657714844
12719/28840	In two or three hours thought Dantès the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the	74.18146514892578
12720/28840	Then the tunnel will be discovered the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered will be	117.95185852050781
12721/28840	Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched	899.3480224609375
12722/28840	The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and fam	340.423095703125
12723/28840	The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursues me by	180.284423828125
12724/28840	I have lost even the knife that saved	178.3453826904297
12725/28840	Oh my God I have suffered enough surely Have pity on me and do for me what I am unable to do for	57.05892562866211
12726/28840	She was coming out of Marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the	122.2056884765625
12727/28840	In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps I have not been missed at the	107.25749206542969
12728/28840	I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last	95.18304443359375
12729/28840	My story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict	82.45178985595703
12730/28840	As he spoke Dantès looked toward the spot where the fishingvessel had been wrecked and	64.0678482055664
12731/28840	The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessels keel floated at the foot of the cr	68.3791275024414
12732/28840	In an instant Dantès plan was	61.3218994140625
12733/28840	He swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was	86.15892028808594
12734/28840	He soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the Château dIf and the tower of Plan	48.404632568359375
12735/28840	For an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for Italy between the islands of Jaros and Calaseraign	157.7270965576172
12736/28840	However the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of	94.73351287841797
12737/28840	He rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another	105.68378448486328
12738/28840	Dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his	53.001766204833984
12739/28840	It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vesselcertainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting	133.15150451660156
12740/28840	Dantès though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards	160.731201171875
12741/28840	Then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her	151.64122009277344
12742/28840	By a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to	124.64070129394531
12743/28840	This time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards	80.91504669189453
12744/28840	At the same time he saw they were about to lower the	55.84628677368164
12745/28840	An instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards	177.07574462890625
12746/28840	Dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet	57.33329391479492
12747/28840	But he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to	150.49765014648438
12748/28840	His arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breath	169.57843017578125
12749/28840	The two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in Italian Courage   The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his	96.18782043457031
12750/28840	He rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his	163.2958984375
12751/28840	The water passed over his head and the sky turned	147.6225128173828
12752/28840	A convulsive movement again brought him to the	121.38859558105469
12753/28840	He felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard	161.8990020751953
12754/28840	When he opened his eyes Dantès found himself on the deck of the tart	21.73027992248535
12755/28840	His first care was to see what course they were	186.88929748535156
12756/28840	They were rapidly leaving the Château dIf	28.640100479125977
12757/28840	Dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a	41.52116012573242
12758/28840	As we have said he was lying on the	37.735782623291016
12759/28840	A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elastic	320.08135986328125
12760/28840	Who are you said the pilot in bad	181.12135314941406
12761/28840	I am replied Dantès in bad Italian a Maltese	55.628299713134766
12762/28840	We were coming from Syracuse laden with	259.0719909667969
12763/28840	The storm of last night overtook us at Cape Morgiou and we were wrecked on these	281.34674072265625
12764/28840	Where do you come from   From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all	76.74988555908203
12765/28840	I saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island I swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your	142.50794982910156
12766/28840	You have saved my life and I thank you continued Dantè	25.721410751342773
12767/28840	I was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my	154.4091796875
12768/28840	It was I said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were	106.30965423583984
12769/28840	Yes returned Dantès holding out his hand I thank you	31.641881942749023
12770/28840	I almost hesitated though replied the sailor you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot	247.2161407470703
12771/28840	Dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Château d	24.799543380737305
12772/28840	Yes said he I made a vow to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger but today the vow	117.50590515136719
12773/28840	Now what are we to do with you said the	30.0515079498291
12774/28840	My captain is dead I have barely escaped but I am a good	124.44281768798828
12775/28840	Leave me at the first port you make I shall be sure to find	88.64385986328125
12776/28840	Do you know the Mediterranean   I have sailed over it since my	94.8686294555664
12777/28840	You know the best harbors   There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over my	79.51942443847656
12778/28840	I say captain said the sailor who had cried Courage to Dantès if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us   If he says true said the captain doubting	93.34595489501953
12779/28840	But in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it	218.19847106933594
12780/28840	I will do more than I promise said Dantè	23.76453971862793
12781/28840	We shall see returned the other	153.4408416748047
12782/28840	Then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind   Because we should run straight on to the Island of R	121.59593200683594
12783/28840	You shall pass it by twenty fath	92.09221649169922
12784/28840	Take the helm and let us see what you	32.42387008666992
12785/28840	The young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a firstrate sailor she yet was tolerably	150.11392211914062
12786/28840	The four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked	205.27154541015625
12787/28840	This order was also executed and the vessel passed as Dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to wind	80.75946807861328
12788/28840	And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of	126.29515075683594

12791/28840	Ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are	55.97492599487305
12792/28840	Give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned Dantè	54.3527717590332

12796/28840	Thats true replied Jacopo I only make a	180.2915496826172
12797/28840	Well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have	61.8713493347168
12798/28840	No said Jacopo but I have a shirt and a pair of	39.41810989379883
12799/28840	That is all I want interrupted Dantè	48.332313537597656
12800/28840	Jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what Edmond	136.63381958007812

12807/28840	Hollo whats the matter at the Château dIf said the	40.41477584838867
12808/28840	A small white cloud which had attracted Dantès attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the Château d	29.573444366455078
12809/28840	At the same moment the faint report of a gun was	94.95280456542969
12810/28840	A prisoner has escaped from the Château dIf and they are firing the alarm gun replied Dantè	31.981199264526367
12811/28840	The captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died	115.46452331542969

12813/28840	At any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for I have made a rare	43.32374572753906
12814/28840	Dantès could thus keep his eyes on Marse	33.83171844482422
12815/28840	What is the day of the month asked he of Jacopo who sat down beside	48.02848434448242
12816/28840	I ask you what year is it   The year 1829 returned Jacop	28.659610748291016
12817/28840	It was fourteen years day for day since Dantès	134.08421325683594
12818/28840	He was nineteen when he entered the Château dIf he was thirtythree when he	38.74174880981445
12819/28840	A sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of Mercédès who must believe him	32.80311965942383
12820/28840	Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a	55.09156036376953
12821/28840	He renewed against Danglars Fernand and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his	55.335697174072266
12822/28840	This oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Legh	110.56385040283203
12823/28840	The Smugglers   Dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been	64.48406219482422
12824/28840	It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a smugg	33.30802536010742
12825/28840	At first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of	49.46812438964844
12826/28840	This made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the newcomer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his	100.22503662109375
12827/28840	Thus the Genoese subtle as he was was duped by Edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation	107.4151840209961
12828/28840	Moreover it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should	60.58361053466797
12829/28840	In this state of mutual understanding they reached Legh	107.02039337158203
12830/28840	Here Edmond was to undergo another trial he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen	57.89190673828125
12831/28840	He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had	87.02044677734375
12832/28840	His comrades believed that his vow was	824.7786254882812
12833/28840	As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn he remembered a barber in	81.41332244873047
12834/28840	Ferdinand Street he went there to have his beard and hair	514.957275390625
12835/28840	The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave his head the appearance of one of Titians	105.10909271240234
12836/28840	At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of	150.6245880126953
12837/28840	The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to	107.87483978271484
12838/28840	When the operation was concluded and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a looking	146.986083984375
12839/28840	He was now as we have said threeandthirty years of age and his fourteen years imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his	68.31368255615234
12840/28840	Dantès had entered the Château dIf with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his	76.97360229492188
12841/28840	0283m       To the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular	79.09444427490234
12842/28840	As to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost ho	131.4262237548828
12843/28840	Moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the	161.64405822753906
12844/28840	Edmond smiled when he beheld himself it was impossible that his best friendif indeed he had any friend leftcould recognize him he could not recognize	136.380615234375
12845/28840	The master of _La Jeune Amélie_ who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of Edmonds value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which Edmond had	38.191925048828125
12846/28840	His next care on leaving the barbers who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailors suita garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a	143.9122772216797
12847/28840	Attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to Dantès but Dantès who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three	81.39873504638672
12848/28840	_La Jeune Amélie_ had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as	95.90972137451172

12850/28840	The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties and land it on the shores of Corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to	109.93687438964844
12851/28840	They sailed Edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in	72.59585571289062
12852/28840	He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left and went towards the country of Paoli and	138.0177764892578
12853/28840	The next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found Dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy	144.95594787597656
12854/28840	It was the Island of Monte Crist	12.37205696105957
12855/28840	_La Jeune Amélie_ left it threequarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for Cors	54.634586334228516
12856/28840	Dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised	53.790283203125
12857/28840	But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself Besides what would the sailors say What would the patron think He must	181.23712158203125
12858/28840	Fortunately Dantès had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for	75.94609069824219
12859/28840	Dantès noticed that the captain of _La Jeune Amélie_ had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or	68.27151489257812
12860/28840	But on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and polit	100.10334014892578
12861/28840	The same night such a man of regularity was the patron of _La Jeune Amélie_ the profits were divided and each man had a hundred Tuscan livres or about eighty franc	44.93750762939453
12862/28840	They turned the bowsprit towards Sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been	133.30447387695312
12863/28840	The second operation was as successful as the first _La Jeune Amélie_ was in	23.527462005615234
12864/28840	This new cargo was destined for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca and consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars sherry and Malaga	152.9234161376953
12865/28840	There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of _La Jeune Amélie	43.315914154052734
12866/28840	A customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded Dantès was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left	90.02275848388672
12867/28840	Dantès was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear	138.39764404296875
12868/28840	He had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher Pain thou art not an	183.4117889404297
12869/28840	He had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon	279.75360107421875

12871/28840	Jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted	100.87706756591797
12872/28840	Fortunately as we have said Edmond was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old Sardinian women the wound soon	127.27835083007812
12873/28840	Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prizemoney but Jacopo refused it indign	92.69332122802734
12874/28840	As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond the latter was moved to a certain degree of	65.15402221679688
12875/28840	But this sufficed for Jacopo who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of positiona superiority which Edmond had concealed from all	80.8917007446289
12876/28840	And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave se	75.75811767578125
12877/28840	He pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where God writes in azure with letters of	139.76779174804688
12878/28840	And when Jacopo inquired of him What is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me Edmond replied Who knows You may one day be the captain of a	81.14595031738281
12879/28840	We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Cors	41.06983947753906
12880/28840	He had passed and repassed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing	64.9334716796875
12881/28840	Then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied	72.81217956542969
12882/28840	But in this world we must risk	79.33699035644531
12883/28840	Prison had made Edmond prudent and he was desirous of running no risk	149.88804626464844
12884/28840	But in vain did he rack his imagination fertile as it was he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companions	99.7870864868164
12885/28840	This time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets stuffs of the Levant and cashme	140.28030395507812
12886/28840	It was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of	107.43070983886719
12887/28840	If the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the	126.88634490966797
12888/28840	At the mention of Monte Cristo Dantès started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca	75.79621124267578
12889/28840	When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following	54.0128173828125
12890/28840	Edmond being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done	264.9852600097656
12891/28840	Nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following	136.20106506347656
12892/28840	One night more and he would be on his	69.033935546875
12893/28840	The night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through Dantès	87.93415069580078
12894/28840	If he closed his eyes he saw Cardinal Spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flameif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his	98.33438110351562

12898/28840	All was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it	96.87638854980469
12899/28840	The day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and Dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his	74.95584869384766
12900/28840	Night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal Dantès	88.5522689819336
12901/28840	He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and	113.66997528076172
12902/28840	The old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of Dantès over the crew and	81.01793670654297

12932/28840	For a moment Dantès was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by Cardinal Sp	52.545387268066406
12933/28840	The point was then to discover the hidden	404.95562744140625
12934/28840	It was useless to search at night and Dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the	79.15039825439453
12935/28840	Besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which _La Jeune Amélie_ replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had	58.364044189453125

12937/28840	Fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transit	154.2251434326172
12938/28840	However Jacopo insisted on following him and Dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur	44.762481689453125
12939/28840	Scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a	110.60444641113281
12940/28840	This and some dried fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano was the bill of	184.7458038330078
12941/28840	Dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about	61.813697814941406
12942/28840	Having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom Jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which Edmonds skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital	97.06721496582031
12943/28840	Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his	82.37107849121094
12944/28840	At this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contempt	518.8671875
12945/28840	Yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that I shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost	287.1377868652344
12946/28840	Oh no exclaimed Edmond that will not	63.990325927734375
12947/28840	The wise unerring Faria could not be mistaken in this one	121.0267333984375
12948/28840	Besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched	151.1273956298828
12949/28840	Thus Dantès who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for	152.48550415039062
12950/28840	The cause was not in Dantès but in Providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless	133.3891143798828
12951/28840	Meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod Dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have	111.29411315917969
12952/28840	Keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of	135.3199462890625
12953/28840	Time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite	161.45077514648438
12954/28840	Occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lic	263.300537109375
12955/28840	So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guidemarks	169.40919494628906
12956/28840	The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest	1104.634033203125
12957/28840	Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so	65.41370391845703
12958/28840	This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying	116.76661682128906
12959/28840	A large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to	173.6203155517578
12960/28840	Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his	100.64518737792969
12961/28840	Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the	178.3907012939453
12962/28840	Just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed	77.33550262451172
12963/28840	The sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards	284.0512390136719
12964/28840	But even while they watched his daring progress Edmonds foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and	105.26061248779297
12965/28840	They all rushed towards him for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority yet Jacopo reached him	98.13066864013672
12966/28840	He found Edmond lying prone bleeding and almost	217.8921661376953
12967/28840	He had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen	83.15650177001953
12968/28840	They poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as	104.52033233642578
12969/28840	Edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his lo	165.47308349609375
12970/28840	They wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under Jacopos directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be	85.63350677490234
12971/28840	It may be supposed that Dantès did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their	63.28955841064453
12972/28840	As for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be	70.40701293945312
12973/28840	The sailors did not require much	461.0653076171875
12974/28840	They were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremon	208.13577270507812
12975/28840	All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a mossgrown	63.5442008972168
12976/28840	But instead of growing easier Dantès pains appeared to increase in	131.63424682617188
12977/28840	The old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France between Nice and Fréjus urged Dantès to try and	79.63420867919922
12978/28840	Edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning	118.07334899902344
12979/28840	He has broken his ribs said the commander in a low	65.62643432617188
12980/28840	No matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave	53.39948272705078
12981/28840	We will try and carry him on board the tart	55.003334045410156
12982/28840	Dantès declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost	82.29130554199219
12983/28840	Well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like	84.91743469238281
12984/28840	This very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed	233.05088806152344
12985/28840	The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its	80.06973266601562
12986/28840	Dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his	71.90209197998047
12987/28840	No no he said to the patron I was awkward and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clums	118.91943359375
12988/28840	Leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for	128.19093322753906
12989/28840	But youll die of hunger said the	123.7021713256836
12990/28840	I would rather do so was Edmonds reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes	139.45184326171875
12991/28840	The patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be	197.33062744140625
12992/28840	What are we to do Maltese asked the	67.25827026367188
12993/28840	We cannot leave you here so and yet we cannot	146.45297241210938
12994/28840	We shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up	67.259521484375
12995/28840	Why said Dantès if in two or three days you hail any fishingboat desire them to come here to	56.338260650634766
12996/28840	I will pay twentyfive piastres for my passage back to Legh	50.54192352294922
12997/28840	If you do not come across one return for	91.4920883178711
12998/28840	Listen Captain Baldi theres one way of settling this said Jacop	211.87301635742188
12999/28840	Do you go and I will stay and take care of the wounded	33.519691467285156
13000/28840	And give up your share of the venture said Edmond to remain with me   Yes said Jacopo and without any	57.29440689086914
13001/28840	You are a good fellow and a kindhearted messmate replied Edmond and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions but I do not wish anyone to stay with	59.16935348510742
13002/28840	A day or two of rest will set me up and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for	201.94923400878906
13003/28840	A peculiar smile passed over Dantès lips he squeezed Jacopos hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remainand remain	162.6262969970703
13004/28840	The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which Edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his	96.25109100341797
13005/28840	Then when they had disappeared he said with a smileTis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and	104.4295654296875
13006/28840	At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he	38.693626403808594
13007/28840	Then Dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted	74.1212158203125
13008/28840	The Secret Cave   The sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the	159.11788940429688
13009/28840	Thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the	172.0976104736328
13010/28840	At every step that Edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to cr	111.0625991821289
13011/28840	In a word the island was inhabited yet Edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of	102.89239501953125
13012/28840	He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dreadthat dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and	176.53860473632812
13013/28840	This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every	73.76678466796875
13014/28840	It was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that Edmond fixed his	50.318153381347656
13015/28840	The first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the Island of Cors	142.337890625
13016/28840	He then looked at the objects near	110.07431030273438
13017/28840	He saw that he was on the highest point of the islanda statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of	106.63422393798828
13018/28840	Then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in	145.2791748046875
13019/28840	Dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient n	61.133731842041016
13020/28840	This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from	119.08229064941406
13021/28840	It was this idea that had brought Dantès back to the circular	52.81852340698242
13022/28840	One thing only perplexed Edmond and destroyed his	276.40185546875
13023/28840	How could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot without the aid of many men   Suddenly an idea flashed across his	136.78616333007812
13024/28840	Instead of raising it thought he they have lowered	247.76417541503906
13025/28840	And he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly	93.9552001953125
13026/28840	He soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now	160.0589141845703
13027/28840	0301m       Dantès dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious art	74.13096618652344
13028/28840	He attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pick	76.34883880615234
13029/28840	After ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was	201.46035766601562
13030/28840	Dantès went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a	103.90489959716797
13031/28840	But the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he Hercules	264.7507019042969
13032/28840	Dantès saw that he must attack the	34.505863189697266
13033/28840	But how   He cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend Jacopo had left	41.62578201293945
13034/28840	He smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this	118.75436401367188
13035/28840	With the aid of his pickaxe Dantès after the manner of a laborsaving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpet	81.78215026855469
13036/28840	Dantès approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the	99.03390502929688
13037/28840	The intrepid treasureseeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the	134.82322692871094
13038/28840	The rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its	350.9015197753906
13039/28840	Dantès redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient Titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the	55.38239669799805
13040/28840	The rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the	420.2605895996094
13041/28840	On the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flag	296.98858642578125
13042/28840	Dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect	45.104591369628906
13043/28840	He would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to	88.72974395751953
13044/28840	This feeling lasted but for a	146.80416870117188
13045/28840	Edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flagstone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous gro	132.88890075683594
13046/28840	Anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of	122.63819122314453
13047/28840	Come said he to himself be a	48.22370529174805
13048/28840	I must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been	43.100128173828125
13049/28840	What then would be the use of all I have suffered The heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions	117.22048950195312
13050/28840	He remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his	41.08588409423828
13051/28840	Now that I expect nothing now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of	131.7196502685547
13052/28840	And he remained again motionless and	167.03878784179688
13053/28840	Yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal band	122.42481231689453
13054/28840	This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvel	286.9497375488281
13055/28840	0303m       But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked Dantès of	31.598270416259766
13056/28840	The fate replied he smiling of those who buried Alaric and were interred with the	285.5604553222656
13057/28840	Yet had he come thought Dantès he would have found the treasure and Borgia he who compared Italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this	116.9831771850586
13058/28840	Alas said Edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious	149.32803344726562
13059/28840	But he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by	100.65828704833984
13060/28840	In the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinals	68.20006561279297
13061/28840	He had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the	59.81657791137695
13062/28840	He reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautions	135.5877227783203
13063/28840	The pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dantès forehead large drops of pers	60.63337707519531
13064/28840	At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must	90.6518783569336
13065/28840	He again struck it and with greater	173.9746856689453
13066/28840	As he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white	198.4322509765625
13067/28840	The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate	222.5855712890625
13068/28840	Dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interst	41.783119201660156
13069/28840	But by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that Faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over	138.3025665283203
13070/28840	The island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue	94.36602783203125
13071/28840	Dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the	64.97856140136719
13072/28840	The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the	118.03602600097656
13073/28840	He had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by	81.35421752929688
13074/28840	The aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of	255.16798400878906
13075/28840	At last after renewed hesitation Dantès entered the second gro	76.25424194335938
13076/28840	The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer	113.39598083496094
13077/28840	He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went	164.46218872070312
13078/28840	At the left of the opening was a dark and deep	113.52057647705078
13079/28840	But to Dantès eye there was no	34.64796447753906
13080/28840	He glanced around this second grotto it was like the first	112.24239349365234
13081/28840	The treasure if it existed was buried in this	243.47091674804688
13082/28840	The time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and Dantès fate would be	85.59414672851562
13083/28840	He advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pick	84.10086822509766
13084/28840	At the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron	282.0550231933594
13085/28840	Never did funeral knell never did alarmbell produce a greater effect on the he	688.1856079101562
13086/28840	Had Dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly	32.008880615234375
13087/28840	He again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same	83.68698120117188
13088/28840	It is a casket of wood bound with iron thought	130.56216430664062
13089/28840	At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening Dantès seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the	60.8643913269043
13090/28840	A wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little	74.34562683105469
13091/28840	This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but Dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract	63.532691955566406
13092/28840	He thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this	190.9879150390625
13093/28840	He approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and	143.5919647216797
13094/28840	He planted his torch in the ground and resumed his	163.91453552246094

13096/28840	Dantès easily recognized them Faria had so often drawn them for	54.195472717285156
13097/28840	There was no longer any doubt the treasure was thereno one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty c	71.7579574584961
13098/28840	In an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as things were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals	123.09740447998047
13099/28840	Dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was	34.572792053222656
13100/28840	He sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their	297.161376953125
13101/28840	Dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fasten	73.10455322265625
13102/28840	The hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was	126.7296142578125
13103/28840	0307m       Edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside	58.12009048461914
13104/28840	He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he reopened them and stood motionless with amaz	82.30029296875
13105/28840	After having touched felt examined these treasures Edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the	136.5076904296875
13106/28840	This time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to God	40.050846099853516
13107/28840	He soon became calmer and more happy for only now did he begin to realize his fel	187.8937530517578
13108/28840	He then set himself to work to count his	254.5990753173828
13109/28840	There were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds then he piled up twentyfive thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money and bearing the effigies of Alexander	102.70758819580078
13110/28840	and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half	99.76215362548828

13112/28840	Dantès saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his	70.82992553710938
13113/28840	A piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the	74.3615493774414
13114/28840	It was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his	83.053466796875
13115/28840	The Unknown   Day for which Dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawn	102.30033874511719
13116/28840	With the first light Dantès resumed his	51.044219970703125
13117/28840	This done he impatiently awaited the return of his	126.27497863769531
13118/28840	On the sixth day the smugglers	673.6046142578125
13119/28840	He then inquired how they had fared in their	172.27684020996094
13120/28840	To this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guardship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail towards	146.62332153320312
13121/28840	This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of Dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so	81.19676971435547
13122/28840	In fact the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when fortunately night came on and enabled them to double the Cape of Corsica and so elude all further	224.77525329589844
13123/28840	Arrived at Leghorn he repaired to the house of a Jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs	106.22239685058594
13124/28840	Dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per	125.98538208007812
13125/28840	The superior education of Dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its	96.46434020996094
13126/28840	The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles with directions from Dantès to join him at the Island of Monte Crist	35.41059875488281
13127/28840	To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future	56.2410774230957
13128/28840	Dantès struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate	54.6508674621582
13129/28840	The builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day Dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be	104.16777038574219
13130/28840	0313m       Two hours afterward Dantès sailed from the port of Genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own	67.75149536132812
13131/28840	But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dantès handled the	113.77354431152344
13132/28840	The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable	201.20986938476562
13133/28840	Some insisted she was making for Corsica others the Island of Elba bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for Spain while Africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course but no one thought of Monte Crist	123.81825256347656
13134/28840	Yet thither it was that Dantès guided his vessel and at Monte Cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself a firstclass sailor and had come the distance from Genoa in thirtyfive	72.81999969482422
13135/28840	Dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little	66.48058319091797
13136/28840	The island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left	106.566162109375
13137/28840	Early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret	85.60920715332031
13138/28840	The former Dantès proposed to augment the latter to	78.6572265625
13139/28840	Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching Monte Crist	150.25778198242188
13140/28840	As it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to Jacop	65.0885238647461
13141/28840	His signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the newcomer lay at anchor beside the	129.76443481445312
13142/28840	A mournful answer awaited each of Edmonds eager inquiries as to the information Jacopo had	167.4490203857422
13143/28840	Old Dantès was dead and Mercédès had	11.197410583496094
13144/28840	Dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite	65.77433776855469

13147/28840	For his fathers death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of Mercédè	43.84567642211914
13148/28840	Without divulging his secret Dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an	127.61946105957031
13149/28840	There were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to	91.64045715332031
13150/28840	His lookingglass had assured him during his stay at Leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought	132.35635375976562
13151/28840	The first person to attract the attention of Dantès as he landed on the Canebière was one of the crew belonging to the _Pharaon	23.35407257080078
13152/28840	Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellowwho had been one of his own sailorsas a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own	157.19761657714844
13153/28840	Going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then convers	96.80928802490234
13154/28840	Giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility Dantès proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to	73.6697998046875
13155/28840	I beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but I believe you made a mistake you intended to give me a twofranc piece and see you gave me a double	91.66895294189453
13156/28840	I see that I have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another double Napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join	64.9491958618164
13157/28840	So extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank Edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless aston	141.9033660888672
13158/28840	Some nabob from India was his	372.8271789550781
13159/28840	Each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion his first and most indelible recollections were there not a tree not a street that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished	233.20327758789062
13160/28840	And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles from whence a full view of the Allées de Meilhan was	33.52949523925781
13161/28840	Recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had	56.29835891723633
13162/28840	The nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the	68.61248779296875
13163/28840	Leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little	143.49203491210938
13164/28840	Then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be	89.38465118408203
13165/28840	The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them Dantès sighed	96.13806915283203
13166/28840	0317m       When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to	88.57140350341797
13167/28840	The very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of Dantès were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds	66.3739013671875
13168/28840	that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present	169.29994201660156
13169/28840	This strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the Allées de Meilhan and a multitude of theories were afloat none of which was anywhere near the	75.80032348632812
13170/28840	But on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishingboat with two seines and a	198.6785125732422
13171/28840	This modern place of entertainment stood on the lefthand side of the post road and backed upon the Rhô	184.4872589111328
13172/28840	It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of	138.21246337890625
13173/28840	A few dingy olives and stunted figtrees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the	341.12310791015625

13175/28840	Each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper which regaled the passersby through this Egyptian scene with its strident monotonous	241.66343688964844

13181/28840	0323m       Like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to	114.13053894042969
13182/28840	During the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the	178.3134002685547
13183/28840	At the moment Caderousse quitted his sentrylike watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at	105.53617858886719
13184/28840	The horse was of Hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy	282.10479736328125
13185/28840	His rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a threecornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapid	124.70513916015625
13186/28840	Having arrived before the Pont du Gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to	98.96422576904297
13187/28840	However that might have been the priest dismounting led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure	45.49625778198242
13188/28840	At this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to	183.4730224609375
13189/28840	At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to	107.48953247070312
13190/28840	0319m       You are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished Cader	32.37516784667969

13192/28840	I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot	118.706298828125
13193/28840	Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain Caderousse hastily exclaimed A thousand pardons I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor	74.83853149414062
13194/28840	What would the abbé please to have What refreshment can I offer All I have is at his	162.1035614013672
13195/28840	Caderousse   Yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it I am Gaspard Caderousse at your	40.000335693359375

13198/28840	It is so hot at Marseilles that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing	191.92063903808594
13199/28840	But talking of heat is there nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment   Yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left	84.15626525878906
13200/28840	Are you quite alone inquired the guest as Caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a	72.75016784667969
13201/28840	Ah sir said Caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive I am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being	43.152103424072266

13204/28840	Such words as those belong to your profession answered Caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one ple	82.1104507446289
13205/28840	You are wrong to speak thus said the abbé and perhaps I may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in	40.152774810791016
13206/28840	What mean you inquired Caderousse with a look of	31.91497802734375
13207/28840	In the first place I must be satisfied that you are the person I am in search	33.044368743896484
13208/28840	You remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Ed	62.963653564453125
13209/28840	Said to bear the name repeated Caderousse becoming excited and	172.07028198242188
13210/28840	A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his	42.043094635009766
13211/28840	Well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked	128.4951629638672
13212/28840	Ah continued Caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the South the world grows worse and	112.15828704833984
13213/28840	And so I did replied Caderousse though once I confess I envied him his good	134.75086975097656
13214/28840	But I swear to you sir I swear to you by everything a man holds dear I have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy	119.44419860839844
13215/28840	There was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the inn	57.58723068237305
13216/28840	You knew the poor lad then continued Cader	78.01429748535156
13217/28840	I was called to see him on his dying bed that I might administer to him the consolations of	88.97386932373047
13218/28840	And of what did he die asked Caderousse in a choking	35.15095901489258
13219/28840	Of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his	114.70804595947266
13220/28840	How should he have been otherwise Ah sir the poor fellow told you the	177.9408721923828
13221/28840	And for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on	103.65672302246094
13222/28840	And here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with illconcealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Cader	61.007232666015625
13223/28840	Then I suppose asked Caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value   Why everything is relative answered the abb	66.75507354736328
13224/28840	To one in Edmonds position the diamond certainly was of great	181.37518310546875
13225/28840	It was estimated at fifty thousand franc	51.644073486328125
13226/28840	Bless me exclaimed Caderousse fifty thousand francs Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all	82.00907135009766
13227/28840	No replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for	36.03238296508789
13228/28840	The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priests garments as though hoping to discover the location of the	109.25286865234375
13229/28840	Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable work	93.14044952392578
13230/28840	But how comes the diamond in your possession sir Did Edmond make you his heir   No merely his testamentary execut	162.9779815673828
13231/28840	I once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed he said and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my	156.0262908935547
13232/28840	The name of one of the four friends is Cader	27.833166122436523
13233/28840	Another of the number continued the abbé without seeming to notice the emotion of Caderousse is called Danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for	46.61623001098633
13234/28840	A fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbés speech when the latter waving his hand said Allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so	72.9239273071289
13235/28840	The third of my friends although my rival was much attached to mehis name was Fernand that of my betrothed wasStay stay continued the abbé I have forgotten what he called	76.7623291015625
13236/28840	True said the abbé with a stifled sigh Mercédès it	12.440428733825684
13237/28840	Bring me a _carafe_ of water said the abb	32.29347610473633
13238/28840	You will go to Marseilles said Dantèsfor you understand I repeat his words just as he uttered	52.0366325378418
13239/28840	You will sell this diamond you will divide the money into five equal parts and give an equal portion to these good friends the only persons who have loved me upon	204.76319885253906
13240/28840	But why into five parts asked Caderousse you only mentioned four	195.7256317138672
13241/28840	Because the fifth is dead as I	211.26708984375
13242/28840	The fifth sharer in Edmonds bequest was his own	501.93902587890625
13243/28840	Too true too true ejaculated Caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did	87.73863983154297
13244/28840	I learned so much at Marseilles replied the abbé making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder Dantès I was unable to obtain any particulars of his	47.88859558105469
13245/28840	Can you enlighten me on that point   I do not know who could if I could not said Cader	38.70395278930664
13246/28840	Why I lived almost on the same floor with the poor old	68.20995330810547
13247/28840	Ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man	98.35842895507812
13248/28840	Of what did he die   Why the doctors called his complaint gastroenteritis I believe his acquaintances say he died of grief but I who saw him in his dying moments I say he died of   Caderousse	91.7382583618164
13249/28840	Of what asked the priest anxiously and	162.64476013183594
13250/28840	Starvation exclaimed the abbé springing from his	54.61387634277344
13251/28840	Why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as	191.58975219726562
13252/28840	Oh it is impossibleutterly impossible   What I have said I have said answered Cader	27.782203674316406
13253/28840	And you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the	52.55601119995117
13254/28840	Mind your own business wife replied Caderousse	125.2963638305664
13255/28840	This gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to	162.81874084472656
13256/28840	What have you to do with politeness I should like to know Better study a little common prud	78.7408676147461
13257/28840	Ah thats all very fine retorted the	184.23486328125
13258/28840	Nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy I beg of	190.2197265625
13259/28840	Whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that I solemnly promise	125.18737030029297
13260/28840	La Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they	86.96320343017578
13261/28840	Again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower	93.86890411376953
13262/28840	When he had sufficiently recovered himself he said It appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by	139.54025268554688
13263/28840	Surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a	119.81217956542969
13264/28840	And was he not so asked the abb	28.954343795776367
13265/28840	Poor Edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his	69.7734146118164
13266/28840	And whatever people may say continued Caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry I cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the	90.1447982788086
13267/28840	Do you then know in what manner Fernand injured Dantès inquired the abbé of Cader	38.56804656982422
13268/28840	Speak out then say what it was   Gaspard cried La Carconte do as you will you are masterbut if you take my advice youll hold your	83.38059997558594
13269/28840	Well wife replied Caderousse I dont know but what youre right   So you will say nothing asked the abb	29.45047950744629
13270/28840	Why what good would it do asked Cader	130.05860900878906
13271/28840	If the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps I should not	142.17001342773438
13272/28840	But you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with	108.78137969970703
13273/28840	You prefer then said the abbé that I should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship   That is true enough returned Cader	90.464599609375
13274/28840	You say truly the gift of poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars besides what would it be to them no more than a drop of water in the	64.95155334472656
13275/28840	Remember chimed in La Carconte those two could crush you at a single blow   How so inquired the abb	66.53900146484375
13276/28840	Are these persons then so rich and powerful   Do you not know their history   I do	43.53788757324219
13277/28840	Pray relate it to me   Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said No truly it would take up too much	78.371337890625
13278/28840	I shall do my duty as conscientiously as I can and fulfil my promise to the dying	42.30052947998047
13279/28840	My first business will be to dispose of this	109.34917449951172
13280/28840	So saying the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Cader	54.941524505615234
13281/28840	It is a beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dantès to be sold and the money divided between his father Mercédès his betrothed bride Fernand Danglars and	39.10662078857422
13282/28840	The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand franc	73.78448486328125
13283/28840	Oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished	348.63775634765625
13284/28840	The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked Cader	123.9650650024414
13285/28840	It does replied the abbé with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder Dantès which I believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four	59.99496841430664
13286/28840	And why among us four inquired Cader	159.60369873046875
13287/28840	As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to	178.0872039794922
13288/28840	I dont call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering	121.61042785644531
13289/28840	Of course not rejoined Caderousse quickly no more do I and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just	99.82881927490234
13290/28840	I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps	296.0094909667969
13291/28840	Remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that I do	50.10543441772461
13292/28840	You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars in order that I may execute Edmonds last	49.37827682495117
13293/28840	The agitation of Caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated	90.18976593017578
13294/28840	As he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey Caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep	50.87548065185547
13295/28840	For my part I wash my hands of the	148.3170928955078
13296/28840	So saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the	93.1066665649414
13297/28840	Arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband Gaspard consider well what you are about to do   I have both reflected and decided answered	73.75352478027344
13298/28840	La Carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though	121.2283706665039
13299/28840	Well asked the abbé as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do   To tell you all I know was the	34.14698028564453
13300/28840	I certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the	171.71864318847656
13301/28840	Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance I could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is	78.09517669677734
13302/28840	I hope it may be so replied Caderousse his face flushed with cup	32.423095703125
13303/28840	I am all attention said the abb	18.605670928955078
13304/28840	Stop a minute answered Caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to	63.70709228515625
13305/28840	With these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at	83.8641128540039
13306/28840	During this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his	47.49764633178711
13307/28840	Remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of La Carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting	73.53665161132812
13308/28840	Enough enough replied Caderousse say no more about it I will take all the consequences upon	68.57209777832031
13309/28840	The Story   First sir said Caderousse you must make me a	45.30330276489258
13310/28840	Make yourself easy my friend replied the abb	35.915992736816406
13311/28840	I am a priest and confessions die in my	79.96380615234375
13312/28840	Recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our	105.94847869873047
13313/28840	This positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little	169.37632751464844
13314/28840	Well then under these circumstances said Caderousse I will I even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor Edmond thought so sincere and unquestion	110.34758758544922
13315/28840	Begin with his father if you	57.08750534057617
13316/28840	said the abbé Edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest	37.18933868408203
13317/28840	The history is a sad one sir said Caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it  	40.390342712402344
13318/28840	answered the abbé Edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marse	41.583473205566406
13319/28840	At La Réserve Oh yes I can see it all before me this	39.25114059448242
13320/28840	Was it not his betrothal feast   It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and Dantès was	57.62681579589844
13321/28840	Yes and up to this point I know all said the	101.14795684814453
13322/28840	Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you or heard mention of anyone of	119.73873901367188
13323/28840	Well when Dantès was arrested Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very	28.107179641723633
13324/28840	The next day Mercédès came to implore the protection of	36.8348388671875
13325/28840	But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abb	32.18972396850586
13326/28840	Ah sir replied Caderousse we cannot console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these besides I know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing	52.104713439941406
13327/28840	One night however I heard his sobs and I could not resist my desire to go up to him but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but	67.58915710449219
13328/28840	From day to day he lived on alone and more and more	278.01263427734375
13329/28840	Morrel and Mercédès came to see him but his door was closed and although I was certain he was at home he would not make any	37.57086944580078
13330/28840	At length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out he begged for another week which was granted to	104.53508758544922
13331/28840	I know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left	93.77379608154297
13332/28840	For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth I heard	105.00840759277344
13333/28840	I then resolved to go up to him at all	43.1851921081543
13334/28840	The door was closed but I looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill I went and told	106.07672882080078
13335/28840	Morrel and then ran on to Mercédè	43.730224609375
13336/28840	Morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited	206.51446533203125
13337/28840	I was there too and I never shall forget the old mans smile at this	95.46126556396484
13338/28840	From that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the doctor had put him on a	84.970703125
13339/28840	The abbé uttered a kind of gro	32.993473052978516
13340/28840	The story interests you does it not sir inquired Cader	92.29161834716797
13341/28840	Yes replied the abbé it is very	18.349916458129883
13342/28840	Mercédès came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own	61.395511627197266
13343/28840	Morrels wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually	129.9449920654297
13344/28840	Mercédès remained therefore by his bedside and	36.75253677368164
13345/28840	The abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched	122.61211395263672
13346/28840	And you believe he died   Of hunger sir of hunger said Cader	52.15384292602539
13347/28840	I am as certain of it as that we two are	157.7872772216797
13348/28840	The abbé with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him halffull swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale	84.46115112304688
13349/28840	This was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse	38.21168899536133
13350/28840	The more so sir as it was mens and not Gods	151.3443145751953
13351/28840	Tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me	66.14124298095703
13352/28840	Tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine   Two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambitionFernand and Dangl	84.39549255371094
13353/28840	How was this jealousy manifested Speak	696.7843017578125
13354/28840	They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist	43.593624114990234
13355/28840	Which of the two denounced him Which was the real delinquent   Both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the	86.0826187133789
13356/28840	And where was this letter written   At La Réserve the day before the betrothal	27.26535415649414
13357/28840	Twas so thentwas so then murmured the abb	129.02342224121094
13358/28840	Oh Faria Faria how well did you judge men and things   What did you please to say sir asked Cader	54.614524841308594
13359/28840	Nothing nothing replied the priest go	235.5204315185547
13360/28840	It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and Fernand who put it in the	45.23457717895508
13361/28840	But exclaimed the abbé suddenly you were there	74.0583267211914

13363/28840	True true said Caderousse in a choking voice I was	35.785423278808594

13365/28840	Sir replied Caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that I nearly lost all	73.58999633789062
13366/28840	I had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around	92.71723175048828
13367/28840	I said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly	80.09458923339844

13373/28840	Yes sir answered Caderousse and remorse preys on me night and	121.47110748291016
13374/28840	I often ask pardon of God I swear to you because this action the only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject	81.15565490722656
13375/28840	I am expiating a moment of selfishness and so I always say to La Carconte when she complains Hold your tongue woman it is the will of	65.38532257080078
13376/28840	And Caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real	83.50191497802734
13377/28840	Well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve	53.40705871582031
13378/28840	Unfortunately Edmond is dead and has not pardoned	40.88699722290039
13379/28840	He did not know said the abb	11.209144592285156

13381/28840	There was a brief silence the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his	35.729087829589844
13382/28840	You have two or three times mentioned a	116.672607421875

13389/28840	In that case replied the abbé he should be a man blessed of God rich	66.778564453125

13391/28840	How   Yes continued Caderousse so it is after fiveandtwenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of Marseilles	48.01105499267578
13392/28840	If this ship founders like the others he is a ruined	94.27032470703125

13395/28840	And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added Cader	181.23997497558594

13397/28840	What has become of Danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty   What has become of him Why he left Marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of	45.364479064941406

13400/28840	Ah said the abbé in a peculiar tone he is	37.900875091552734
13401/28840	Happy Who can answer for that Happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to ones self and the wallswalls have ears but no tongue but if a large fortune produces happiness Danglars is	124.62060546875
13402/28840	And Fernand   Fernand Why much the same	113.19852447509766
13403/28840	But how could a poor Catalan fisherboy without education or resources make a fortune I confess this staggers	327.2545166015625
13404/28840	There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one	99.41673278808594

13418/28840	The French government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer	319.9254150390625
13419/28840	Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece still having his name kept on the army	290.29937744140625

13422/28840	So that now continued Caderousse he owns a magnificent house	103.85813903808594
13423/28840	Has she made a fortune also inquired the abbé with an ironical	33.975189208984375
13424/28840	Mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris replied Cader	21.806371688842773
13425/28840	Go on said the abbé it seems as if I were listening to the story of a	27.778573989868164
13426/28840	But I have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise	136.48118591308594
13427/28840	Mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of Ed	46.600494384765625
13428/28840	I have told you of her attempts to propitiate	137.31263732910156
13429/28840	de Villefort her devotion to the elder Dantè	22.844797134399414
13430/28840	In the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook	107.97477722167969
13431/28840	This was the departure of Fernandof Fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her	128.68572998046875
13432/28840	Three months passed and still she weptno news of Edmond no news of Fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with	130.13473510742188
13433/28840	One evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans she returned to her home more depressed than	89.53301239013672
13434/28840	Suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and Fernand dressed in the uniform of a sublieutenant stood before	94.85221099853516
13435/28840	It was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to	58.96881103515625
13436/28840	Mercédès seized Fernands hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary	91.57484436035156
13437/28840	And then it must be confessed Fernand had never been hatedhe was only not precisely	194.51898193359375

13441/28840	At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercédès at the second he reminded her that he loved	50.069000244140625
13442/28840	Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Ed	63.66078186035156
13443/28840	So that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in	32.81614303588867
13444/28840	What more could the most devoted lover desire Then he murmured the words of the English poet Frailty thy name is	113.7419204711914

13448/28840	There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the Catalans and eight days after the wedding they left Marse	105.62821197509766
13449/28840	Did you ever see Mercédès again inquired the	31.902074813842773
13450/28840	Yes during the Spanish war at Perpignan where Fernand had left her she was attending to the education of her	200.59417724609375
13451/28840	But then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education	66.84148406982422
13452/28840	I understood from Edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but un	90.57311248779297
13453/28840	Oh replied Caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed Mercédès might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most	39.76435852050781
13454/28840	Fernands fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing	660.1524658203125
13455/28840	Besides I believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her	91.3080825805664
13456/28840	But now her position in life is assured continued Caderousse no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her she is rich a countess and yet   Caderousse	107.81456756591797
13457/28840	Yet I am sure she is not happy said Cader	25.24495506286621
13458/28840	What makes you believe this   Why when I found myself utterly destitute I thought my old friends would perhaps assist	81.12095642089844
13459/28840	So I went to Danglars who would not even receive	25.092493057250977
13460/28840	I called on Fernand who sent me a hundred francs by his valetdechamb	25.769269943237305

13468/28840	I know what happiness and what despair are and I never make a jest of such	116.95596313476562
13469/28840	Take it then but in exchange   Caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his	63.85940933227539

13472/28840	Caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been g	99.78494262695312
13473/28840	The abbé took it and in return gave Caderousse the	51.864952087402344
13474/28840	Oh you are a man of God sir cried Caderousse for no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept	36.5661506652832
13475/28840	Which said the abbé to himself you would have	24.23894500732422

13480/28840	When Caderousse turned around he saw behind him La Carconte paler and trembling more than	34.08028030395508
13481/28840	Is then all that I have heard really true she	119.43326568603516

13495/28840	Ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of	103.17906951904297

13505/28840	But said the Englishman this looks very much like a suspension of	87.43914031982422
13506/28840	It looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed	759.371826171875
13507/28840	The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said From which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension   To tell you the truth I consider it	103.90975952148438

13513/28840	de Bovilles countenance yet he made an effort at selfcontrol and said   Sir I ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this	48.730194091796875
13514/28840	Thats no affair of mine replied the Englishman that is the affair of the house of Thomson  French in whose name I	45.536659240722656
13515/28840	They have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival	169.7866973876953
13516/28840	But all I know sir is that I am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the	69.58792114257812
13517/28840	Of course that is perfectly just cried	212.01805114746094
13518/28840	The commission is usually one and a half will you have twothreefive per cent or even more Whatever you	244.46742248535156
13519/28840	Sir replied the Englishman laughing I am like my house and do not do such thingsno the commission I ask is quite	95.61547088623047
13520/28840	You are the inspector of prisons   I have been so these fourteen	34.5299072265625
13521/28840	You keep the registers of entries and departures   I	77.74480438232422
13522/28840	To these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners   There are special reports on every	241.5538787841797
13523/28840	Well sir I was educated at Rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared	73.32791900634766
13524/28840	I have since learned that he was confined in the Château dIf and I should like to learn some particulars of his	22.739501953125
13525/28840	What was his name   The Abbé Far	11.228684425354004
13526/28840	Oh I recollect him perfectly cried	121.98921966552734
13527/28840	Very possibly but what sort of madness was it   He pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate	107.32205963134766
13528/28840	Poor deviland he is dead   Yes sir five or six months ago last	95.23053741455078
13529/28840	You have a good memory sir to recollect dates so	103.32229614257812
13530/28840	I recollect this because the poor devils death was accompanied by a singular	86.31612396240234
13531/28840	May I ask what that was said the Englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic count	55.15998077392578
13532/28840	de Boville I myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of	80.74317932128906
13533/28840	That man made a deep impression on me I shall never forget his countenance   20025m       The Englishman smiled impercept	19.560728073120117
13534/28840	And you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons   Were separated by a distance of fifty feet but it appears that this Edmond Dantès   This dangerous mans name was   Edmond Dantè	37.51935577392578
13535/28840	It appears sir that this Edmond Dantès had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one	68.6308822631836
13536/28840	This tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape   No doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the Abbé Faria had an attack of catalepsy and	55.59941864013672
13537/28840	That must have cut short the projects of	311.7313232421875
13538/28840	For the dead man yes replied	200.27523803710938
13539/28840	de Boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this Dantès saw a means of accelerating his	57.71577453613281
13540/28840	It was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the English	144.89720153808594
13541/28840	As I have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his	55.118385314941406
13542/28840	How was that   How Do you not comprehend  	34.44589614868164
13543/28840	The Château dIf has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after fastening a thirtysixpound cannonball to their	70.79170227050781
13544/28840	Well observed the Englishman as if he were slow of	54.12154769897461
13545/28840	Well they fastened a thirtysixpound ball to his feet and threw him into the	39.52618408203125
13546/28840	Yes sir continued the inspector of	31.40451431274414
13547/28840	You may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks I should like to have seen his face at that	59.78136444091797
13548/28840	No matter replied De Boville in supreme goodhumor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francsno matter I can fancy	111.37650299072266
13549/28840	So can I said the Englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the English do at the end of his	68.2253646850586
13550/28840	And so continued the Englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned   Unquestion	111.57190704345703
13551/28840	So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time   Precise	52.12126159667969
13552/28840	20027m       But some official document was drawn up as to this affair I suppose inquired the English	54.802146911621094
13553/28840	You understand Dantès relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or	58.171443939208984
13554/28840	So that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy	146.70640563964844
13555/28840	He is dead and no mistake about	89.08645629882812
13556/28840	Oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they	171.3054656982422
13557/28840	True this story has diverted our attention from	405.5774841308594
13558/28840	Excuse you for what For the story By no means it really seems to me very	192.44052124023438
13559/28840	So sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé who really was gentleness	66.17452239990234
13560/28840	Go into my study here and I will show it to	42.12433624267578
13561/28840	Everything was here arranged in perfect order each register had its number each file of papers its	525.4885864257812
13562/28840	There he found everything arranged in due orderthe accusation examination Morrels petition	233.73487854003906
13563/28840	Then he saw through the whole	81.57992553710938
13564/28840	This petition to Napoleon kept back by Villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the kings	75.98311614990234
13565/28840	He was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name   Edmond Dantè	52.400115966796875
13566/28840	An inveterate Bonapartist took an active part in the return from the Island of El	47.79513168334961
13567/28840	To be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and	301.9543151855469
13568/28840	Beneath these lines was written in another hand See note abovenothing can be	618.5978393554688
13569/28840	He compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath Morrels petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificatethat is to say was in Villeforts	79.11357116699219
13570/28840	As we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the Abbé Farias pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading _Le Drapeau Blanc	61.03475570678711
13571/28840	He did not see the Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by Danglars under the arbor of La Réserve and which had the postmark Marseilles 27th February delivery 6 oclock	53.5157585144043
13572/28840	But it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the Englishman might do however irregular it might	60.4860725402832
13573/28840	Thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam I have all I want now it is for me to perform my	72.00299072265625
13574/28840	Give me a simple assignment of your debt acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and I will hand you over the	131.55426025390625
13575/28840	He rose gave his seat to	173.69143676757812
13576/28840	de Boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the Englishman counted out the banknotes on the other side of the	71.57032012939453
13577/28840	The House of Morrel  Son   Anyone who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of Morrels warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great	52.8851432800293
13578/28840	Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two	203.31565856933594
13579/28840	One was a young man of three or fourandtwenty who was in love with	23.52816390991211

13581/28840	He was however the same Cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against	129.11981201171875
13582/28840	Morrel and strong in the multiplicationtable which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch	142.39077758789062
13583/28840	In the midst of the disasters that befell the house Cocles was the only one unm	76.88984680175781
13584/28840	But this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm	84.53424072265625
13585/28840	Like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the	184.51039123535156
13586/28840	Cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their	235.12747192382812
13587/28840	Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles belief the last months payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude Cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to	109.45101165771484
13588/28840	Morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying   Thanks Cocles you are the pearl of cash	115.34654998779297
13589/28840	Cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of	420.56390380859375
13590/28840	Morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crown	67.55155944824219
13591/28840	But since the end of the month	65.96983337402344
13592/28840	Morrel had passed many an anxious	1197.818603515625
13593/28840	By this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now	131.19985961914062
13594/28840	Credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to	30.314208984375
13595/28840	Morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the _Pharaon_ of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in	56.584449768066406
13596/28840	But this vessel which like the _Pharaon_ came from Calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the _Pharaon	33.53288269042969
13597/28840	20033m       Such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with	34.03315353393555
13598/28840	de Boville the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson  French of Rome presented himself at	28.294321060180664
13599/28840	Emmanuel received him this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the	84.87942504882812
13600/28840	The young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the newcomer but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to	110.40510559082031
13601/28840	Emmanuel and that his business was with	94.8193359375
13602/28840	Cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to	193.7980499267578
13603/28840	Cocles went first and the stranger followed	431.00665283203125
13604/28840	On the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the	165.4000244140625
13605/28840	Morrel is in his room is he not Mademoiselle Julie said the cash	49.36796569824219
13606/28840	Yes I think so at least said the young girl hesitating	24.90199089050293
13607/28840	Go and see Cocles and if my father is there announce this	122.70516204833984
13608/28840	It will be useless to announce me mademoiselle returned the English	31.59343147277832
13609/28840	Morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson  French of Rome with whom your father does	63.65729522705078
13610/28840	The young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and Cocles continued to mount the	93.68083953857422
13611/28840	The Englishman entered and found Morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his	105.51126861572266
13612/28840	At the sight of the stranger	68.76463317871094
13613/28840	Morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own	132.1380615234375
13614/28840	The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with	43.81737518310547
13615/28840	The house of Thomson  French had 300000 or 400000 francs to pay this month in France and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money	128.8437042236328
13616/28840	Morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with pers	47.94465637207031
13617/28840	So then sir said Morrel you hold bills of mine   Yes and for a considerable	60.009132385253906
13618/28840	What is the amount asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render	56.99404525756836
13619/28840	20035m       Here is said the Englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of 200000 francs to our house by	30.1773624420166
13620/28840	de Boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are	54.170902252197266
13621/28840	You acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him   Yes he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years	88.1342544555664
13622/28840	When are you to pay   Half the 15th of this month half the 15th of	70.22565460205078
13623/28840	Just so and now here are 32500 francs payable shortly they are all signed by you and assigned to our house by the	83.12728118896484
13624/28840	I recognize them said Morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own	47.62382888793945
13625/28840	It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this enumer	67.94335174560547
13626/28840	Two hundred and eightyseven thousand five hundred francs repeated	162.5248260498047
13627/28840	I will not continued he after a moments silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your	106.09529876708984
13628/28840	At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly	467.423583984375
13629/28840	But as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality   Morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto	54.903526306152344
13630/28840	To questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be	504.2080993652344
13631/28840	Well said the other if this last resource fail you   Well returned Morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune I must habituate myself to	83.51680755615234
13632/28840	I fear I shall be forced to suspend	71.2945556640625
13633/28840	Have you no friends who could assist you   Morrel smiled mourn	61.43296813964844
13634/28840	In business sir said he one has no friends only correspond	146.4050750732422
13635/28840	It is true murmured the Englishman then you have but one	51.299278259277344
13636/28840	So that if this fail   I am ruinedcompletely ruined   As I was on my way here a vessel was coming into	86.5850601196289
13637/28840	And it is not yours   No she is a Bordeaux vessel _La Gironde_ she comes from India also but she is not	60.40470886230469
13638/28840	Perhaps she has spoken to the _Pharaon_ and brings you some tidings of her   Shall I tell you plainly one thing sir I dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in	46.880592346191406
13639/28840	Then in a low voice Morrel addedThis delay is not	55.03001403808594
13640/28840	The _Pharaon_ left Calcutta the 5th of February she ought to have been here a month	36.966552734375
13641/28840	What is the meaning of that noise   Oh my God cried Morrel turning pale what is it   A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and halfstifled so	52.355194091796875
13642/28840	Morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a	71.69475555419922
13643/28840	The two men remained opposite one another Morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound	87.06328582763672
13644/28840	The noise had ceased but it seemed that Morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise and something must	202.59632873535156
13645/28840	The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the	97.70372772216797
13646/28840	A key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was	81.84671020507812
13647/28840	There are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured Morrel Cocles and	52.276817321777344
13648/28840	At this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears	43.81188201904297
13649/28840	Morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the	146.00071716308594
13650/28840	He would have spoken but his voice failed	83.94949340820312

13652/28840	Oh father father murmured she courage   The _Pharaon_ has gone down then said Morrel in a hoarse	34.402469635009766
13653/28840	The young girl did not speak but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her fathers	59.19449996948242
13654/28840	Saved said the girl saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the	100.5766372680664
13655/28840	Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime	93.73812103271484
13656/28840	Thanks my God said he at least thou strikest but me	212.0208740234375
13657/28840	A tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic English	78.89996337890625

13659/28840	Scarcely had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping	203.16981506347656

13661/28840	At the sight of these men the Englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the	61.10977554321289
13662/28840	Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder Emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between Morrels family and the sailors at the	67.88349914550781
13663/28840	Draw nearer Penelon said the young man and tell us all about	28.296655654907227

13665/28840	Morrel said he as if he had just quitted Marseilles the previous evening and had just returned from Aix or Toul	41.06691360473633
13666/28840	Goodday Penelon returned Morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain   The captain	76.52152252197266

13669/28840	What do I think captain Why I think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didnt mean	113.77490997314453
13670/28840	Thats my opinion too said the captain and Ill take precautions	460.70751953125

13680/28840	His firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone	475.7425842285156
13681/28840	Penelon put his hand over his eyes and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manœuvres of his	41.82044219970703
13682/28840	We did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully we put the helm up to run before the tempest ten minutes after we struck our topsails and scudded under bare	118.35147094726562
13683/28840	The vessel was very old to risk that said the English	102.2940444946289
13684/28840	Eh it was that that did the business after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a	230.12045288085938
13685/28840	Penelon said the captain I think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the	48.98965835571289
13686/28840	I gave him the helm and descended there was already three feet of	134.33084106445312
13687/28840	All hands to the pumps I shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came	122.91744995117188
13688/28840	Ah said I after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but	165.81715393066406
13689/28840	Is that the example you set Penelon cries the captain very well wait a	164.3314208984375
13690/28840	He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of	54.30562210083008
13691/28840	I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump said	97.142822265625
13692/28840	Two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hours that makes two feet and three we had before that makes	267.8154602050781
13693/28840	Come said the captain we have done all in our power and	38.81999969482422
13694/28840	Morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save	126.57954406738281
13695/28840	To the boats my lads as quick as you	116.9455337524414
13696/28840	Morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say Get alongsave	110.25527954101562
13697/28840	We soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into	272.1650390625
13698/28840	The captain descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the vessel so I took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then I jumped after	103.70195007324219
13699/28840	It was time for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a manof	99.70218658447266

13701/28840	Morrel thats the whole truth on the honor of a sailor is not it true you fellows there A general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and suffer	87.89608001708984
13702/28840	Morrel I know there was no one in fault but	124.3909683227539
13703/28840	It was the will of God that this should happen blessed be his	128.73065185546875
13704/28840	What wages are due to you   Oh dont let us talk of that	41.495357513427734
13705/28840	Yes but we will talk of	56.93988037109375
13706/28840	Cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said Mor	88.87358856201172
13707/28840	At another time added he I should have said Give them besides two hundred francs over as a present but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this	129.75694274902344
13708/28840	Penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with	40.50043869018555
13709/28840	Morrel said he again turning his quid as for that   As for what   The	78.21551513671875
13710/28840	Well   Well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the	54.843971252441406
13711/28840	Thanks my friends thanks cried Morrel gratefully take ittake it and if you can find another employer enter his service you are free to do	82.62480926513672
13712/28840	These last words produced a prodigious effect on the se	122.22281646728516
13713/28840	Penelon nearly swallowed his quid fortunately he	232.83538818359375
13714/28840	Morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us   No no said	45.64212417602539
13715/28840	Morrel I am not angry quite the contrary and I do not send you away but I have no more ships and therefore I do not want any	70.9527359008789
13716/28840	No more ships returned Penelon well then youll build some well wait for	176.39161682128906
13717/28840	I have no money to build ships with Penelon said the poor owner mournfully so I cannot accept your kind	120.33091735839844
13718/28840	No more money Then you must not pay us we can scud like the _Pharaon_ under bare	67.23200988769531
13719/28840	Enough enough cried Morrel almost overpowered leave me I pray you we shall meet again in a happier	83.54074096679688
13720/28840	Emmanuel go with them and see that my orders are	77.51238250732422
13721/28840	At least we shall see each other again	127.75262451171875
13722/28840	He made a sign to Cocles who went first the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the	75.4809799194336
13723/28840	Now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me I wish to speak with this	33.483543395996094
13724/28840	20045m       And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson  French who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have	35.87211990356445
13725/28840	The two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment Julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern	96.39788818359375
13726/28840	Well sir said Morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and I have nothing further to tell	45.396541595458984
13727/28840	I see returned the Englishman that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you and this only increases my desire to serve	134.28460693359375
13728/28840	Let me see continued the stranger I am one of your largest	82.29637145996094
13729/28840	Your bills at least are the first that will fall	175.28292846679688
13730/28840	Do you wish for time to pay   A delay would save my honor and consequently my	85.09185791015625
13731/28840	How long a delay do you wish for   Morrel	86.14450073242188
13732/28840	I will give you three replied the	53.42287826538086
13733/28840	But asked Morrel will the house of Thomson  French consent   Oh I take everything on	39.79814147949219
13734/28840	Well renew these bills up to the 5th of September and on the 5th of September at eleven oclock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven I shall come to receive the	47.18748092651367
13735/28840	I shall expect you returned Morrel and I will pay youor I shall be	64.47647094726562
13736/28840	These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear	68.88773345947266
13737/28840	The bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor shipowner found himself with three months before him to collect his	117.52887725830078
13738/28840	The Englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and Morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the	154.23382568359375
13739/28840	The stranger met Julie on the stairs she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for	135.16407775878906
13740/28840	Mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed Sinbad the	21.823057174682617
13741/28840	Do exactly what the letter bids you however strange it may	394.17132568359375
13742/28840	Do you promise   I swear to you I	25.190570831298828
13743/28840	Continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and I have great hopes that Heaven will reward you by giving you Emmanuel for a	118.93122863769531
13744/28840	Julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the bal	186.15943908691406
13745/28840	The stranger waved his hand and continued to	326.6427307128906
13746/28840	In the court he found Penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain	58.16459274291992
13747/28840	Come with me my friend said the Englishman I wish to speak to	15.479927062988281
13748/28840	The same day he told his wife Emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the	80.33916473388672
13749/28840	Unfortunately however Morrel had not only engagements with the house of Thomson  French who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not	78.01593780517578
13750/28840	Unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all Morrels correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary	185.97259521484375
13751/28840	The bills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the Englishman were paid by Cocles with equal punct	108.030029296875
13752/28840	Cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquill	241.4723358154297
13753/28840	It was Morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50000 francs of	66.9045639038086
13754/28840	de Boville and on the 30th the 32500 francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined	65.10979461669922
13755/28840	The opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down Morrel it was impossible for him to remain	98.57868957519531
13756/28840	Great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punct	46.1400032043457
13757/28840	Still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the	89.98945617675781
13758/28840	The month passed and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his	324.9132995605469
13759/28840	Formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in	289.04229736328125
13760/28840	Morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him	279.9715270996094
13761/28840	Fortunately Morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of July	82.88587951660156
13762/28840	The agent of Thomson  French had not been again seen at Marseilles the day after or two days after his visit to Morrel he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and	54.23876190185547
13763/28840	Morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three	205.6117706298828
13764/28840	As to the sailors of the _Pharaon_ they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had	35.5467414855957
13765/28840	Captain Gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from Pal	207.96177673339844
13766/28840	He delayed presenting himself at Morrels but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see	110.10906219482422
13767/28840	The worthy shipowner knew from Penelons recital of the captains brave conduct during the storm and tried to console	187.10374450683594
13768/28840	He brought him also the amount of his wages which Captain Gaumard had not dared to apply	56.99858474731445
13769/28840	As he descended the staircase Morrel met Penelon who was going	46.06793212890625
13770/28840	Penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly	159.505859375
13771/28840	Perhaps he had come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new	64.38243103027344
13772/28840	But contrary to all expectation when the 31st of August came the house opened as usual and Cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual	181.16651916503906
13773/28840	There came in moreover two drafts which	373.7602233886719
13774/28840	Morrel had fully anticipated and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had	164.6705322265625
13775/28840	All this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of	153.17431640625
13776/28840	On the 1st Morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to Paris they hoped great	173.0550537109375
13777/28840	It was said at this moment that Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited	43.99103546142578
13778/28840	Danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save Morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and Morrel was	57.143306732177734
13779/28840	Morrel had long thought of Danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last	56.86911392211914
13780/28840	And Morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a	89.07626342773438
13781/28840	Yet on his arrival Morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh	166.1206512451172
13782/28840	He embraced his weeping wife and daughter pressed Emmanuels hand with friendly warmth and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for Coc	167.3138885498047
13783/28840	Then said the two women to Emmanuel we are indeed	175.7749786376953
13784/28840	It was agreed in a brief council held among them that Julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at Nîmes to come to them as speedily as	85.97908020019531

13791/28840	In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the sto	78.97747039794922

13793/28840	This was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to	78.18993377685547
13794/28840	They had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles Julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost constern	123.72382354736328
13795/28840	Morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the	375.4015197753906
13796/28840	All his funds amounted to 6000 or 8000 francs his bills receivable up to the 5th to 4000 or 5000 which making the best of everything gave him 14000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287500 franc	118.3917236328125
13797/28840	He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on	176.71591186523438
13798/28840	However when Morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very	68.57936096191406
13799/28840	This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have	71.99759674072266
13800/28840	After dinner Morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the Phocéens and read the _Semaphore_ this day he did not leave the house but returned to his	70.11764526367188
13801/28840	As to Cocles he seemed completely bewild	111.98397064208984
13802/28840	For part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing	57.56452941894531

13805/28840	Night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room Morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his	67.92951202392578

13808/28840	In the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was Julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her	301.11962890625
13809/28840	The young lady went towards Madame Mor	74.8271484375
13810/28840	They had understood each other without	152.8313446044922
13811/28840	Madame Morrel looked again through the keyhole Morrel was writing but Madame Morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped	105.08999633789062
13812/28840	The terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her she shuddered and yet had not strength to utter a	78.15198516845703
13813/28840	Morrel seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfast punctually and then after dinner he placed his daughter beside him took her head in his arms and held her for a long time against his bos	74.31861877441406
13814/28840	In the evening Julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her fathers heart beat	143.28021240234375
13815/28840	The next two days passed in much the same	186.71864318847656
13816/28840	On the evening of the 4th of September	58.2149543762207
13817/28840	Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his	110.90045928955078
13818/28840	Julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad o	291.530517578125
13819/28840	Why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment The young girl looked at Mor	95.26383209228516
13820/28840	What have I done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me   Nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple questionnothing only I want	95.24211120605469
13821/28840	Julie made a pretence to feel for the	342.5191345214844
13822/28840	I must have left it in my room she	47.24998474121094
13823/28840	And she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult	55.358604431152344
13824/28840	Do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a	63.02150344848633
13825/28840	She questioned Emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he	141.67666625976562
13826/28840	During the night between the 4th and 5th of September Madame Morrel remained listening for every sound and until three oclock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great	67.1362533569336
13827/28840	It was three oclock when he threw himself on the	21.344301223754883
13828/28840	The mother and daughter passed the night	376.98095703125
13829/28840	They had expected Maximilian since the previous	45.825321197509766

13836/28840	I wish you to do so said	25.505374908447266
13837/28840	This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and Julie did not dare to disob	43.00299835205078
13838/28840	She remained at the same spot standing mute and motion	66.91036224365234
13839/28840	An instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her	197.23043823242188
13840/28840	She looked up and uttered an exclamation of	39.81888961791992

13842/28840	At these words Madame Morrel rose and threw herself into her sons	75.78633880615234
13843/28840	Mother said the young man looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter what has occurredwhat has happened Your letter has frightened me and I have come hither with all	64.35603332519531
13844/28840	Julie said Madame Morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that Maximilian has just	44.91552734375
13845/28840	The young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his	37.926448822021484
13846/28840	Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel inquired the man with a strong Italian	36.6386604309082
13847/28840	Yes sir replied Julie with hesitation what is your pleasure I do not know	45.52421951293945
13848/28840	Read this letter he said handing it to	90.6573257446289
13849/28840	It concerns the best interests of your father said the	72.93189239501953
13850/28840	The young girl hastily took the letter from	67.80977630615234
13851/28840	She opened it quickly and read   Go this moment to the Allées de Meilhan enter the house	45.4384651184082

13854/28840	The young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eyes looked round to question the messenger but he had	108.20170593261719
13855/28840	She cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a post	99.45409393310547
13856/28840	She read   It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and	65.11029052734375
13857/28840	If you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about	85.59867858886719
13858/28840	This postscript decreased greatly the young girls	182.95277404785156
13859/28840	Was there nothing to fear was there not some snare laid for her Her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her	118.3132095336914
13860/28840	But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest	100.02179718017578
13861/28840	Julie hesitated and resolved to take	1146.358642578125
13862/28840	Yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to	153.27420043945312
13863/28840	She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of Thomson  French had come to her fathers related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the	70.36865234375
13864/28840	You must go then mademoiselle said	56.29167556762695
13865/28840	But did you not read that I must be alone said	88.4110107421875
13866/28840	And you shall be alone replied the young	29.71028709411621
13867/28840	Did not the messenger say your fathers safety depended upon it   But what danger threatens him then Emmanuel she	299.616455078125
13868/28840	Emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make Julie decide immediately made him	223.70750427246094
13869/28840	Listen he said today is the 5th of September is it not  	24.172094345092773
13870/28840	Today then at eleven oclock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay   Yes we know	28.868877410888672
13871/28840	Well then continued Emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the	40.48735427856445
13872/28840	What will happen then   Why if today before eleven oclock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve oclock to declare himself a	63.810733795166016
13873/28840	Oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young	118.76812744140625
13874/28840	During this time Madame Morrel had told her son	120.86543273925781
13875/28840	The young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a	61.6772346496582
13876/28840	Then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in	129.837646484375
13877/28840	While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his	59.90723419189453
13878/28840	Instead of going direct to his study	214.76287841796875
13879/28840	Morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment	82.54652404785156
13880/28840	Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was	48.64015579223633
13881/28840	He remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his	63.756141662597656
13882/28840	Maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his fathers neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on Morrels	58.0107536315918
13883/28840	Father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat   Oh this is what I feared said Mor	43.8447151184082
13884/28840	Father father in Heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for   Maximilian replied Morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of	43.79801559448242
13885/28840	Come and I will explain to	20.15688705444336
13886/28840	And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study while Maximilian followed him trembling as he	42.891849517822266
13887/28840	Morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the pistols and pointed with his finger to an open	62.90951156616211
13888/28840	In this ledger was made out an exact balancesheet of his	103.37728881835938
13889/28840	Morrel had to pay within half an hour 287500 franc	71.79947662353516
13890/28840	The young man was overwhelmed as he	102.39545440673828
13891/28840	What could he say What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures   And have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result asked the young man after a moments	83.59872436523438
13892/28840	You have no money coming in on which you can rely  	95.7799301147461
13893/28840	You have exhausted every resource  	144.70574951171875
13894/28840	And in half an hour said Maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored   Blood washes out dishonor said Mor	66.72989654541016
13895/28840	You are right father I understand	83.80726623535156
13896/28840	Then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said There is one for you and one for methanks   Morrel caught his	59.48095703125
13897/28840	Your motheryour sister Who will support them   A shudder ran through the young mans	132.91806030273438
13898/28840	Father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live   Yes I do so bid you answered Morrel it is your	41.37079620361328

13901/28840	The young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his	74.67484283447266
13902/28840	Be it so then my father he said extending his hand to Morrel die in peace my father I will	59.41609573364258
13903/28840	Morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but Maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a	52.195316314697266
13904/28840	You know it is not my fault said Mor	19.127431869506836

13906/28840	I know father you are the most honorable man I have ever	83.30548858642578
13907/28840	And now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and	68.92076110839844
13908/28840	On seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on	121.05587768554688
13909/28840	To you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to	124.84615325927734

13915/28840	The young man uttered a groan but appeared	124.64432525634766
13916/28840	And now said Morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister	104.23897552490234
13917/28840	Will you not see my sister once more asked Maximil	51.473236083984375
13918/28840	A last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested	98.66436767578125
13919/28840	I saw her this morning and bade her ad	96.34623718261719
13920/28840	Have you no particular commands to leave with me my father inquired Maximilian in a faltering	67.41319274902344

13928/28840	The young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of	90.83309173583984
13929/28840	And he rushed out of the	68.26470947265625
13930/28840	When his son had left him Morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the	80.77210235595703
13931/28840	It was no longer the same manthe fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed	123.0554428100586

13935/28840	Cocles made no reply he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated	52.96523666381836
13936/28840	Morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was	86.29456329345703
13937/28840	The hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its	174.17970275878906
13938/28840	What passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony cannot be told in	150.21868896484375
13939/28840	He was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life	139.4110870361328
13940/28840	To form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tearmoistened eyes raised to	89.43973541259766
13941/28840	The pistols were loaded he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughters	198.48562622070312
13942/28840	Then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few	127.22252655029297
13943/28840	It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved	35.089515686035156
13944/28840	Then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by	425.40673828125
13945/28840	He took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the	63.427894592285156
13946/28840	At this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart	175.02401733398438
13947/28840	He heard the door of the staircase creak on its hingesthe clock gave its warning to strike eleventhe door of his study	173.87026977539062
13948/28840	Morrel did not turn roundhe expected these words of Cocles The agent of Thomson 	161.5480499267578
13949/28840	He placed the muzzle of the pistol between his	72.07791137695312
13950/28840	Suddenly he heard a cryit was his daughters	219.0374298095703

13953/28840	Morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to	136.68751525878906
13954/28840	At one end was the receipted bill for the 287000 francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazelnut with these words on a small slip of parchment _Julies Dowry	106.2855224609375
13955/28840	Morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a	54.65311050415039
13956/28840	At this moment the clock struck	89.9747314453125
13957/28840	He felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his	126.44217681884766

13967/28840	In a moment they were at the Canebi	28.35024642944336

13974/28840	To doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the	140.3454132080078
13975/28840	Italy Sinbad the Sailor   Towards the beginning of the year 1838 two young men belonging to the first society of Paris the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron Franz dÉpinay were at	20.918550491333008
13976/28840	They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year and that Franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy should act as _cicerone_ to	68.66712188720703
13977/28840	Signor Pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis per di	78.78544616699219
13978/28840	They accepted his offer but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left Albert started for	162.67547607421875
13979/28840	He traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and reembarked for Marc	124.14115142822266

13981/28840	The sport was bad Franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of	212.92724609375
13982/28840	Ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital	64.02600860595703
13983/28840	Where   Do you see that island continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo	126.4520034790039
13984/28840	Well what is this island   The Island of Monte Crist	16.897035598754883
13985/28840	But I have no permission to shoot over this	116.51166534423828

13988/28840	It is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of	97.17196655273438
13989/28840	To whom does this island belong   To Tusc	70.44294738769531

13991/28840	Who live upon the stones I suppose said Franz with an incredulous	130.41209411621094
13992/28840	No but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the	70.07051849365234
13993/28840	As Franz had sufficient time and his apartments at Rome were not yet available he accepted the	173.97567749023438
13994/28840	Upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low	66.18932342529297
13995/28840	Well asked he what now Is there any difficulty in the way  	67.9288330078125
13996/28840	replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected	59.4907112121582
13997/28840	The deuce That puts a different face on the	389.8559875488281
13998/28840	Six days Why thats as long as the Almighty took to make the world Too long a waittoo	286.2299499511719
13999/28840	But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo   Oh I shall not cried	23.954559326171875
14000/28840	Nor I nor I chorused the	653.6846313476562
14001/28840	The captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the	82.00218963623047
14002/28840	Franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their placesthree forward and one at the helmhe resumed the	128.44039916992188
14003/28840	Gaetano said he to the captain you tell me Monte Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the	57.37273025512695
14004/28840	Yes your excellency and it is	15.514498710632324
14005/28840	I knew there were smugglers but I thought that since the capture of Algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of Cooper and Captain Marry	189.78892517089844
14006/28840	Your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo	75.59119415283203
14007/28840	and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of	133.13461303710938
14008/28840	Has not your excellency heard that the French _chargé daffaires_ was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of Velletri   Oh yes I heard	78.53250122070312
14009/28840	Now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a	135.59231567382812
14010/28840	But asked Franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French Sardinian or Tuscan governments   Why said Gaetano with a	43.29074478149414
14011/28840	At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle	124.52906799316406
14012/28840	First one gunl goes under then the	857.7433471679688
14013/28840	Then they lift and sink again and both go under at	458.75323486328125
14014/28840	All at once theres a noise like a cannonthats the air blowing up the	172.45501708984375
14015/28840	He was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable cool	86.89663696289062
14016/28840	Bah said he I have travelled through Sicily and CalabriaI have sailed two months in the Archipelago and yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a	69.70145416259766
14017/28840	I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied Gaetano but you questioned me and I have answered thats	53.825347900390625
14018/28840	Yes and your conversation is most interesting and as I wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for Monte Crist	39.10623550415039
14019/28840	The wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their	169.06405639648438
14020/28840	As they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crev	87.94371032714844
14021/28840	As for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishingboats with their white sails were alone	116.65887451171875
14022/28840	Hush said the captain it is a	65.84669494628906
14023/28840	But you told me the island was uninhabited   I said there were no fixed habitations on it but I said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for	117.73652648925781
14024/28840	And for pirates   And for pirates returned Gaetano repeating Franzs	84.55427551269531
14025/28840	It is for that reason I have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind	69.48800659179688
14026/28840	It seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen would not light a	85.72856903076172
14027/28840	Oh that goes for nothing said Gaet	98.99604034423828
14028/28840	If you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa but only from the	63.590789794921875
14029/28840	You think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors   That is what we must find out returned Gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial	80.80970001220703
14030/28840	How can you find out   You shall	37.69682693481445
14031/28840	Gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the	71.12104797363281
14032/28840	The pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of	97.9271469116211
14033/28840	Gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to	139.1116180419922
14034/28840	All this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was	93.97988891601562
14035/28840	Gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be	116.97079467773438
14036/28840	As for Franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two doublebarrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited	104.12432098388672
14037/28840	This track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the	81.71096801757812
14038/28840	Everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on	78.9664306640625
14039/28840	Well exclaimed Franz and the sailors in	103.9535140991211
14040/28840	They are Spanish smugglers said he they have with them two Corsican	116.18195343017578
14041/28840	And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish smugglers   Alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one	107.20319366455078
14042/28840	This costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellowcreature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without	164.28660583496094
14043/28840	Ah said Franz then you are a smuggler occasionally Gaetano   Your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetr	46.70390319824219
14044/28840	Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo   Oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by	66.07328033447266
14045/28840	And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land   Nothing at all smugglers are not	63.13227844238281
14046/28840	But these two Corsican bandits said Franz calculating the chances of	86.42316436767578
14047/28840	It is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the	85.97682189941406
14048/28840	How so   Because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a Corsicans nature to revenge	48.07243728637695
14049/28840	What do you mean by having made a stiffhaving assassinated a man said Franz continuing his	152.4448699951172
14050/28840	I mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the	49.136417388916016
14051/28840	Well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and	75.150146484375
14052/28840	Do you think they will grant it   Without	98.47293853759766
14053/28840	How many are they   Four and the two bandits make	259.204833984375
14054/28840	Just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last time steer to Monte Crist	57.3735237121582
14055/28840	Yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due	39.90989685058594
14056/28840	By all means be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses I do more than permit I exhort	126.85246276855469
14057/28840	For a man who like Franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave	159.59371948242188
14058/28840	On the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and	96.35206604003906
14059/28840	The history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his	95.52515411376953
14060/28840	The sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the	254.2974395751953
14061/28840	Through the darkness Franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons	125.22402954101562
14062/28840	The blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces	110.77645874023438
14063/28840	Gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the	134.5840301513672
14064/28840	At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landingplace their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the newcomers were and what were their	95.91008758544922
14065/28840	They soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was ro	100.34956359863281
14066/28840	When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried Who comes there in Sard	86.58146667480469
14067/28840	Gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned	80.34076690673828
14068/28840	Will your excellency give your name or remain _incognito_ asked the	32.75436782836914
14069/28840	My name must rest unknown replied Franz merely say I am a Frenchman travelling for	438.4190673828125
14070/28840	As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the	73.00077819824219
14071/28840	Not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied Franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each	110.35873413085938
14072/28840	The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said _Saccommodi	39.38457107543945
14073/28840	The Italian _saccommodi_ is untranslatable it means at once Come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the	192.7367706298828
14074/28840	It is like that Turkish phrase of Molières that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utter	159.8385772705078
14075/28840	The sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land Gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came	116.96198272705078
14076/28840	One of his guns was swung over his shoulder Gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquiet	95.89422607421875
14077/28840	Gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their	105.80232238769531
14078/28840	They advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry	134.26194763183594
14079/28840	Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrt	61.99074172973633
14080/28840	Franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the haltingplaces of the wandering visitors of Monte Crist	80.67887115478516
14081/28840	As for his suspicions once on _terra firma_ once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to	124.74658966064453
14082/28840	He mentioned this to Gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them	115.32267761230469
14083/28840	Besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you I will go and offer them two of our birds for a	163.33460998535156
14084/28840	You are a born diplomat returned Franz go and	197.74761962890625
14085/28840	Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a	163.7434539794922
14086/28840	Franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious	141.39590454101562
14087/28840	Well said Franz anything newdo they refuse   On the contrary returned Gaetano the chief who was told you were a young Frenchman invites you to sup with	82.3626708984375
14088/28840	Well observed Franz this chief is very polite and I see no objectionthe more so as I bring my share of the	188.75662231445312
14089/28840	Oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his	110.86186218261719
14090/28840	His house Has he built one here then   No but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they	125.61359405517578
14091/28840	You know this chief then   I have heard talk of	63.81666946411133
14092/28840	The deuceand what is this condition   That you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids	98.88455963134766
14093/28840	Franz looked at Gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this	79.04147338867188
14094/28840	Ah replied he guessing Franzs thought I know this is a serious	87.07972717285156
14095/28840	What should you do in my place   I who have nothing to loseI should	59.79210662841797

14097/28840	There is something very peculiar about this chief then   Listen said Gaetano lowering his voice I do not know if what they say is truehe stopped to see if anyone was	71.07304382324219
14098/28840	What do they say   That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is	95.93465423583984
14099/28840	It is no nonsense it is quite	78.37769317626953
14100/28840	Cama the pilot of the _Saint Ferdinand_ went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy	129.90243530273438
14101/28840	Do you know observed Franz that with such stories you make me think of Ali Babas enchanted cavern   I tell you what I have been	55.902130126953125
14102/28840	Then you advise me to accept   Oh I dont say that your excellency will do as you please I should be sorry to advise you in the	18.631765365600586
14103/28840	Franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper	134.3285369873047
14104/28840	Franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his	303.1778869628906

14111/28840	And how did a leader of smugglers continued Franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa   I did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the	67.265869140625
14112/28840	Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to	78.16481018066406

14120/28840	Where will he receive me   No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you	58.180931091308594
14121/28840	Decidedly muttered Franz this is an Arabian Nights	1119.9742431640625

14123/28840	He was accompanied by two of the yachts	127.16587829589844

14125/28840	Without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indisc	87.70915222167969
14126/28840	Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the band	83.44033813476562
14127/28840	Then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sent	63.679725646972656

14129/28840	At length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of	199.56646728515625
14130/28840	There was a moments silence and then a voice in excellent French although with a foreign accent said   Welcome	98.89022064208984
14131/28840	I beg you will remove your band	102.74957275390625
14132/28840	His pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of	84.65372467041016
14133/28840	He was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the South had small hands and	224.7257537841797
14134/28840	But what astonished Franz who had treated Gaetanos description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found	60.904510498046875
14135/28840	The entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of	324.24176025390625
14136/28840	The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off	240.30142211914062
14137/28840	Let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find herethat is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable	107.04090881347656
14138/28840	_Ma foi_ my dear sir replied Franz make no	80.36456298828125

14141/28840	Ali is the supper ready   At this moment the tapestry moved aside and a Nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining	47.700836181640625
14142/28840	Now said the unknown to Franz I do not know if you are of my opinion but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one	44.782711029052734

14147/28840	That will keep us from going away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have been conveyed by some good	72.64613342285156
14148/28840	Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around	179.68280029296875
14149/28840	The diningroom was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique basreliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their	114.46916198730469

14155/28840	Ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host there	129.0478515625
14156/28840	Yes replied he while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and graceyes he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me and does all he can to prove	116.32830047607422
14157/28840	He remembers that I saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his	124.5927963256836
14158/28840	Ali approached his master took his hand and kissed	38.832523345947266
14159/28840	Would it be impertinent Signor Sinbad said Franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness   20081m       Oh they are simple enough replied the	25.749168395996094
14160/28840	He hesitated a moment he was so very desirous to complete the poor devils	95.81578826904297

14163/28840	Franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the halfkindness halfcruelty with which his host related the brief	311.684814453125

14182/28840	I should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if I go there it will be in all probability _incognito	51.05623245239258
14183/28840	The supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample	207.90187072753906
14184/28840	Then Ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the	65.39434051513672
14185/28840	Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver	174.1112060546875
14186/28840	The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table roused Franzs	269.9515075683594
14187/28840	He raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste something like preserved angelica but which was perfectly unknown to	152.67794799804688
14188/28840	He replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his	78.73658752441406

14209/28840	They both arose and while he who called himself Sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant Franz entered still another	199.08753967285156
14210/28840	It was round and a large divan completely encircled	102.33536529541016
14211/28840	Both laid themselves down on the divan chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe	110.59300231933594

14220/28840	As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in	84.96551513671875

14222/28840	At length the boat touched the shore but without effort without shock as lips touch lips and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious	198.5500030517578

14226/28840	It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the Prophet to the	104.0226821899414

14230/28840	The vision had fled and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb they had vanished at his	151.83389282226562

14232/28840	He found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure	96.24911499023438
14233/28840	The air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the	109.56050872802734
14234/28840	There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as	93.44125366210938
14235/28840	He recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hash	99.72476959228516
14236/28840	It seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his	118.52847290039062
14237/28840	Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and	129.6276397705078

14244/28840	After a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then Franz heard a slight	94.07422637939453

14248/28840	In the first place light me a	297.174560546875
14249/28840	Ah yes I understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted	103.03314971923828
14250/28840	With much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you and I will get you the torch you ask	76.83369445800781
14251/28840	But I too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but I have always given it	58.67176055908203

14253/28840	Franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by Gaet	51.649051666259766
14254/28840	He recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the gro	74.8261489868164
14255/28840	He saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in	269.08270263671875
14256/28840	All was vain and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly	138.59840393066406
14257/28840	At the end of this time he gave up his search and Gaetano	39.11229705810547
14258/28840	When Franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the	130.61448669433594
14259/28840	He looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish	81.9150390625
14260/28840	Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly	50.06847381591797
14261/28840	He took his fowlingpiece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two	44.6298828125
14262/28840	These animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and Franz could not consider them as	422.39501953125
14263/28840	Moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his	197.49217224121094
14264/28840	Since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the _Thousand and One Nights_ and he was irresistibly attracted towards the gro	43.043487548828125
14265/28840	Then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two	54.35285949707031
14266/28840	The second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast	120.75131225585938
14267/28840	Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a seagull on the wave continuing her flight towards Cors	72.21875762939453
14268/28840	Why he remarked to Gaetano you told me that Signor Sinbad was going to Malaga while it seems he is in the direction of PortoVec	26.22312355041504
14269/28840	Dont you remember said the patron I told you that among the crew there were two Corsican brigands   True and he is going to land them added	61.726837158203125
14270/28840	Ah he is one who fears neither God nor Satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a	183.01235961914062
14271/28840	20093m       But such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said	46.86231231689453
14272/28840	And what cares he for that replied Gaetano with a laugh or any authorities He smiles at	168.65968322753906
14273/28840	As to Franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at Monte Crist	57.250736236572266
14274/28840	He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under	79.70072174072266
14275/28840	At the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of PortoVec	50.00986099243164
14276/28840	With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper Sinbad hashish statuesall became a dream for	128.5175323486328
14277/28840	The boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of Monte Crist	86.00609588623047
14278/28840	When Franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at Florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at	84.48749542236328
14279/28840	He set out and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by the mailco	133.671630859375
14280/28840	An apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrinis	57.08589553833008
14281/28840	At last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the	100.66937255859375
14282/28840	On his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackneycoachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the Hôtel de Lond	52.13582992553711
14283/28840	Then he sent his card to Signor Pastrini and asked for Albert de Morcer	26.597576141357422
14284/28840	The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a par	123.66271209716797
14285/28840	The two rooms looked on to the streeta fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable	122.00248718261719
14286/28840	The rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller	93.47472381591797
14287/28840	Very good signor Pastrini said Franz but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following	128.56072998046875
14288/28840	As to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the carriage   What as to the carriage exclaimed	115.60435485839844
14289/28840	Come come Signor Pastrini no joking we must have a	45.56782913208008
14290/28840	Sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you onethis is all I can	52.373634338378906
14291/28840	And when shall we know inquired	299.0713195800781
14292/28840	Oh the deuce then we shall pay the more thats all I see plainly	115.67498779296875
14293/28840	At Drakes or Aarons one pays twentyfive lire for common days and thirty or thirtyfive lire a day more for Sundays and feast days add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and theres an end of	268.34326171875
14294/28840	I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a	118.28563690185547
14295/28840	Then they must put horses to	392.75836181640625
14296/28840	It is a little worse for the journey but thats no	107.62149047851562
14297/28840	Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not	53.37715530395508
14298/28840	Do you understand that my dear Franzno horses he said but cant we have posthorses   They have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for	134.8722381591797
14299/28840	What are we to say to this asked	64.42317962646484
14300/28840	I say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension I am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to	160.06089782714844
14301/28840	Is supper ready Signor Pastrini   Yes your excell	17.471406936645508
14302/28840	But the carriage and horses said	125.2323226928711
14303/28840	Be easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only a question of how much shall be charged for	81.46827697753906
14304/28840	Morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or welllined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with six	247.53330993652344
14305/28840	Roman Bandits   The next morning Franz woke first and instantly rang the	207.38197326660156
14306/28840	The sound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself	43.94601821899414
14307/28840	What is the matter said Albert entering no carriage to be had   Just so returned Franz you have guessed	69.13219451904297
14308/28840	Well your Eternal City is a nice sort of	184.71055603027344
14309/28840	Ah that is something said Albert today is Thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and Sunday   Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied Franz which will make it still more	107.3906021118164
14310/28840	My friend said Morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the	77.45063781738281
14311/28840	At least we can have a window   Where   In the Cor	56.09847640991211
14312/28840	Ah a window exclaimed Signor Pastriniutterly impossible there was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace and that has been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a	79.66333770751953
14313/28840	The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupef	10.590806007385254
14314/28840	Well said Franz to Albert do you know what is the best thing we can do It is to pass the Carnival at Venice there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have car	69.88545989990234
14315/28840	Ah the devil no cried Albert I came to Rome to see the Carnival and I will though I see it on st	114.17681121826172

14317/28840	But excellencysaid Pastrini still striving to gain his	95.15259552001953
14318/28840	Do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned Signor Pastrini with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he confesses defeat I will do all I can and I hope you will be	46.94779586791992
14319/28840	When do you wish the carriage to be here   In an	31.354366302490234
14320/28840	In an hour it will be at the	30.915979385375977
14321/28840	Excellency cried the _cicerone_ seeing Franz approach the window shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace   Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to	57.63731002807617
14322/28840	Franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the Hôtel de Londres was the	26.63103485107422
14323/28840	The genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that	261.0315856933594
14324/28840	Franz and Albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the _cicerone_ sprang into the seat	85.5427017211914
14325/28840	Where do your excellencies wish to go asked	46.45381546020508
14326/28840	To Saint Peters first and then to the Colosseum returned	44.884666442871094
14327/28840	But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peters and a month to study	88.26509857177734
14328/28840	The day was passed at Saint Peters	236.10379028320312
14329/28840	Suddenly the daylight began to fade away Franz took out his watchit was halfpast	126.74073791503906
14330/28840	They returned to the hotel at the door Franz ordered the coachman to be ready at	56.76237106323242
14331/28840	He wished to show Albert the Colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him Saint Peters by	69.79264831542969
14332/28840	When we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have	218.3882293701172
14333/28840	Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable rep	51.67266082763672
14334/28840	At the end of the dinner he entered in	50.445228576660156
14335/28840	Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was	119.16885375976562
14336/28840	Excellency said Pastrini I am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that I	27.610517501831055
14337/28840	Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked Albert lighting his	58.99162292480469
14338/28840	No and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at Rome things can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of	62.195186614990234
14339/28840	It is much more convenient at Pariswhen anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done	189.4762420654297
14340/28840	That is what all the French say returned Signor Pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason I do not understand why they	53.002105712890625
14341/28840	But said Albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do	211.4095916748047
14342/28840	Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder their walk on the Boulevard de Gand and the Café de	60.207122802734375
14343/28840	It is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its wait	144.65061950683594
14344/28840	Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very	63.06124496459961
14345/28840	You mean the Colosseum   It is the same	15.588193893432617
14346/28840	You have told your coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo to drive round the walls and reenter by the Porta San Giovanni   These are my words	37.5974235534668
14347/28840	Impossible   Very dangerous to say the	203.27679443359375
14348/28840	Dangerousand why   On account of the famous Luigi V	269.91339111328125
14349/28840	Pray who may this famous Luigi Vampa be inquired Albert he may be very famous at Rome but I can assure you he is quite unknown at	98.99372863769531
14350/28840	What do you not know him   I have not that	19.743162155151367
14351/28840	You have never heard his name  	33.82558822631836
14352/28840	Well then he is a bandit compared to whom the Decesaris and the Gasparones were mere	125.65900421142578
14353/28840	Now then Albert cried Franz here is a bandit for you at	89.05846405029297
14354/28840	I forewarn you Signor Pastrini that I shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us having told you this	34.103599548339844
14355/28840	Once upon a time Well go	247.81451416015625
14356/28840	Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justicehe had had a great many Frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend	55.19091796875
14357/28840	But if your excellency doubt my veracity   Signor Pastrini returned Franz you are more susceptible than Cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your	61.51815414428711
14358/28840	Come sit down and tell us all about this Signor V	58.56135940551758
14359/28840	I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of Mastr	59.460906982421875
14360/28840	Because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the	147.9047088623047
14361/28840	On your honor is that true cried	103.43457794189453
14362/28840	Count returned Signor Pastrini hurt at Alberts repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions I do not say this to you but to your companion who knows Rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed	68.68529510498047
14363/28840	My dear fellow said Albert turning to Franz here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and doublebarrelled	54.54095458984375
14364/28840	Whilst Albert proposed this scheme Signor Pastrinis face assumed an expression impossible to	180.6478271484375
14365/28840	And pray asked Franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage   Not out of my armory for at Terracina I was plundered even of my hunting	111.63044738769531
14366/28840	And you   I shared the same fate at Aquapend	152.45089721679688
14367/28840	Do you know Signor Pastrini said Albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their	51.67279815673828
14368/28840	Doubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to Franz as the only one likely to listen with	127.92074584960938
14369/28840	Your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by	80.35015869140625
14370/28840	What cried Albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance   No for it would be	49.60961151123047
14371/28840	What could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you   Eh _parbleu_they should kill	146.8549346923828
14372/28840	The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say Your friend is decidedly	101.8123779296875
14373/28840	Albert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma Christi_ which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible	134.41934204101562
14374/28840	Well Signor Pastrini said Franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this Luigi V	52.76826477050781

14381/28840	_Pardieu_ cried Albert you are not a preacher to remain standing   The host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning Luigi V	56.647239685058594
14382/28840	What do you think of that Albertat twoandtwenty to be thus famous   Yes and at his age Alexander Cæsar and Napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind	55.04468536376953
14383/28840	So continued Franz the hero of this history is only twoandtwenty   Scarcely so	35.6192512512207

14438/28840	However as he was a favorite with Cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on	56.74724197387695

14443/28840	Cucumetto seemed to yield to his friends entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to Ritas father at Frosin	57.069156646728516

14452/28840	He inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of	80.88780212402344
14453/28840	A cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on	129.698486328125
14454/28840	One of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with Orvietto saying To the health of the brave Cucumetto and the fair	92.5695571899414
14455/28840	At this moment Carlini heard a womans cry he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry	84.42877960205078
14456/28840	After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket he found Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumet	35.6407585144043

14459/28840	A terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent but by degrees Carlinis features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his	95.31748962402344
14460/28840	Well said Cucumetto have you executed your commission   Yes captain returned Carlin	36.23543930053711

14463/28840	Now as I am not egotistical we will return to our comrades and draw lots for	46.98605728149414
14464/28840	You have determined then to abandon her to the common law said Carlin	117.56671142578125
14465/28840	Why should an exception be made in her favor   I thought that my entreaties   What right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception   It is	48.49003601074219
14466/28840	But never mind continued Cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will	61.17263412475586

14468/28840	20111m       Cucumetto departed without losing sight of Carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on Carlinis	48.7171516418457

14474/28840	The names of all including Carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of Diavolacc	63.102516174316406
14475/28840	He was the man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief and to whom Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his	56.54377365112305
14476/28840	A large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profuse	379.8164978027344
14477/28840	Diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by fortune burst into a loud	164.3485870361328

14480/28840	Well done Carlini cried the brigands that is acting like a good fellow and they all formed a circle round the fire while Diavolaccio	68.17362976074219
14481/28840	Carlini ate and drank as if nothing had	84.1738052368164
14482/28840	The bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard	207.8558807373047
14483/28840	They turned round and saw Diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his	23.9505558013916
14484/28840	Her head hung back and her long hair swept the	340.1885986328125
14485/28840	As they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolacc	45.154441833496094
14486/28840	This apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of Carlini who remained seated and ate and drank	78.91057586669922
14487/28840	Diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid Rita at the captains	91.59026336669922
14488/28840	Then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the band	33.5982666015625
14489/28840	A knife was plunged up to the hilt in Ritas left	114.95878601074219
14490/28840	Everyone looked at Carlini the sheath at his belt was	56.74359130859375
14491/28840	Ah ah said the chief I now understand why Carlini stayed	105.85723114013672
14492/28840	All savage natures appreciate a desperate	531.9324340820312
14493/28840	No other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what Carlini had	82.2678451538086
14494/28840	Now then cried Carlini rising in his turn and approaching the corpse his hand on the butt of one of his pistols does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me   No returned the chief she is th	70.5069351196289
14495/28840	Carlini raised her in his arms and carried her out of the circle of fire	68.93656158447266
14496/28840	Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the	37.77833557128906
14497/28840	At midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the	99.04618835449219
14498/28840	It was Ritas father who brought his daughters ransom in	201.5421142578125
14499/28840	Here said he to Cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my	28.201467514038086
14500/28840	But the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to	44.95822525024414
14501/28840	They both advanced beneath the trees through whose branches streamed the moon	272.0634460449219
14502/28840	Cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a	31.866565704345703
14503/28840	There said he demand thy child of Carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his	51.6372184753418
14504/28840	The old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his	88.67459106445312
14505/28840	At length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not	56.565643310546875
14506/28840	As he approached Carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old mans	35.792110443115234
14507/28840	A woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her as he raised his head the womans face became	57.11726379394531
14508/28840	The old man recognized his child and Carlini recognized the old	66.65138244628906
14509/28840	I expected thee said the bandit to Ritas	122.65467834472656
14510/28840	Wretch returned the old man what hast thou done and he gazed with terror on Rita pale and bloody a knife buried in her bos	128.9461212158203
14511/28840	A ray of moonlight poured through the trees and lighted up the face of the	52.516780853271484
14512/28840	Cucumetto had violated thy daughter said the bandit I loved her therefore I slew her for she would have served as the sport of the whole	79.42237854003906
14513/28840	The old man spoke not and grew pale as	383.1778564453125
14514/28840	Now continued Carlini if I have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in Ritas bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his	62.68840408325195
14515/28840	Thou hast done well returned the old man in a hoarse voice embrace me my	127.885986328125
14516/28840	20115m       Carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arms of his mistresss	39.46914291381836
14517/28840	These were the first tears the man of blood had ever we	157.10275268554688
14518/28840	Now said the old man aid me to bury my	80.81116485595703
14519/28840	Carlini fetched two pickaxes and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to rep	68.50421905517578
14520/28840	When the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the	178.06597900390625
14521/28840	Then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the	46.28080368041992
14522/28840	Then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was	91.9494400024414
14523/28840	Then extending his hand the old man said I thank you my son and now leave me	59.412330627441406
14524/28840	Carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the	76.66938018798828
14525/28840	It had been resolved the night before to change their encamp	187.4724884033203
14526/28840	An hour before daybreak Cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to	69.20759582519531
14527/28840	But Carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of Ritas	54.7882194519043
14528/28840	He went toward the place where he had left	32.45583724975586
14529/28840	He found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughters	68.96651458740234
14530/28840	He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the	77.5077896118164
14531/28840	But he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the Roman carbineers Carlini was	49.84305191040039
14532/28840	There was some surprise however that as he was with his face to the enemy he should have received a ball between his	86.56954193115234
14533/28840	That astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlinis rear when he	62.292625427246094
14534/28840	On the morning of the departure from the forest of Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated	78.09349822998047
14535/28840	They told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the	213.46522521972656
14536/28840	Thus from Fondi to Perusia everyone trembles at the name of Cucumet	99.5741958618164
14537/28840	These narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between Luigi and	429.657470703125
14538/28840	Time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of	91.54812622070312
14539/28840	They were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and	112.31744384765625
14540/28840	One day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards	67.96813201904297

14542/28840	The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question	179.1962127685547
14543/28840	That is very annoying said the brigadier for the man we are looking for is the	63.38181686401367
14544/28840	Cucumetto cried Luigi and Teresa at the same	31.97758674621582
14545/28840	Yes replied the brigadier and as his head is valued at a thousand Roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch	50.897647857666016
14546/28840	Five hundred Roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be	63.213253021240234
14547/28840	Yes it is very annoying said Vampa but we have not seen	26.06363296508789

14549/28840	Vampa then removed the stone and Cucumetto came	71.91614532470703
14550/28840	Through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their par	45.676513671875
14551/28840	He had read in the countenances of Luigi and Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold which he offered to	64.60243225097656
14552/28840	But Vampa raised his head proudly as to Teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of	103.10387420654297
14553/28840	Several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumet	95.77605438232422
14554/28840	The time of the Carnival was at	116.39088439941406
14555/28840	The Count of SanFelice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in Rome were	105.219970703125
14556/28840	Teresa had a great desire to see this	209.4730224609375
14557/28840	Luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the	130.3757781982422
14558/28840	The ball was given by the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter Carmela whom he ad	102.52385711669922
14559/28840	Carmela was precisely the age and figure of Teresa and Teresa was as handsome as Carm	230.11827087402344

14561/28840	Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant at holiday	167.8301544189453
14562/28840	They both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and	89.71998596191406
14563/28840	The _festa_ was magnificent not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the gardenwal	98.47138214111328

14567/28840	Four young men of the richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them with that Italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the	92.0831298828125
14568/28840	They were attired as peasants of Albano Velletri CivitaCastellana and	85.39459991455078
14569/28840	We need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and	129.9742431640625
14570/28840	Carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady	299.7054748535156
14571/28840	Carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her	157.13818359375
14572/28840	The Count of SanFelice pointed out Teresa who was hanging on Luigis arm in a group of	117.82295227050781
14573/28840	Will you allow me father said Carm	211.73513793945312
14574/28840	Certainly replied the count are we not in Carnival time   Carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her and saying a few words to him pointed with her finger to	58.657352447509766
14575/28840	The young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to Teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the counts	122.2751693725586
14576/28840	Teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at Luigi who could not refuse his ass	193.1889190673828
14577/28840	Luigi slowly relinquished Teresas arm which he had held beneath his own and Teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadr	225.03564453125
14578/28840	Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his	742.2208251953125
14579/28840	It was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart and then thrilled through his whole	85.7121353149414
14580/28840	He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his	160.41970825195312
14581/28840	Luigi was jealous   He felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition Teresa might escape	187.91497802734375
14582/28840	The young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered	491.6390686035156
14583/28840	We have said that Teresa was handsome but this is not all Teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegan	144.74618530273438
14584/28840	She had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the Count of SanFelices daughter we will not undertake to say that Carmela was not jealous of	45.8976936340332
14585/28840	And with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where Luigi awaited	122.4286117553711
14586/28840	Thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lovers	80.31150817871094
14587/28840	The quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition Carmela alone objecting to it but the Count of SanFelice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acc	59.77557373046875
14588/28840	One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had	59.49346160888672
14589/28840	The truth was that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed Teresa toward another part of the	162.0193328857422
14590/28840	Teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within	95.05696105957031
14591/28840	She herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching	157.8251953125
14592/28840	Why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were mer	113.81359100341797
14593/28840	However to Teresas great astonishment Luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the	164.30322265625
14594/28840	And what said your cavalier to you   He said it only depended on myself to have it and I had only one word to	61.92314910888672
14595/28840	Do you desire it as ardently as you say  	34.112823486328125
14596/28840	Well then you shall have it   The young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her	55.53736114501953
14597/28840	As Luigi spoke thus he left	475.0537109375

14599/28840	20121m       That night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the	68.65225219726562
14600/28840	The Villa of SanFelice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely Carm	137.89100646972656
14601/28840	Awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressinggown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the	78.04853057861328
14602/28840	When she recovered her father was by her	112.9844970703125
14603/28840	All the servants surrounded her offering her	463.2215881347656
14604/28840	An entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured   Her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen	121.79444885253906
14605/28840	Carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized	221.6858673095703

14607/28840	He came toward Teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous	85.55917358398438
14608/28840	The young girl was very pensive but seeing Luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a	144.89527893066406
14609/28840	Luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the gro	85.95410919189453
14610/28840	The young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfast	72.38224029541016
14611/28840	Teresa said Luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the counts	168.1508026123047
14612/28840	Yes replied Teresa with astonishment but I was mad to utter such a	77.23334503173828
14613/28840	And I replied Very well you shall have	88.91814422607422
14614/28840	Yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by Luigi but of course your reply was only to please	94.24285888671875
14615/28840	I have promised no more than I have given you Teresa said Luigi	100.97547912597656
14616/28840	Go into the grotto and dress	146.6352081298828
14617/28840	Teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking Luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressing	89.6562728881836
14618/28840	When he saw Luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward	53.877899169921875
14619/28840	Luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up	102.13194274902344
14620/28840	In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the cross	107.36746215820312
14621/28840	On arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to	77.48448181152344
14622/28840	That is your road excellency and now you cannot again	214.85281372070312
14623/28840	And here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of	93.79405212402344
14624/28840	Thank you said Luigi drawing back his hand I render a service I do not sell	124.44696807861328
14625/28840	Well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a	85.32344818115234
14626/28840	Then said the traveller take these two Venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of ear	64.18244934082031
14627/28840	And then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you will not find one better carved between Albano and CivitaCastell	55.594539642333984
14628/28840	I accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequ	53.10626983642578
14629/28840	For a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piast	177.5549774169922
14630/28840	What is your name inquired the	76.3231430053711
14631/28840	Luigi Vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied Alexander King of Maced	179.16407775878906
14632/28840	And yours   I said the traveller am called Sinbad the	47.13612747192383
14633/28840	Yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to Vampa as his	72.11978149414062
14634/28840	Well and what may you have to say against this name inquired Albert it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth I must	67.87741088867188
14635/28840	The name of Sinbad the Sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the Count of Monte Cristo on the previous	41.05592727661133
14636/28840	Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had	66.32662963867188
14637/28840	As he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a	30.803190231323242
14638/28840	He listened to know whence this sound could	363.864990234375
14639/28840	A moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced	188.36021423339844
14640/28840	He bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the	78.29346466064453
14641/28840	Three cries for help came more distinctly to his	352.8680114746094
14642/28840	He cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off Teresa as Nessus the centaur carried Deian	227.40716552734375
14643/28840	This man who was hastening towards the wood was already threequarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the	49.250125885009766
14644/28840	Vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking	90.47823333740234
14645/28840	The young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then	66.03850555419922
14646/28840	The ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with Teresa in his	129.63015747070312

14648/28840	Vampa then rushed towards Teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrot	78.31507873535156
14649/28840	Fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome	235.2168426513672
14650/28840	When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded	53.14363479614258
14651/28840	He had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of	91.6156005859375
14652/28840	Vampa approached the corpse and recognized Cucumet	64.0554428100586
14653/28840	From the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of Teresa and had sworn she should be	58.79140090942383
14654/28840	Vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary Teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her	111.44742584228516
14655/28840	Suddenly Vampa turned toward his mistress   Ah said hegood good You are dressed it is now my turn to dress	91.62249755859375
14656/28840	20125m       Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of SanFelices	33.85185623168945
14657/28840	Vampa took Cucumettos body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn Teresa remained	120.20377349853516

14659/28840	He would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of Florian and would have declared on reaching Paris that he had met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the Sabine	68.37577056884766
14660/28840	At the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no less elegant than that of	38.08858108520508
14661/28840	Vampa in this attire resembled a painting by Léopold Robert or Schn	154.9332733154297
14662/28840	He had assumed the entire costume of Cucumet	23.95920181274414
14663/28840	The young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his	46.38380432128906
14664/28840	Now he said to Teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be   Oh yes exclaimed the young girl	43.98725891113281
14665/28840	And follow me wherever I go   To the worlds	126.24788665771484

14668/28840	They went towards the forest and soon entered	140.7615509033203

14672/28840	Teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance she endeavored to repress her	147.4854736328125

14690/28840	Yes but I came to ask something more than to be your	36.224830627441406
14691/28840	And what may that be inquired the bandits with aston	123.94862365722656
14692/28840	I come to ask to be your captain said the young	30.771833419799805
14693/28840	And what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the	99.4290542602539
14694/28840	I have killed your chief Cucumetto whose dress I now wear and I set fire to the villa SanFelice to procure a weddingdress for my betrot	43.25719451904297
14695/28840	An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain vice Cucumetto	120.74365997314453
14696/28840	20129m       Well my dear Albert said Franz turning towards his friend what think you of citizen Luigi Vampa   I say he is a myth replied Albert and never had an	33.181358337402344
14697/28840	And what may a myth be inquired Pastr	165.43441772460938
14698/28840	The explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied	152.30421447753906
14699/28840	And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of Rome   And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an	51.93541717529297
14700/28840	Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him   Why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the Tiber and the smugglers of the	55.260494232177734
14701/28840	And how does he behave towards travellers   Alas his plan is very	180.30007934570312
14702/28840	It depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hours	157.12762451171875
14703/28840	At the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoners brains with a pistolshot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the	108.4712142944336
14704/28840	Well Albert inquired Franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall   Quite so said Albert if the way be pictures	49.08308410644531
14705/28840	The clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman	83.85651397705078
14706/28840	Excellencies said he the coach is	99.91307067871094
14707/28840	Well then said Franz let us to the Colosse	21.280414581298828
14708/28840	By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets your excellencies   By the streets _morbleu_ by the streets cried	43.078216552734375
14709/28840	Ah my dear fellow said Albert rising and lighting his third cigar really I thought you had more	120.76812744140625
14710/28840	So saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the	32.60486602783203
14711/28840	The Colosseum   Franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to	105.01696014404297
14712/28840	This itinerary possessed another great advantagethat of leaving Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor Pastrinis story in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so strangely mixed	114.64778900146484
14713/28840	Seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of	131.7143096923828
14714/28840	The carriage stopped near the Meta Sudans the door was opened and the young men eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a _cicerone_ who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his	70.28089904785156
14715/28840	As for Albert and Franz they essayed not to escape from their _ciceronian_ tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their	65.43414306640625
14716/28840	Thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conduct	127.0106201171875
14717/28840	All at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself	102.36377716064453
14718/28840	Conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to Franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery	180.72967529296875
14719/28840	The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like Franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the	230.2810516357422
14720/28840	And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some	180.62767028808594
14721/28840	By a sort of instinctive impulse Franz withdrew as much as possible behind his	117.40727233886719
14722/28840	About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with	106.62334442138672
14723/28840	The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz stood in a kind of halflight that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made	171.03286743164062
14724/28840	He wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broadbrimmed	269.0440979003906
14725/28840	The lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black	421.0282287597656
14726/28840	20135m       From the imperfect means Franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusionthat the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of	120.12882995605469
14727/28840	The man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the Transtevere	96.73162078857422
14728/28840	I beg your excellencys pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the Roman dialect but I dont think Im many minutes after my time ten oclock has just struck by the clock of Saint John Later	60.778778076171875
14729/28840	Say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest Tuscan tis I who am too	151.22132873535156
14730/28840	But even if you had caused me to wait a little while I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of	54.44402313232422
14731/28840	Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man I came here direct from the Castle of	85.56786346435547

14733/28840	And who is Beppo   Oh Beppo is employed in the prison and I give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss	58.61577606201172
14734/28840	Indeed You are a provident person I	174.5119171142578
14735/28840	Why you see no one knows what may	43.58761978149414
14736/28840	Perhaps some of these days I may be entrapped like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of	68.80218505859375
14737/28840	Briefly what did you learn   That two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two oclock as is customary at Rome at the commencement of all great	78.7200698852539
14738/28840	One of the culprits will be _mazzolato_3 he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest	55.920101165771484
14739/28840	The other sufferer is sentenced to be _decapitato_4 and he your excellency is poor Pepp	41.217838287353516
14740/28840	The fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an	162.06190490722656
14741/28840	But Peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with	128.47801208496094
14742/28840	Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and	368.0251159667969
14743/28840	Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise them	332.6967468261719
14744/28840	My good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant	118.063720703125
14745/28840	Perhaps I am but one thing I have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served	90.65434265136719
14746/28840	I should hate and despise myself as a coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extrem	225.40528869628906
14747/28840	That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than	100.22981262207031
14748/28840	And what is your excellencys project   Just	29.69029426574707
14749/28840	I will so advantageously bestow 2000 piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for Peppino and during that year another skilfully placed 1000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his	124.05937194824219
14750/28840	And do you feel sure of succeeding   _Pardieu_ exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in	49.04327392578125
14751/28840	What did your excellency say inquired the	56.92459487915039
14752/28840	I said my good fellow that I would do more singlehanded by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses	99.7181167602539
14753/28840	Leave me then to act and have no fears for the	109.03640747070312
14754/28840	At least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should	95.98553466796875
14755/28840	Take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I	111.29867553710938
14756/28840	Remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work	58.21642303466797
14757/28840	And what of that Is not a day divided into twentyfour hours each hour into sixty minutes and every minute subdivided into sixty seconds Now in 86400 seconds very many things can be	328.8186950683594
14758/28840	And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or	50.18709182739258
14759/28840	I have engaged the three lower windows at the Café Rospoli should I have obtained the requisite pardon for Peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on	94.59394073486328
14760/28840	And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution   Send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and I will give it to	72.9843521118164
14761/28840	Your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not   Nay I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the	38.56079864501953
14762/28840	Well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to	190.4949493408203
14763/28840	Have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for I may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when I in my turn may require your aid and	167.89178466796875
14764/28840	Tis some travellers who are visiting the Colosseum by torch	84.74124145507812
14765/28840	Well then if you obtain the reprieve   The middle window at the Café Rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a red	58.439178466796875
14766/28840	And if you fail   Then all three windows will have yellow draper	104.72337341308594
14767/28840	And then   And then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and I further promise you to be there as a spectator of your	58.49911880493164
14768/28840	Adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as I do upon	52.507118225097656
14769/28840	Saying these words the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to Franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of	95.44729614257812
14770/28840	The next minute Franz heard himself called by Albert who made the lofty building reecho with the sound of his friends	133.27130126953125
14771/28840	Franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his	114.39451599121094
14772/28840	Franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had	92.60659790039062
14773/28840	And the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer Sinbad the	104.27904510498047
14774/28840	As we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another	313.90283203125
14775/28840	In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of	190.2263641357422
14776/28840	Worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till	144.04898071289062
14777/28840	Like a genuine Frenchman Albert had employed his time in arranging for the evenings diversion he had sent to engage a box at the Teatro Argentina and Franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the	91.09447479248047
14778/28840	Yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more seriousminded companion would have taken weeks to	135.43380737304688
14779/28840	Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the Teatro Argentina and also what performers appeared in	79.44844055175781
14780/28840	The opera of _Parisina_ was announced for representation and the principal actors were Coselli Moriani and La Specch	130.11338806152344
14781/28840	The young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of _Lucia di Lammermoor_ supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of	139.03482055664062
14782/28840	Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general	95.65519714355469
14783/28840	It was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling	128.2744598388672
14784/28840	The Carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to	115.89118194580078
14785/28840	With this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate	61.2169303894043
14786/28840	The truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival with the Holy Week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the	132.9179229736328
14787/28840	Towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom Franz had been introduced in Paris where indeed he had imagined she still	119.9100341796875
14788/28840	And her name is   Countess	46.54234313964844
14789/28840	Ah I know her by name exclaimed Albert she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as	171.7939910888672
14790/28840	I was to have been presented to her when I met her at Madame Villeforts	55.947383880615234
14791/28840	Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence asked	178.5529022216797
14792/28840	At that instant the countess perceived Franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the	76.52517700195312
14793/28840	Upon my word said Albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful count	42.05190658569336
14794/28840	Is there indeed my good fellow Pray tell me is it sympathy of heart   No of taste continued Franz grave	115.27764892578125
14795/28840	And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced   By the countesss visiting the Colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly	64.73656463623047
14796/28840	You were with her then   I	58.65595626831055
14797/28840	20143m       And you will probably find your theme illch	45.956111907958984
14798/28840	But said Albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the	158.37774658203125
14799/28840	Are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks   Certainly directly the curtain falls on the	76.4660873413086
14800/28840	What a confounded long time this first act	396.0924072265625
14801/28840	I believe on my soul that they never mean to finish	95.15364074707031
14802/28840	Oh yes they will only listen to that charming	145.23435974121094
14803/28840	But what an awkward inelegant fellow he	239.3332977294922
14804/28840	At least you must admire Morianis style and	1463.177734375
14805/28840	I never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a wom	168.60501098632812
14806/28840	My good friend said Franz turning to him while Albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to	116.62382507324219
14807/28840	This important task was just completed as they arrived at the countesss	138.40443420410156
14808/28840	At the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the Italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other	84.13239288330078
14809/28840	Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew	162.84754943847656
14810/28840	Franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up Alberts glass and began in his turn to survey the	126.85368347167969
14811/28840	Sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a Greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national	138.73269653320312
14812/28840	Behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to	77.8298568725586
14813/28840	Franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and Albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair Albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either	245.4908447265625
14814/28840	All I can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at Rome since the beginning of the season for I saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a	78.19332122802734
14815/28840	Sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black	86.40289306640625
14816/28840	And what do you think of her personal appearance   Oh I consider her perfectly lovelyshe is just my idea of what Medora must have	109.40128326416016
14817/28840	Franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with Albert while Franz returned to his previous survey of the house and	97.97576141357422
14818/28840	Of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial	219.4072723388672
14819/28840	The ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted	352.0950622558594
14820/28840	The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though Franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single	93.97128295898438
14821/28840	The curtain rose and the attention of Franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the	81.76226043701172
14822/28840	Most of my readers are aware that the second act of _Parisina_ opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina while sleeping betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for U	130.2747344970703
14823/28840	The injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy until conviction seizes on his mind and then in a frenzy of rage and indignation he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his	170.00697326660156
14824/28840	This duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Doniz	149.68740844726562
14825/28840	Excited beyond his usual calm demeanor Franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the halfuttered bravos expired on his	163.5332489013672
14826/28840	All doubt of his identity was now at an end his singular host evidently resided at	204.4715576171875
14827/28840	Perhaps you never before noticed him   What a questionso truly French Do you not know that we Italians have eyes only for the man we love   True replied	119.47018432617188
14828/28840	How ghastly pale he is   Oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said	83.68842315673828
14829/28840	Then you know him almost screamed the count	118.80040740966797
14830/28840	Oh pray do for heavens sake tell us all aboutis he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what   I fancy I have seen him before and I even think he recognizes	116.76716613769531
14831/28840	And I can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget	64.77751159667969
14832/28840	The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and mis	240.7759246826172
14833/28840	This fresh allusion to Byron5 drew a smile to Franzs countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before	78.78123474121094
14834/28840	I must positively find out who and what he is said Franz rising from his	117.9771728515625
14835/28840	No no cried the countess you must not leave	36.08391189575195
14836/28840	I depend upon you to escort me	150.80885314941406
14837/28840	Oh indeed I cannot permit you to	79.72798156738281
14838/28840	Is it possible whispered Franz that you entertain any fear   Ill tell you answered the count	77.6822509765625
14839/28840	Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen	76.40026092529297
14840/28840	The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before	145.8989715576172
14841/28840	Oh he is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect The coalblack hair large bright glittering eyes in which a wild unearthly fire seems burningthe same ghastly pal	155.8253173828125
14842/28840	Then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her	313.1711730957031
14843/28840	Nobody knows who she is or where she comes	475.384765625
14844/28840	No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical	186.5788116455078
14845/28840	I entreat of you not to go near himat least tonight and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will but tonight you neither can nor	162.84597778320312
14846/28840	For that purpose I mean to keep you all to	176.96905517578125
14847/28840	Franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many	179.2898712158203
14848/28840	Listen to me said the countess and do not be so very head	51.06040573120117
14849/28840	I have a party at my house tonight and therefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the	77.80692291259766
14850/28840	Now I cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for	142.1462860107422
14851/28840	There was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his	72.68899536132812
14852/28840	Franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the	159.38351440429688
14853/28840	Upon arriving at her hotel Franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the	133.6382293701172
14854/28840	Excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions halfreproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and I longed to be alone that I might compose my startled	137.88397216796875
14855/28840	Nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and I am sure it does not spring from your	61.120147705078125
14856/28840	What is it   Promise me I	52.2110595703125
14857/28840	I will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man	201.15403747558594
14858/28840	I have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is	71.21844482421875
14859/28840	Where he comes from I am ignorant but I can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least	73.47117614746094
14860/28840	Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said	102.48919677734375
14861/28840	Well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man	77.1103286743164
14862/28840	There are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet	548.6267700195312
14863/28840	For heavens sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and	110.00090789794922
14864/28840	Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of	124.94375610351562
14865/28840	And now goodnight go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this	121.83534240722656
14866/28840	For my own part I am quite sure I shall not be able to close my	27.89832878112793
14867/28840	So saying the countess quitted Franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were	214.59857177734375
14868/28840	Upon his return to the hotel Franz found Albert in his dressinggown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a	109.58621215820312
14869/28840	My dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you Why I did not expect to see you before	95.41980743408203
14870/28840	My dear Albert replied Franz I am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning Italian	99.18693542480469
14871/28840	I should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this	119.57212829589844
14872/28840	Upon my soul these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them ar	233.76596069335938
14873/28840	Why herethey give you their handthey press yours in returnthey keep up a whispering conversationpermit you to accompany them	429.16973876953125
14874/28840	Why if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone	228.14801025390625
14875/28840	And the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the _si_ as Dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to	141.02967834472656
14876/28840	Besides you must have perceived that the countess was really	74.44271850585938
14877/28840	I can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced finelooking fellowadmirably	165.4442901611328
14878/28840	Indeed I feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a firstrate Paris tailorprobably Blin or Hum	125.8363037109375
14879/28840	He was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished	174.4377899169922
14880/28840	Franz smiled for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own	175.37998962402344
14881/28840	Well that tends to confirm my own ideas said Franz that the countesss suspicions were destitute alike of sense and	143.50167846679688
14882/28840	Did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his words   I did but they were uttered in the Romaic	73.374267578125
14883/28840	I knew that from the mixture of Greek	138.4186248779297
14884/28840	I dont know whether I ever told you that when I was at college I was ratherrather strong in	64.57341766357422
14885/28840	He spoke the Romaic language did he   I think	72.09925842285156
14886/28840	What do you say   Nothing	28.675561904907227
14887/28840	But tell me what were you thinking about when I came in   Oh I was arranging a little surprise for	51.588233947753906
14888/28840	Of what nature   Why you know it is quite impossible to procure a	51.77214431762695
14889/28840	Certainly and I also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get	78.2640151977539
14890/28840	Now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my	274.5107116699219
14891/28840	Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his	47.594749450683594
14892/28840	Franz cried Albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just	72.16749572753906
14893/28840	And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you	121.81832122802734
14894/28840	You agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question   I	76.83941650390625
14895/28840	Neither can we procure horses   True we have offered any sum but have	197.2100372314453
14896/28840	Well now what do you say to a cart I dare say such a thing might be	73.02518463134766
14897/28840	And a pair of oxen   As easily found as the	209.49249267578125
14898/28840	Then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be	116.49699401855469
14899/28840	The cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by Léopold	123.46250915527344
14900/28840	It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrent	97.51625061035156
14901/28840	Our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a	177.15200805664062
14902/28840	Albert I am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital	109.58485412597656
14903/28840	And quite a national one too replied Albert with gratified	347.62066650390625
14904/28840	A mere masque borrowed from our own	419.5085754394531
14905/28840	Ha ha ye Romans you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly	188.3998260498047
14906/28840	But you dont know us when we cant have one thing we invent	119.07002258300781
14907/28840	And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody   Only to our	245.3675079345703
14908/28840	Upon my return home I sent for him and I then explained to him what I wished to	60.08409118652344
14909/28840	He assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all I	176.0093994140625
14910/28840	One thing I was sorry for when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superflu	86.06103515625
14911/28840	And where is he now   Who   Our	68.2052001953125
14912/28840	Gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too	127.09761810302734
14913/28840	Then he will be able to give us an answer	65.20639038085938
14914/28840	At this instant the door opened and the head of Signor Pastrini	17.084095001220703
14915/28840	Now then asked Albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen   Better than that replied Signor Pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with	79.87677001953125
14916/28840	Take care my worthy host said Albert _better_ is a sure enemy to _well	189.66635131835938
14917/28840	Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned Signor Pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self	46.16403579711914
14918/28840	But what _have_ you done asked	300.9073181152344
14919/28840	When then the Count of Monte Cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the Palazzo Rosp	41.96261978149414
14920/28840	The friends looked at each other with unutterable	34.38904571533203
14921/28840	But do you think asked Albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger   What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo asked Franz of his	46.6193962097168
14922/28840	A very great nobleman but whether Maltese or Sicilian I cannot exactly say but this I know that he is noble as a Borghese and rich as a gold	157.41424560546875
14923/28840	He would have writtenor   At this instant someone knocked at the	59.45106506347656
14924/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive	61.548702239990234
14925/28840	Faith Franz whispered Albert there is not much to find fault with	140.21182250976562
14926/28840	Tell the count replied Franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on	51.611507415771484
14927/28840	That is what I call an elegant mode of attack said Albert You were quite correct in what you said Signor Pastr	70.71676635742188
14928/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo is unquestionably a man of firstrate breeding and knowledge of the	35.56572341918945
14929/28840	Then you accept his offer said the	173.65716552734375
14930/28840	What say you Franz   Oh I agree with you the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided	46.8057861328125
14931/28840	Franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would	158.82119750976562
14932/28840	The next day must clear up every doubt and unless his near neighbor and wouldbe friend the Count of Monte Cristo possessed the ring of Gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this	132.91241455078125
14933/28840	Eight oclock found Franz up and dressed while Albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly	288.2001647949219
14934/28840	The first act of Franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequious	116.9998550415039
14935/28840	Pray Signor Pastrini asked Franz is not some execution appointed to take place today   Yes your excellency but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too	61.641658782958984
14936/28840	Very possibly I may not go answered Franz but in case I feel disposed give me some particulars of todays	191.68797302246094
14937/28840	What particulars would your excellency like to hear   Why the number of persons condemned to suffer their names and description of the death they are to	88.73799896240234
14938/28840	That happens just lucky your excellency Only a few minutes ago they brought me the _tavolettas	97.74626922607422
14939/28840	What are they   Sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of	136.93711853027344
14940/28840	The reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere	136.68946838378906
14941/28840	And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked Franz somewhat incred	204.31454467773438
14942/28840	Upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part Signor Pastrini cried	32.30044174194336
14943/28840	Why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency I think I may take upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor	79.04603576660156
14944/28840	I see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever I	115.71774291992188
14945/28840	Meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these _tavolettas	55.15059280395508
14946/28840	Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencys wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber I have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your	54.60176467895508
14947/28840	John Lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit Luigi Vampa and his	65.88831329345703
14948/28840	The firstnamed malefactor will be _mazzolato_ the second culprit _decapitato	58.390682220458984
14949/28840	The prayers of all good Christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please God to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their	149.13775634765625
14950/28840	This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the Colosse	30.659530639648438
14951/28840	No part of the programme differedthe names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous	186.07627868652344
14952/28840	Time was getting on however and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken Albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the	122.17084503173828
14953/28840	The anticipated delights of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual	105.96995544433594
14954/28840	Now my excellent Signor Pastrini said Franz addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo   Most assuredly replied	33.572479248046875
14955/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo is always an early riser and I can answer for his having been up these two	44.281158447265625
14956/28840	Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly   20155m       Oh I am quite	25.0250186920166
14957/28840	I will take all the blame on myself if you find I have led you into an	126.68399810791016
14958/28840	Well then if it be so are you ready Albert   Perfect	106.76803588867188
14959/28840	Let us go and return our best thanks for his	168.16653442382812
14960/28840	The landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said   _I signori Francesi	104.90115356445312
14961/28840	The domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to	290.6416320800781
14962/28840	They passed through two rooms furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini and were shown into an elegantly fittedup drawing	67.5028076171875
14963/28840	The richest Turkey carpets covered the floor and the softest and most inviting couches easychairs and sofas offered their highpiled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refresh	280.54119873046875
14964/28840	Splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the	132.39486694335938
14965/28840	If your excellencies will please to be seated said the man I will let the count know that you are	51.88852310180664
14966/28840	And with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried _portières	57.40559768676758
14967/28840	As the door opened the sound of a _guzla_ reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to	81.92488098144531
14968/28840	Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the	46.20379638671875
14969/28840	Everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid	185.36851501464844
14970/28840	Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times count returned Albert you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached	84.2787094116211
14971/28840	Indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit	39.1302604675293
14972/28840	It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini that I did not sooner assist you in your	74.00724029541016
14973/28840	He did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as I am I seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my	76.08238220214844
14974/28840	As soon as I learned I could in any way assist you I most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my	178.20741271972656
14975/28840	He resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the	130.20965576171875
14976/28840	Moreover he had this advantage he was master of the counts secret while the count had no hold on Franz who had nothing to	79.79963684082031
14977/28840	However he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his	123.78797149658203
14978/28840	Count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the Rospoli	40.91386413574219
14979/28840	Stay I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this perhaps I can render you this slight service	116.88660430908203
14980/28840	He extended his hand and rang the bell thr	50.439781188964844
14981/28840	Did you ever occupy yourself said he to Franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants I	73.07764434814453
14982/28840	When I ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my stewardthus I do not waste a minute or a	98.53076171875
14983/28840	A man of about fortyfive or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced Franz into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize	103.49739074707031
14984/28840	It was evident he had his	59.55744171142578
14985/28840	Monsieur Bertuccio said the count you have procured me windows looking on the Piazza del Popolo as I ordered you	23.759702682495117
14986/28840	Yes excellency returned the steward but it was very	20.66852378845215
14987/28840	Did I not tell you I wished for one replied the count frown	44.4718132019043
14988/28840	And your excellency has one which was let to Prince Lobanieff but I was obliged to pay a hundred   That will dothat will do Monsieur Bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domestic	72.8056869506836
14989/28840	You have the window that is	117.09960174560547
14990/28840	Give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to	62.59642791748047
14991/28840	The steward bowed and was about to quit the	45.11638641357422
14992/28840	Ah continued the count be good enough to ask Pastrini if he has received the _tavoletta_ and if he can send us an account of the	35.41741943359375
14993/28840	There is no need to do that said Franz taking out his tablets for I saw the account and copied it	120.00859069824219
14994/28840	Let us know when breakfast is	718.515380859375
14995/28840	These gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will I trust do me the honor to breakfast with me   But my dear count said Albert we shall abuse your	42.7512321472168
14996/28840	Not at all on the contrary you will give me great	32.84852600097656
14997/28840	You will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at	147.78726196289062
14998/28840	He then took Franzs tablets out of his	111.7192611694336
14999/28840	John Lateran and Peppino called Rocca Priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa and the men of his	41.75065612792969
15000/28840	Hum The first will be _mazzolato_ the second _decapitato	26.03598976135254
15001/28840	Yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but I think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the	59.83552169799805
15002/28840	Yes I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosis and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two	91.07913970947266
15003/28840	No replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for Peppino called Rocca Pri	31.994028091430664
15004/28840	You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the _mazzolata_ still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very	77.12864685058594
15005/28840	The _mandaïa_6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the Count of Chalais and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless recommended the suff	120.86467742919922
15006/28840	Ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of European punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of	82.37599182128906
15007/28840	Really count replied Franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the	69.65507507324219
15008/28840	There are at least few that I have not seen said the count cold	56.220054626464844
15009/28840	And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles   My first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third	359.6026611328125
15010/28840	I do not quite understand you replied Franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest	120.9397964477539
15011/28840	Listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any	97.72478485107422
15012/28840	I will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by	256.6194152832031
15013/28840	And remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eyes of the	111.46847534179688
15014/28840	No no continued the count had I to avenge myself it is not thus I would take	83.99198150634766
15015/28840	Then you disapprove of duelling You would not fight a duel asked Albert in his turn astonished at this strange	148.61917114257812
15016/28840	But said Franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the	91.19921112060547
15017/28840	Hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter dra	363.1543273925781
15018/28840	As he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying   _Al suo commodo_   The two young men arose and entered the breakfast	62.001651763916016
15019/28840	As for the count he just touched the dishes he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate	133.79074096679688
15020/28840	This brought back to Franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the Countess G and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a	56.780670166015625
15021/28840	At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his	54.265586853027344
15022/28840	Well said the count what are you doing   You must excuse us count returned Franz but we have still much to	26.951393127441406
15023/28840	What may that be   We have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure	47.70719528198242
15024/28840	Do not concern yourself about that we have I think a private room in the Piazza del Popolo I will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress	71.15564727783203
15025/28840	Opposite the scaffold   The scaffold forms part of the _fête	41.660400390625
15026/28840	But I warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the	61.82324981689453
15027/28840	You will describe it to me replied Franz and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed	59.83863067626953
15028/28840	Besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at Paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see	76.20855712890625
15029/28840	_Diable_ when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a	123.86466217041016
15030/28840	If you went to Spain would you not see the bullfights Well suppose it is a bullfight you are going to see Recollect the ancient Romans of the Circus and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred	91.62821960449219
15031/28840	Think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughters and the charming Vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said Come despatch the	181.071533203125
15032/28840	Shall you go then Albert asked	147.69793701171875
15033/28840	_Ma foi_ yes like you I hesitated but the counts eloquence decides	118.1135025024414
15034/28840	Let us go then said Franz since you wish it but on our way to the Piazza del Popolo I wish to pass through the Cor	23.872112274169922
15035/28840	Is this possible count   On foot yes in a carriage	474.7762756347656
15036/28840	Is it important that you should go that way   Yes there is something I wish to	37.43852233886719
15037/28840	Well we will go by the Cor	45.343814849853516
15038/28840	We will send the carriage to wait for us on the Piazza del Popolo by the Via del Babuino for I shall be glad to pass myself through the Corso to see if some orders I have given have been	35.357818603515625
15039/28840	Excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to	61.62164306640625
15040/28840	Ah yes returned the count I know who he is gentlemen will you return to the salon you will find good cigars on the centre	116.80520629882812
15041/28840	The young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another	111.71138000488281
15042/28840	Albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the Café de Paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable _puros	75.63463592529297
15043/28840	Such was Alberts opinion of the count and as Franz well knew that Albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change	117.51274108886719
15044/28840	But said he did you observe one very singular thing   What   How attentively he looked at	54.601951599121094
15045/28840	Ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising I have been more than a year absent from Paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a	97.58490753173828
15046/28840	The first opportunity you have undeceive him I beg and tell him I am nothing of the	74.66039276123047
15047/28840	Franz smiled an instant after the count	207.24119567871094
15048/28840	I am now quite at your service gentlemen said	42.46566390991211
15049/28840	The carriage is going one way to the Piazza del Popolo and we will go another and if you please by the Cor	28.56521224975586
15050/28840	Take some more of these cigars	207.26402282714844
15051/28840	With all my heart returned Albert Italian cigars are	462.29107666015625
15052/28840	When you come to Paris I will return all	74.00029754638672
15053/28840	I will not refuse I intend going there soon and since you allow me I will pay you a	92.74955749511719
15054/28840	Come we have not any time to lose it is halfpast twelvelet us set	58.14964294433594
15055/28840	All three descended the coachman received his masters orders and drove down the Via del Babu	55.554443359375
15056/28840	Which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could	77.4920883178711
15057/28840	The three last returned he with a negligence evidently unaffected for he could not imagine with what intention the question was	177.7169189453125
15058/28840	Franz glanced rapidly towards the three	258.4422302246094
15059/28840	The side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red	74.6417007446289
15060/28840	The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the	39.77857208251953
15061/28840	Preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with	288.3722839355469
15062/28840	The masks could not appear the carriages could not move about but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the	106.10652923583984
15063/28840	Franz Albert and the count continued to descend the Cor	76.90282440185547
15064/28840	At the corner of the street they met the counts steward who was awaiting his	35.26189041137695
15065/28840	The window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the Via del Babuino and the Monte Pinc	90.6956787109375
15066/28840	It consisted as we have said of a small dressingroom opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite	81.67037963867188
15067/28840	On chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white sat	268.501220703125
15068/28840	Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the	60.583351135253906
15069/28840	It was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotinewe say guillotine because the Roman _mandaïa_ is formed on almost the same model as the French	72.89948272705078
15070/28840	7 The knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the	186.3588409423828
15071/28840	Two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the	298.4183349609375
15072/28840	Their repast consisted apparently of bread and saus	301.4073791503906
15073/28840	One of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his	125.2923583984375
15074/28840	These two men were the executioners	104.64905548095703
15075/28840	At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his	135.44517517089844
15076/28840	A double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred	79.6341323852539
15077/28840	All the rest of the square was paved with	105.77220916748047
15078/28840	Many women held their infants on their shoulders and thus the children had the best	209.68959045410156
15079/28840	What the count said was truethe most curious spectacle in life is that of	171.579345703125
15080/28840	And yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the	130.10556030273438
15081/28840	It was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the	40.88461685180664
15082/28840	Suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church	112.88831329345703
15083/28840	A brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the	184.7991943359375
15084/28840	20169m       Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and	57.119659423828125
15085/28840	He was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge	84.75053405761719
15086/28840	He had moreover sandals bound on his feet by	569.0934448242188
15087/28840	Behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first Peppino and then	44.82936096191406
15088/28840	Peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited	255.6026153564453
15089/28840	Each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to	85.71271514892578
15090/28840	At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under	238.9727020263672
15091/28840	He looked at Alberthe was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked	128.21759033203125
15092/28840	The count alone seemed unmovednay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale	174.39869689941406
15093/28840	His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jack	96.87767791748047
15094/28840	And yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as Franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and	193.19149780273438
15095/28840	However the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became	179.58387756347656
15096/28840	Peppino was a handsome young man of four or fiveandtwenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would	62.181396484375
15097/28840	Andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be	505.6360778808594
15098/28840	In prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and	122.37362670898438
15099/28840	I thought said Franz to the count that you told me there would be but one	56.540374755859375
15100/28840	I told you true replied he cold	159.4662322998047
15101/28840	Yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many years to	98.98924255371094
15102/28840	If the pardon is to come there is no time to	48.00434112548828
15103/28840	And see here it is said the	53.9488639831543
15104/28840	At the moment when Peppino reached the foot of the _mandaïa_ a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded	48.82548904418945
15105/28840	The piercing eye of Peppino had noticed	117.84813690185547
15106/28840	A pardon for Peppino called Rocca Priori said the principal fri	26.61318588256836
15107/28840	And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to	71.30254364013672
15108/28840	For Peppino cried Andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been	44.897090911865234
15109/28840	Why for him and not for me We ought to die	118.22969055175781
15110/28840	I was promised he should die with	135.76622009277344
15111/28840	You have no right to put me to death	57.155052185058594
15112/28840	I will not die aloneI will not   And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his	106.08953094482422
15113/28840	The executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized	41.84463119506836
15114/28840	What is going on asked Franz of the count for as all the talk was in the Roman dialect he had not perfectly understood	61.936553955078125
15115/28840	Here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to dielike a coward it is true but he was about to die without	53.43906784057617
15116/28840	Honor to man this masterpiece of nature this king of the creation   And the count burst into a laugh a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to	110.59828186035156

15133/28840	Well asked he of the count what has then happened   Nothing replied the count only as you see the Carnival has	69.13948059082031
15134/28840	In fact said Franz this horrible scene has passed away like a	138.26821899414062
15135/28840	It is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed	173.4962615966797
15136/28840	He profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied	118.48682403564453
15137/28840	Decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical	130.93081665039062
15138/28840	Albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished	183.03663635253906
15139/28840	Well Albert said Franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels Come answer	175.55360412597656
15140/28840	But I am really glad to have seen such a sight and I understand what the count saidthat when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any	88.92628479003906
15141/28840	20175m       Without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is	66.74746704101562
15142/28840	It must be allowed that Andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel Come dress yourselves gentlemen dress	260.718505859375
15143/28840	Franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions	132.4230194091797

15151/28840	They saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and	96.90313720703125

15164/28840	Franz thanked the count for his	206.50135803222656
15165/28840	As for Albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that was passing near	119.22745513916016

15168/28840	Well I am convinced they are all charming	215.54513549804688
15169/28840	How unfortunate that you were masked Albert said Franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappoint	208.74423217773438
15170/28840	Oh replied he half laughing half serious I hope the Carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the	206.58517456054688
15171/28840	But in spite of Alberts hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of Roman	62.46279525756836
15172/28840	At one of these encounters accidentally or purposely Alberts mask fell	129.9895477294922
15173/28840	He instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the	72.73025512695312
15174/28840	Doubtless one of the charming females Albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of vio	73.88407897949219
15175/28840	Albert seized it and as Franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered Albert to retain	104.68917846679688
15176/28840	Albert placed it in his buttonhole and the carriage went triumphantly	49.49200439453125
15177/28840	Well said Franz to him there is the beginning of an	54.82807159423828

15181/28840	The jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when Albert and Franz again encountered the carriage with the _contadini_ the one who had thrown the violets to Albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button	88.15998077392578
15182/28840	Bravo bravo said Franz things go	1188.611572265625

15186/28840	Albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring	149.5128631591797
15187/28840	Then they returned to the Rospoli Palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had	35.74745178222656

15191/28840	Signor Pastrini came to the door to receive his	29.372785568237305
15192/28840	The count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the	85.79911804199219
15193/28840	Franz questioned Albert as to his intentions but Albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if Signor Pastrini could procure him a	115.01087188720703

15197/28840	The host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which Franz and Albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their	143.58901977539062

15199/28840	The two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the Count of Monte Cristos table and that of Signor Pastr	26.8376407623291
15200/28840	Truth compelled Franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on Pastrinis	80.39338684082031
15201/28840	During dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the	224.3509063720703

15207/28840	Her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived Franz and Albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to	89.7671890258789

15231/28840	The count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace  	30.90230369567871

15238/28840	This morning he made two or three exits worthy of Didier or	237.15745544433594

15240/28840	This circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their	73.02400207519531

15256/28840	The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with	112.49202728271484
15257/28840	At halfpast one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of Franz and	78.69597625732422

15265/28840	On his return from the Vatican Franz carefully avoided the Corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profan	156.61268615722656

15270/28840	He had made up his mind to write to her the next	32.15959167480469
15271/28840	Franz remarked while he gave these details that Albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask	76.2149887084961
15272/28840	He insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other	163.527099609375
15273/28840	Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next	128.95822143554688
15274/28840	Albert attributed to Franzs absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her	254.2306365966797
15275/28840	Franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his	76.91632843017578
15276/28840	He therefore promised Albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the Carnival from the windows of the Rospoli	55.20344924926758
15277/28840	The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous ep	109.80082702636719
15278/28840	This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rosecolored sat	83.90531158447266

15282/28840	Albert was not deceived for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one	132.58236694335938

15289/28840	I think so also replied Albert and I very much fear you will go alone to the Duke of Braccianos	34.90989303588867
15290/28840	Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman	199.56503295898438
15291/28840	All the nobility of Rome will be present and if your fair _incognita_ belong to the higher class of society she must go	67.82418823242188

15303/28840	Doubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was	206.0908660888672
15304/28840	Alberts love had not taken away his	122.3272476196289
15305/28840	He hastened with Franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after	189.69131469726562
15306/28840	After dinner the Count of Monte Cristo was	18.5335636138916
15307/28840	They had not seen him for two	38.287899017333984
15308/28840	Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to Civita Vecch	68.375244140625
15309/28840	He had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour	68.44169616699219
15310/28840	Whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody	206.9761199951172
15311/28840	The man was an enigma to	95.49331665039062
15312/28840	The count must feel sure that Franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between	127.00934600830078
15313/28840	On his side however great Franzs desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning	108.54086303710938
15314/28840	The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the Argentina Theatre and were told they were all	66.88111114501953
15315/28840	In consequence he brought them the key of his ownat least such was the apparent motive of his	153.3899383544922
15316/28840	Franz and Albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the Palli Theatre the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if they did not profit by	60.04909133911133
15317/28840	This assurance determined the two friends to accept	268.49737548828125
15318/28840	Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the counts pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first	85.83197784423828
15319/28840	He could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pall	81.94144439697266
15320/28840	Truly a Byronic hero Franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon Manfreds shoulders or beneath Laras	226.10964965820312
15321/28840	He was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at	58.095821380615234
15322/28840	And to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the English poet the count seemed to have the power of	80.12564086914062
15323/28840	Albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a	117.07933044433594
15324/28840	Franz was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domine	235.68467712402344
15325/28840	He thought several times of the project the count had of visiting Paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect	107.4308090209961
15326/28840	And yet he did not wish to be at Paris when the count was	43.076595306396484
15327/28840	The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and convers	132.31446838378906
15328/28840	As similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated Albert on his	182.75440979003906

15330/28840	The heroine of the bouquet kept her word she gave Albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day	139.97828674316406
15331/28840	At length Tuesday came the last and most tumultuous day of the	233.0129852294922
15332/28840	On Tuesday the theatres open at ten oclock in the morning as Lent begins after eight at	87.62461853027344
15333/28840	On Tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the Carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and	152.1742706298828

15335/28840	The author of this history who has resided five or six years in Italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other	96.6314468383789
15336/28840	Albert was triumphant in his harlequin	97.97347259521484
15337/28840	A knot of rosecolored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the	54.620540618896484
15338/28840	In order that there might be no confusion Franz wore his peasants	376.83343505859375
15339/28840	As the day advanced the tumult became	348.6830139160156

15342/28840	At three oclock the sound of fireworks let off on the Piazza del Popolo and the Piazza di Venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to	47.942481994628906
15343/28840	The races like the _moccoli_ are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the	40.52513885498047
15344/28840	At the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent	118.69090270996094
15345/28840	All these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the	75.05230712890625
15346/28840	The pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were	195.4368133544922
15347/28840	A detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the _barberi	109.50566864013672
15348/28840	When the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was	60.54551696777344
15349/28840	Almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horses excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like	102.83255004882812
15350/28840	Then the Castle of Saint Angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had	350.1782531738281
15351/28840	Immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the Corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite	289.52496337890625
15352/28840	A new source of noise and movement was added to the	303.67559814453125
15353/28840	The sellers of _moccoletti_ entered on the	48.392581939697266
15354/28840	The _moccoletto_ is like life man has found but one means of transmitting it and that one comes from	62.00880432128906

15356/28840	The _moccoletto_ is kindled by approaching it to a	38.063907623291016
15357/28840	But who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the _moccoletto_the gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman	110.16231536865234
15358/28840	Everyone hastened to purchase _moccoletti_Franz and Albert among the	26.85361671447754
15359/28840	The night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of _Moccoletti_ repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the	72.65877532958984

15361/28840	It seemed like the _fête_ of Jackolantern	38.5634765625
15362/28840	It is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen	48.839263916015625

15366/28840	This battle of folly and flame continued for two hours the Corso was light as day the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were	166.84097290039062
15367/28840	Every five minutes Albert took out his watch at length it pointed to	118.90474700927734
15368/28840	The two friends were in the Via dei Pontef	80.6714859008789
15369/28840	Albert sprang out bearing his _moccoletto_ in his	24.387746810913086
15370/28840	Two or three masks strove to knock his _moccoletto_ out of his hand but Albert a firstrate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of San Giac	63.835147857666016
15371/28840	The steps were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each others	168.74423217773438
15372/28840	Franz followed Albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first	62.89289474487305
15373/28840	Instantly a mask wearing the wellknown costume of a peasant woman snatched his _moccoletto_ from him without his offering any	78.17982482910156
15374/28840	Franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw Albert disappear arminarm with the peasant	206.91622924804688
15375/28840	He watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the Via Mace	37.865570068359375
15376/28840	Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the Carnival sounded and at the same instant all the _moccoletti_ were extinguished as if by	38.114051818847656
15377/28840	It seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished	191.83181762695312

15380/28840	It seemed as though Rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast	175.95997619628906
15381/28840	By a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oclock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest	91.29977416992188
15382/28840	The distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the Hôtel de Lond	33.11376953125
15383/28840	Dinner was waiting but as Albert had told him that he should not return so soon Franz sat down without	136.606201171875
15384/28840	Signor Pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had	53.836612701416016
15385/28840	The sudden extinction of the _moccoletti_ the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in Franzs mind a certain depression which was not free from uneas	50.195804595947266
15386/28840	He therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted	77.8355712890625
15387/28840	Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as	186.7861328125
15388/28840	He ordered the carriage therefore for eleven oclock desiring Signor Pastrini to inform him the moment that Albert returned to the	49.623844146728516
15389/28840	At eleven oclock Albert had not come	38.412296295166016
15390/28840	Franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the Duke of Braccian	43.53664016723633
15391/28840	Franz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling	110.0995101928711
15392/28840	Franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the _moccoli_ and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Mace	15.670358657836914
15393/28840	Then he has not returned said the d	41.1449089050293

15396/28840	I think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid	74.68655395507812
15397/28840	And dont you know where he is   Not at	30.55394172668457
15398/28840	Is he armed   He is in mas	59.248863220214844
15399/28840	You should not have allowed him to go said the duke to Franz you who know Rome better than he	51.335723876953125
15400/28840	Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquiet	69.28350830078125
15401/28840	I informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the night here duke said Franz and desired them to come and inform me of his	64.2806167602539

15403/28840	The duke was not mistaken when he saw Franz the servant came up to	52.16855239868164
15404/28840	Your excellency he said the master of the Hôtel de Londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the Viscount of Morcer	15.804853439331055

15410/28840	Shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the count	62.89547348022461
15411/28840	Yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise I cannot answer as to what I may do	101.88231658935547
15412/28840	Be prudent in any event said the count	69.43815612792969
15413/28840	Franz took his hat and went away in	63.85285949707031

15415/28840	He had no doubt that it was the messenger from	61.69632339477539
15416/28840	The man was wrapped up in a large	87.54398345947266
15417/28840	He went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed	80.04006958007812
15418/28840	What wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his	60.771968841552734
15419/28840	Are not you the person who brought me a letter inquired Franz from the Viscount of Morcerf   Your excellency lodges at Pastrinis hotel   I	31.570091247558594
15420/28840	Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount   I	28.50031280517578
15421/28840	Your excellencys name   Is the Baron Franz dÉpin	12.813101768493652
15422/28840	20199m       Then it is to your excellency that this letter is	15.048125267028809
15423/28840	Is there any answer inquired Franz taking the letter from	89.32470703125
15424/28840	Come upstairs with me and I will give it to	27.55567169189453
15425/28840	I prefer waiting here said the messenger with a	75.77275085449219
15426/28840	And why   Your excellency will know when you have read the	24.28534698486328
15427/28840	Shall I find you here then  	65.0406265258789
15428/28840	On the staircase he met Signor Pastr	26.59027862548828
15429/28840	You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of	63.55384063720703
15430/28840	Yes I have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to	39.438411712646484
15431/28840	Light the candles in my apartment if you	76.4238052368164
15432/28840	The innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a	115.6258544921875
15433/28840	The young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read Alberts letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded	64.52075958251953
15434/28840	It was written and signed by	126.22001647949219
15435/28840	Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it	291.26025390625
15436/28840	Run to Torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to the	92.9512710571289
15437/28840	It is urgent that I should have this money without	89.93771362304688
15438/28840	I do not say more relying on you as you may rely on	36.996612548828125
15439/28840	Your friend   Albert de Morcer	12.854596138000488
15440/28840	_If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven oclock the Count Albert will have ceased to live	95.80670166015625
15441/28840	This second signature explained everything to Franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment the street was safer for	130.9438018798828
15442/28840	Albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to	64.26364135742188
15443/28840	He hastened to open the _secrétaire_ and found the pocketbook in the drawer and in it the letter of	44.87823486328125
15444/28840	There were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand Albert had already expended three	86.30126953125
15445/28840	As to Franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at Florence and had only come to Rome to pass seven or eight days he had brought but a hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty	75.373046875
15446/28840	Thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert	62.05459213256836
15447/28840	True he might in such a case rely on the kindness of Signor Torl	48.57416915893555
15448/28840	He was therefore about to return to the Palazzo Bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his	63.772865295410156
15449/28840	He remembered the Count of Monte Crist	9.375836372375488
15450/28840	Franz was about to ring for Signor Pastrini when that worthy presented	52.92356491088867
15451/28840	My dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within   Yes your excellency he has this moment	36.58811950683594
15452/28840	Is he in bed   I should say	49.30220413208008
15453/28840	Then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an	53.17201614379883
15454/28840	Signor Pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes after he said   The count awaits your excell	39.26735305786133
15455/28840	Franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the	97.71289825439453
15456/28840	He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with div	53.8387451171875
15457/28840	Well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup with me It would be very kind of	88.02888488769531
15458/28840	No I have come to speak to you of a very serious	28.002954483032227
15459/28840	A serious matter said the count looking at Franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be   Are we alone   Yes replied the count going to the door and	49.52595138549805
15460/28840	Did you see the postscript   I did	29.307415008544922
15461/28840	_Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte Alberto avrà cessato di vive	190.89041137695312
15462/28840	What think you of that inquired	139.64208984375
15463/28840	Have you the money he demands   Yes all but eight hundred piast	58.537288665771484
15464/28840	The count went to his _secrétaire_ opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to Franz I hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but	60.77576446533203
15465/28840	You see on the contrary I come to you first and instantly replied	104.4267807006836
15466/28840	And I thank you have what you will and he made a sign to Franz to take what he	61.034000396728516
15467/28840	Is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to Luigi Vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the	52.39404296875
15468/28840	I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said	70.45124816894531
15469/28840	How so returned the count with	72.24238586425781
15470/28840	If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa I am sure he would not refuse you Alberts	44.90416717529297
15471/28840	The count knit his brows and remained silent an	129.4962921142578
15472/28840	And if I went to seek Vampa would you accompany me   If my society would not be disagree	53.97924041748047
15473/28840	It is a lovely night and a walk without Rome will do us both	198.41729736328125
15474/28840	Shall I take any arms   For what purpose   Any money   It is	47.96517562866211
15475/28840	Where is the man who brought the letter   In the	30.264135360717773
15476/28840	He awaits the answer  	47.41268539428711
15477/28840	I must learn where we are	52.0919189453125
15478/28840	It is useless he would not come	121.84387969970703
15479/28840	To your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering	150.53683471679688
15480/28840	The count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar	56.58614730834961
15481/28840	The man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the	31.3878116607666
15482/28840	_Salite_ said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his	55.20050048828125
15483/28840	The messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the	131.38497924804688
15484/28840	Ah it is you Peppino said the	25.311965942382812
15485/28840	But Peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the counts hand and covered it with	34.144840240478516
15486/28840	Ah said the count you have then not forgotten that I saved your life that is strange for it is a week	53.80108642578125
15487/28840	20203m       No excellency and never shall I forget it returned Peppino with an accent of profound	26.98201560974121
15488/28840	Never That is a long time but it is something that you believe	43.48112487792969
15489/28840	Oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my	28.429304122924805
15490/28840	You allow me to give you this title continued the count in French it is necessary to excite this mans	61.00251770019531
15491/28840	You can speak before me said Franz I am a friend of the	43.42695999145508
15492/28840	I am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to	37.53013610839844
15493/28840	How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigis hands   Excellency the Frenchmans carriage passed several times the one in which was	106.21586608886719
15494/28840	The Frenchman threw her a bouquet Teresa returned itall this with the consent of the chief who was in the	174.5196533203125
15495/28840	What cried Franz was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman peasants   It was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied Pepp	41.294677734375
15496/28840	Well then the Frenchman took off his mask Teresa with the chiefs consent did the	255.60675048828125
15497/28840	The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous Teresa gave him oneonly instead of Teresa it was Beppo who was on the steps of the church of San Giac	61.01797103881836
15498/28840	What exclaimed Franz the peasant girl who snatched his _mocoletto_ from him   Was a lad of fifteen replied Pepp	66.6524658203125
15499/28840	But it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived Beppo has taken in plenty of	91.17129516601562
15500/28840	And Beppo led him outside the walls said the	119.0006103515625
15501/28840	Exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Mace	34.16942596435547
15502/28840	Beppo got in inviting the Frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked	191.43075561523438
15503/28840	He gallantly offered the righthand seat to Beppo and sat by	215.54061889648438
15504/28840	Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from Rome the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the	76.15846252441406
15505/28840	The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the Frenchman became somewhat too forward Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the	83.78724670410156
15506/28840	At the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the Almo surrounded the	82.18687438964844
15507/28840	The Frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled Beppo but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to	130.49588012695312
15508/28840	They made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to Teresa and Luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of	57.82083511352539
15509/28840	Well said the count turning towards Franz it seems to me that this is a very likely	28.351699829101562
15510/28840	What do you say to it   Why that I should think it very amusing replied Franz if it had happened to anyone but poor	38.43894958496094
15511/28840	And in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious	100.35013580322266
15512/28840	And shall we go and find him inquired	129.73960876464844
15513/28840	He is in a very picturesque placedo you know the catacombs of	79.23207092285156
15514/28840	Sebastian   I was never in them but I have often resolved to visit	151.23956298828125
15515/28840	Well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a	79.40117645263672
15516/28840	Have you a carriage  	40.13467788696289
15517/28840	That is of no consequence I always have one ready day and	257.7889404296875
15518/28840	I am a very capricious being and I should tell you that sometimes when I rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night I resolve on starting for some particular point and away I	81.95125579833984
15519/28840	The count rang and a footman	108.54437255859375
15520/28840	Order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the hol	95.98951721191406
15521/28840	You need not awaken the coachman Ali will	127.4804916381836
15522/28840	In a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the	31.846088409423828
15523/28840	We might start at five oclock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infid	90.67037963867188
15524/28840	Are you still resolved to accompany me   More determined than	72.78919982910156
15525/28840	Franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by Pepp	49.19282913208008
15526/28840	At the door they found the	43.509613037109375
15527/28840	Ali was on the box in whom Franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Crist	51.99119567871094
15528/28840	Franz and the count got into the	35.52273178100586
15529/28840	Peppino placed himself beside Ali and they set off at a rapid	94.30525970458984
15530/28840	Ali had received his instructions and went down the Corso crossed the Campo Vaccino went up the Strada San Gregorio and reached the gates of	83.29420471191406
15531/28840	The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way and bordered with tom	198.22654724121094
15532/28840	From time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise Franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from Pepp	78.64836883544922
15533/28840	A short time before they reached the Baths of Caracalla the carriage stopped Peppino opened the door and the count and Franz alight	48.16448211669922
15534/28840	In ten minutes said the count to his companion we shall be	42.138065338134766
15535/28840	He then took Peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and Peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the	58.907657623291016
15536/28840	Five minutes elapsed during which Franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the Campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous	169.6457977294922
15537/28840	Now said the count let us follow	25.38672637939453
15538/28840	Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small	43.55605697631836
15539/28840	They then perceived two men conversing in the	111.33370971679688
15540/28840	Ought we to go on asked Franz of the count or should we pause   Let us go on Peppino will have warned the sentry of our	78.36917114257812
15541/28840	One of the two men was Peppino and the other a bandit on the	29.853540420532227
15542/28840	Franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted	58.10798645019531
15543/28840	Your excellency said Peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at	49.33562088012695
15544/28840	They came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely	47.259185791015625
15545/28840	Peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage	170.0869140625
15546/28840	Peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after	104.97105407714844
15547/28840	The count first reached an open space and Franz followed him	227.14358520507812
15548/28840	The passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still Franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one	205.53912353515625
15549/28840	They went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by Who comes there At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine	68.225341796875
15550/28840	A friend responded Peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might	47.547874450683594
15551/28840	Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty	65.27710723876953
15552/28840	Franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary	122.72786712646484
15553/28840	Five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catac	111.02510833740234
15554/28840	Down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were	101.82476806640625
15555/28840	The count laid his hand on Franzs	146.96946716308594
15556/28840	Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he	99.15251159667969
15557/28840	Peppino obeyed and Franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since Peppino had put out his torch was visible along the	87.22637939453125
15558/28840	They advanced silently the count guiding Franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the	75.58319091796875
15559/28840	Franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a	151.4658966064453
15560/28840	Three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a	193.0176544189453
15561/28840	These arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have	101.83087921142578
15562/28840	In the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted	116.31005096435547
15563/28840	A lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the	76.22799682617188
15564/28840	A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the newcomers contemplated	84.37408447265625
15565/28840	This was the chief of the band Luigi V	52.77787780761719
15566/28840	Around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within	123.21208953857422

15568/28840	Who comes there cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamplight a shadow approaching his	109.38328552246094
15569/28840	At this challenge Vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his gird	58.830352783203125
15570/28840	In a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the	114.72138977050781
15571/28840	Well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear Vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of	60.43666076660156
15572/28840	It seems that your memory is equally short in everything Vampa said the count and that not only do you forget peoples faces but also the conditions you make with	127.7337417602539
15573/28840	What conditions have I forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair	49.1680793762207
15574/28840	Why did you not tell me all thisyou inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his	113.16436004638672
15575/28840	Are you not alone asked Vampa with uneas	43.30012893676758
15576/28840	I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom I desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his	46.66170883178711
15577/28840	Come your excellency the count added turning to Franz here is Luigi Vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has	66.26043701171875
15578/28840	Franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet	327.9559020996094
15579/28840	Welcome among us your excellency he said to him you heard what the count just said and also my reply let me add that I would not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friends ransom that this had	61.25614547729492
15580/28840	But said Franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscountI do not see	45.62485885620117
15581/28840	Nothing has happened to him I hope said the count frown	40.78425216674805
15582/28840	The prisoner is there replied Vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and I will go myself and tell him he is	45.03092575073242
15583/28840	The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Alberts prison and Franz and the count followed	64.03772735595703
15584/28840	What is the prisoner doing inquired Vampa of the sent	52.51699447631836
15585/28840	_Ma foi_ captain replied the sentry I do not know for the last hour I have not heard him	55.42399978637695
15586/28840	The count and Franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a	129.47325134277344
15587/28840	Then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound sl	56.02515411376953
15588/28840	Come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oclock tomorrow	31.129980087280273
15589/28840	Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of	54.10637664794922
15590/28840	You are right your excellency he said this must be one of your	26.15251922607422
15591/28840	Then going to Albert he touched him on the shoulder saying Will your excellency please to awaken   Albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his	53.01811981201172
15592/28840	Oh said he is it you captain You should have allowed me to	67.84709167480469
15593/28840	I was dancing the galop at Torlonias with the Countess	67.07929229736328
15594/28840	Then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time	62.89943313598633
15595/28840	Why the devil do you rouse me at this hour   To tell you that you are free your excell	22.33332633972168
15596/28840	My dear fellow replied Albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future Napoleons maxim Never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on I should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my	98.05905151367188
15597/28840	So then they have paid my ransom   No your excell	27.903818130493164
15598/28840	Well then how am I free   A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand	83.26808166503906
15599/28840	Really Then that person is a most amiable	214.27066040039062
15600/28840	What said he is it you my dear Franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed   No not I replied Franz but our neighbor the Count of Monte Crist	52.44938659667969
15601/28840	My dear Albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at Torlon	61.956138610839844
15602/28840	You may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no illwill to Signor Luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a	183.44537353515625
15603/28840	You are decidedly right and we may reach the Palazzo by two o	49.7636833190918
15604/28840	Signor Luigi continued Albert is there any formality to fulfil before I take leave of your excellency   None sir replied the bandit you are as free as	60.66105270385742
15605/28840	Well then a happy and merry life to	143.40078735351562
15606/28840	And Albert followed by Franz and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in	137.65353393554688
15607/28840	Peppino said the brigand chief give me the	154.30848693847656
15608/28840	What are you going to do inquired the	18.574308395385742
15609/28840	I will show you the way back myself said the captain that is the least honor that I can render to your excell	56.511348724365234
15610/28840	And taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes	104.65058898925781
15611/28840	And now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has	40.5984992980957
15612/28840	No my dear Vampa replied the count besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed	91.60248565673828
15613/28840	20214m       Gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young men perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever I may be you shall be	59.011932373046875
15614/28840	The count went out first then	359.79888916015625
15615/28840	Has your excellency anything to ask me said Vampa with a	25.748973846435547
15616/28840	Yes I have replied Franz I am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we	78.37126922607422
15617/28840	Cæsars _Commentaries_ said the bandit it is my favorite	70.88716125488281
15618/28840	Yes replied Franz here I am and he in his turn left the	81.50756072998047
15619/28840	Ah your pardon said Albert turning round will you allow me captain   And he lighted his cigar at Vampas	95.77454376220703
15620/28840	Now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we	48.005287170410156
15621/28840	I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Braccian	37.50057601928711
15622/28840	They found the carriage where they had left	53.118770599365234
15623/28840	The count said a word in Arabic to Ali and the horses went on at great	132.42398071289062
15624/28840	It was just two oclock by Alberts watch when the two friends entered into the dancing	54.33355712890625
15625/28840	Their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on Alberts account ceased	116.89781188964844
15626/28840	And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of	72.80548095703125
15627/28840	In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to	44.223236083984375
15628/28840	My very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exert	88.58808135986328
15629/28840	I am wholly a stranger to Parisit is a city I have never yet	56.217586517333984
15630/28840	Is it possible exclaimed Albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world I can scarcely credit	94.12564086914062
15631/28840	So distinguished an individual as yourself cried Albert could scarcely have required an	261.0838928222656
15632/28840	You are most kind but as regards myself I can find no merit I possess save that as a millionaire I might have become a partner in the speculations of	97.26946258544922
15633/28840	Rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks I stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into	308.08575439453125
15634/28840	Your offer however smooths all difficulties and I have only to ask you my dear	70.83032989501953
15635/28840	Connected by marriage you mean said Franz laugh	287.1187744140625
15636/28840	Well never mind how it is answered Albert it comes to the same thing in the	66.56451416015625
15637/28840	Then it is settled said the count and I give you my solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that I have long med	77.47701263427734
15638/28840	And in three months time said Albert you will be at my house   Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my	84.11093139648438
15639/28840	Day for day hour for hour said Albert that will suit me to a	213.84573364257812
15640/28840	So be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimneypiece he said today is the 21st of February and drawing out his watch added it is exactly halfpast ten o	46.13901138305664
15641/28840	Now promise me to remember this and expect me the 21st of May at the same hour in the fore	70.40909576416016
15642/28840	Capital exclaimed Albert your breakfast shall be	223.9226531982422
15643/28840	Where do you live  	31.191726684570312
15644/28840	Have you bachelors apartments there I hope my coming will not put you to any	141.05987548828125
15645/28840	I reside in my fathers house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main	96.34449005126953
15646/28840	Quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down	215.00294494628906
15647/28840	27 Rue du Helder 21st May halfpast ten in the	54.65571594238281
15648/28840	Now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than	124.61900329589844
15649/28840	Shall I see you again ere my departure asked	131.34864807128906
15650/28840	That depends when do you leave   Tomorrow evening at five o	112.29988098144531
15651/28840	In that case I must say adieu to you as I am compelled to go to Naples and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday	115.3969955444336
15652/28840	And you baron pursued the count addressing Franz do you also depart tomorrow  	122.77867126464844
15653/28840	For France   No for Venice I shall remain in Italy for another year or	60.161155700683594
15654/28840	Then we shall not meet in Paris   I fear I shall not have that	33.16632080078125
15655/28840	Well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant	93.82209777832031
15656/28840	It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a	72.92549133300781
15657/28840	20219m       Let us understand each other said Albert it is agreedis it notthat you are to be at	38.73426055908203

15659/28840	The young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the	39.414913177490234
15660/28840	What is the matter asked Albert of Franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly	54.97632598876953
15661/28840	I will confess to you Albert replied Franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehens	47.94106674194336
15662/28840	My dear fellow exclaimed Albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness Why you must have lost your	64.73246002197266
15663/28840	Whether I am in my senses or not answered Franz that is the way I	55.54859161376953
15664/28840	Listen to me Franz said Albert I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to	86.74742889404297
15665/28840	Have you anything particular against him  	217.50985717773438
15666/28840	Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither   I	131.94796752929688
15667/28840	And where   Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to tell you   I	28.88056755065918
15668/28840	Upon your honor   Upon my	52.14158630371094
15669/28840	Franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two Corsican bandits with	48.65318298339844
15670/28840	He dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the _Thousand and One Nights	27.30692481994629
15671/28840	Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum between the count and Vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit Peppinoan engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully	76.02272033691406
15672/28840	Albert listened with the most profound	62.188480377197266
15673/28840	Well said he when Franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related The count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his	154.63287353515625
15674/28840	Go but to Portsmouth or Southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the English as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this	116.83177947998047
15675/28840	Still persisted Franz I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your	136.5791015625
15676/28840	My dear Franz replied Albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the counts assistance you promptly went to him saying My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger help me to deliver	108.38182830810547
15677/28840	Was not that nearly what you said   20222m       It	15.85867977142334
15678/28840	Well then did he ask you Who is	258.3830871582031
15679/28840	Albert de Morcerf how does he come by his namehis fortune what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he a native Tell me did he put all these questions to you   I confess he asked me	108.69623565673828
15680/28840	No he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa where I can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern I did not very particularly care to	70.82830810546875
15681/28840	And this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on Alberts	95.04412841796875
15682/28840	Well said Franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of ref	89.91657257080078
15683/28840	Still in spite of all you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular person	23.777523040771484
15684/28840	He is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and	139.25257873535156
15685/28840	If my vote and interest can obtain it for him I will readily give him the one and promise the	149.17929077148438
15686/28840	And now my dear Franz let us talk of something	46.84908676147461
15687/28840	Come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to	137.515625
15688/28840	Peters   Franz silently assented and the following afternoon at halfpast five oclock the young men	135.0186767578125

15690/28840	The Guests   In the house in the Rue du Helder where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do honor to the	45.03093338012695
15691/28840	Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants	80.42305755615234
15692/28840	Two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the	122.56352996826172
15693/28840	Between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and Countess of Morcer	65.65028381347656
15694/28840	A high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage	121.91822052001953

15696/28840	It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscounts age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for	123.5262222290039
15697/28840	There were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded	104.83824157714844
15698/28840	By means of the two windows looking into the street Albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thorough	111.51892852783203
15699/28840	Then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination Albert de Morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the _concierges_ door and which merits a particular	96.2696762084961
15700/28840	It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the welloiled hinges and locks told quite another	162.0391845703125

15861/28840	Precisely asked Debray taking out his	214.13694763183594
15862/28840	Oh you will give me five minutes grace replied Morcerf for I also expect a pres	50.09693908691406
15863/28840	What shall we do said Debray we have only one Monthyon	35.565635681152344
15864/28840	Well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said Beauchamp that is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the	58.55546569824219
15865/28840	And where does he come from asked Debr	49.717620849609375
15866/28840	You have already answered the question once but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second	82.11448669433594
15867/28840	Really said Albert I do not know when I invited him three months ago he was then at Rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone   And you think him capable of being exact demanded Debr	61.649742126464844
15868/28840	Well with the five minutes grace we have only ten	137.50047302246094
15869/28840	I will profit by them to tell you something about my	92.09656524658203
15870/28840	I beg pardon interrupted Beauchamp are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us   Yes and for a most curious	51.394065856933594
15871/28840	Go on then for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning and I must make up for	54.329036712646484
15872/28840	I was at Rome during the last	87.18458557128906
15873/28840	Yes but what you do not know is that I was carried off by	50.246070861816406
15874/28840	Yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for I found them ugly enough to frighten	132.42201232910156
15875/28840	Come my dear Albert said Debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes and that like Madame de Maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a	91.20143127441406
15876/28840	Say so at once we are sufficiently wellbred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to	119.14300537109375
15877/28840	And I say to you fabulous as it may seem I tell it as a true one from beginning to	134.6025848388672
15878/28840	The brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the Catacombs of Saint	122.54991912841797
15879/28840	I know it said ChâteauRenaud I narrowly escaped catching a fever	52.2335090637207
15880/28840	And I did more than that replied Morcerf for I caught	62.45254898071289
15881/28840	I was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4000 Roman crownsabout 24000 franc	79.3687744140625
15882/28840	I was at the end of my journey and of my	45.493228912353516
15883/28840	But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns said ChâteauRen	22.924806594848633
15884/28840	A man whose name is Franz dÉpinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring	28.70216178894043
15885/28840	No he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to	131.62371826171875
15886/28840	Ah this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus a Perseus freeing	365.395751953125
15887/28840	No he is a man about my own	83.51118469238281
15888/28840	Armed to the teeth   He had not even a knittingneed	102.21778869628906
15889/28840	But he paid your ransom   He said two words to the chief and I was	85.34456634521484
15890/28840	And they apologized to him for having carried you off said Beauch	81.03547668457031
15891/28840	No his name is the Count of Monte Crist	9.23046875
15892/28840	There is no Count of Monte Cristo said Debr	13.971628189086914
15893/28840	I do not think so added ChâteauRenaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the European nobility	20.94131851196289
15894/28840	Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo   He comes possibly from the Holy Land and one of his ancestors possessed Calvary as the Mortemarts did the Dead	123.28714752197266
15895/28840	I think I can assist your researches said Maximil	25.530258178710938
15896/28840	Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employeda grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean an atom in the	128.08627319335938
15897/28840	Well he of whom I speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of count somewhere in Tusc	103.10332489013672
15898/28840	He is rich then   I believe	21.357908248901367
15899/28840	Which means   Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those	23.665935516357422
15900/28840	He has even a name taken from the book since he calls himself Sinbad the Sailor and has a cave filled with	71.79851531982422
15901/28840	And you have seen this cavern Morcerf asked Beauch	36.858951568603516
15902/28840	No but Franz has for heavens sake not a word of this before	175.02786254882812
15903/28840	Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strump	180.52882385253906
15904/28840	Only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of	121.92961120605469
15905/28840	The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to sayAre you mad or are you laughing at us   And I also said Morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named Penel	53.68067169189453
15906/28840	Ah cried Albert it is very lucky that	74.60494232177734
15907/28840	Morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth   My dear Albert said Debray what you tell us is so	51.78288269042969
15908/28840	Ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of themthey have no	188.47718811035156
15909/28840	They are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who	130.9886474609375
15910/28840	Now you get angry and attack our poor	313.6145324707031
15911/28840	How will you have them protect you The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely	181.47882080078125
15912/28840	Will you be ambassador Albert I will send you to	148.7156524658203
15913/28840	No lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali the Sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle	201.63670349121094
15914/28840	Yes said Albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the Count of Monte Crist	18.694244384765625
15915/28840	Doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an Arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and Greek mist	217.38645935058594
15916/28840	Have you seen the Greek mistress   I have both seen and heard	78.47418212890625
15917/28840	I saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when I breakfasted with the	88.86799621582031
15918/28840	He eats then   Yes but so little it can hardly be called	157.33740234375
15919/28840	Laugh if you will the Countess G who knew Lord Ruthven declared that the count was a	87.3794937133789
15920/28840	For a man not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous seaserpent of the _Constitutionnel	95.87630462646484
15921/28840	Wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said Debray facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexception	255.5672607421875
15922/28840	Just so Lucien returned Morcerf you have described him feature for	83.05445861816406
15923/28840	This man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution I thought I should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the	76.16917419433594
15924/28840	Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your blood asked Beauch	39.0772590637207
15925/28840	Or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birthright   Rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said Morcerf somewhat piqu	167.24864196777344
15926/28840	When I look at you Parisians idlers on the Boulevard de Gand or the Bois de Boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same	33.928733825683594
15927/28840	At the same time added ChâteauRenaud your Count of Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the Italian banditt	27.535634994506836
15928/28840	There are no Italian banditti said Debr	77.06952667236328
15929/28840	No Count of Monte Cristo added Debr	13.951683044433594
15930/28840	20243m       Confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued Beauch	31.089801788330078
15931/28840	But the sound of the clock had not died away when Germain announced His excellency the Count of Monte Crist	26.00800895690918
15932/28840	The involuntary start everyone gave proved how much Morcerfs narrative had impressed them and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden	434.1638488769531
15933/28840	He had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiseless	47.6387939453125
15934/28840	The count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his	147.06739807128906
15935/28840	Every article of dresshat coat gloves and bootswas from the first	574.0444946289062
15936/28840	But what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had	222.14797973632812
15937/28840	The count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached Albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial	52.63265609741211
15938/28840	Punctuality said Monte Cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns I think but it is not the same with	87.51876831054688
15939/28840	However I hope you will excuse the two or three seconds I am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in France where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postil	77.1133804321289
15940/28840	My dear count replied Albert I was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom I now present to	62.42396545410156
15941/28840	They are the Count of ChâteauRenaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the Round Table	52.334327697753906
15942/28840	Lucien Debray private secretary to the minister of the interior	42.12874221801758
15943/28840	Beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the French government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in Italy since his paper is prohibited there and	111.79259490966797
15944/28840	At this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale	112.11058807373047
15945/28840	You wear the uniform of the new French conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome	54.36946105957031
15946/28840	No one could have said what caused the counts voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he	171.72117614746094
15947/28840	You have never seen our Africans count said	48.379432678222656
15948/28840	Never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself	94.24371337890625
15949/28840	Well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole	90.26763916015625
15950/28840	And we have just heard continued Albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although I have seen him today for the first time I request you to allow me to introduce him as my	48.42881774902344
15951/28840	At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show	287.55950927734375
15952/28840	Ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the	21.164297103881836
15953/28840	This exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to what Albert was saying surprised everybody and especially Morrel who looked at Monte Cristo with	101.18846893310547
15954/28840	But at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at	97.17511749267578
15955/28840	20245m       Why should he doubt it said Beauchamp to ChâteauRen	12.154505729675293
15956/28840	In reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in Monte Cristo Albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular	76.6359634399414
15957/28840	What say you Morrel   _Ma foi_ he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about	41.83616256713867
15958/28840	Gentlemen said Albert Germain informs me that breakfast is	326.6014709472656
15959/28840	My dear count allow me to show you the	32.441810607910156
15960/28840	They passed silently into the breakfastroom and everyone took his	98.58686828613281
15961/28840	Gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may	163.97677612304688
15962/28840	I am a stranger and a stranger to such a degree that this is the first time I have ever been at	34.50226593017578
15963/28840	The French way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time I have followed the Eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the Paris	103.73350524902344
15964/28840	I beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish too Italian or too	248.70033264160156
15965/28840	With what an air he says all this muttered Beauchamp decidedly he is a great	79.87337493896484
15966/28840	A great man in his own country added Debr	61.004268646240234
15967/28840	A great man in every country	218.52615356445312
15968/28840	The count was it may be remembered a most temperate	385.9550476074219
15969/28840	Albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the Parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential	175.8871612548828
15970/28840	My dear count said he I fear one thing and that is that the fare of the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza di Sp	22.078414916992188
15971/28840	I ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared	105.27622985839844
15972/28840	I eat everywhere and of everything only I eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for I have not eaten since yesterday	143.69326782226562
15973/28840	And you ate in your carriage asked Morcer	53.49240493774414
15974/28840	No I slept as I generally do when I am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to	172.73121643066406
15975/28840	But you can sleep when you please monsieur said Mor	19.596101760864258
15976/28840	You have a recipe for it   An infallible	98.4847183227539
15977/28840	That would be invaluable to us in Africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to	142.1747589111328
15978/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was	80.00892639160156
15979/28840	May we inquire what is this recipe asked Debr	77.34154510498047
15980/28840	Oh yes returned Monte Cristo I make no secret of	46.03477096557617
15981/28840	It is a mixture of excellent opium which I fetched myself from Canton in order to have it pure and the best hashish which grows in the Eastthat is between the Tigris and the Euph	80.52436828613281
15982/28840	These two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into	558.1617431640625
15983/28840	Ten minutes after one is taken the effect is	408.0502014160156
15984/28840	Ask Baron Franz dÉpinay I think he tasted them one	44.799583435058594
15985/28840	Yes replied Morcerf he said something about it to	25.196727752685547
15986/28840	But said Beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you  	120.47542572021484
15987/28840	Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued Beauchamp hoping to take him at a	54.82990264892578
15988/28840	This ball had an acrid and penetrating	346.8897705078125
15989/28840	There were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a	83.5670394897461
15990/28840	The casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to	92.57816314697266
15991/28840	And is it your cook who prepares these pills asked Beauch	97.1061019897461
15992/28840	Oh no monsieur replied Monte Cristo I do not thus betray my enjoyments to the	38.7446403503418
15993/28840	I am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills	155.77183532714844
15994/28840	This is a magnificent emerald and the largest I have ever seen said ChâteauRenaud although my mother has some remarkable family	51.38306427001953
15995/28840	I had three similar ones returned Monte Crist	106.64393615722656
15996/28840	I gave one to the Sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy father the Pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor Pius	253.7662811279297
15997/28840	I kept the third for myself and I had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I	170.74700927734375
15998/28840	Everyone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was	30.620895385742188
15999/28840	However the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former	106.66326141357422
16000/28840	And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked Debr	110.4730453491211
16001/28840	The Sultan the liberty of a woman replied the Count the Pope the life of a man so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a	74.97615814208984
16002/28840	And it was Peppino you saved was it not cried Morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon   Perhaps returned the count	67.88709259033203
16003/28840	My dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said Morcer	44.11308670043945
16004/28840	For example here is Debray who reads and Beauchamp who prints every day A member of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the Boulevard four persons have been assassinated in the Rue	67.32879638671875
16005/28840	Tell them yourself that I was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession I should now have been sleeping in the Catacombs of	94.71788024902344
16006/28840	Sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du He	150.2450408935547
16007/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo you promised me never to mention that	51.583152770996094
16008/28840	It was not I who made that promise cried Morcerf it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have	56.883758544921875

16010/28840	It seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what	102.35845184326172
16011/28840	20249m       Well you promise me if I tell all I know to relate in your turn all that I do not know   That is but fair replied Monte Crist	28.475778579711914
16012/28840	The letter is still to be seen for it is in Franz dÉpinays possession signed by me and with a postscript of	102.10291290283203

16023/28840	How have I deviated from those principles monsieur asked Monte Cristo who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing	34.92230224609375
16024/28840	Why it seems to me replied Morrel that in delivering	60.1287727355957

16026/28840	Of which he is the brightest ornament said Beauchamp drinking off a glass of	89.13115692138672
16027/28840	My dear count cried Morcerf you are at faultyou one of the most formidable logicians I knowand you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthrop	53.81859588623047
16028/28840	My dear vicomte returned Monte Cristo I do not see in all I have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies I have	54.35051727294922
16029/28840	I will appeal to any of these gentlemen could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him Besides you know I had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came to	82.64215087890625
16030/28840	You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your	145.60630798339844
16031/28840	I will keep it returned Morcerf but I fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic hor	79.03284454345703

16034/28840	I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as I shared yours at RomeI who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist _par excellence_ for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were	219.09771728515625
16035/28840	Ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation I recollect that at Rome you said something of a projected	50.769535064697266
16036/28840	May I congratulate you   The affair is still in	67.00228118896484
16037/28840	And he who says in projection means already decided said Debr	127.136474609375
16038/28840	No replied Morcerf my father is most anxious about it and I hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothedMademoiselle Eugénie Dangl	22.707500457763672

16058/28840	You have no idea then Morrel asked ChâteauRenaud you do not propose	24.817428588867188

16063/28840	One minute cried Albert without giving Monte Cristo the time to	148.93727111816406

16067/28840	Thanks monsieur said Monte Cristo I shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already	38.05611038208008
16068/28840	What cried Morcerf you are then going to a hotelthat will be very dull for	40.76289749145508
16069/28840	Was I so badly lodged at Rome said Monte Cristo	61.37871170043945
16070/28840	_Parbleu_ at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every	85.73094177246094
16071/28840	It is not that which deterred me replied Monte Cristo but as I determined to have a house to myself I sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished	42.966278076171875
16072/28840	But you have then a valet de chambre who knows Paris said Beauch	17.96385955810547
16073/28840	It is the first time he has ever been in	23.65050506591797
16074/28840	He is black and cannot speak returned Monte Crist	74.54257202148438
16075/28840	It is Ali cried Albert in the midst of the general	66.30860900878906
16076/28840	Yes Ali himself my Nubian mute whom you saw I think at	168.21817016601562
16077/28840	Certainly said Morcerf I recollect him	25.454334259033203
16078/28840	But how could you charge a Nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish ithe will do everything	116.89012145996094
16079/28840	Undeceive yourself monsieur replied Monte Cristo I am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as I	23.313232421875
16080/28840	He knows my tastes my caprices my	315.7737121582031
16081/28840	He has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by	117.30850219726562
16082/28840	He knew that I should arrive today at ten oclock he was waiting for me at nine at the Barrière de Fontaineble	32.209877014160156
16083/28840	He gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and Monte Cristo passed a paper to	95.22953796386719
16084/28840	Ah that is really original said Beauch	37.99296188354492
16085/28840	What do you not know your house asked Debr	20.44881248474121
16086/28840	No said Monte Cristo I told you I did not wish to be behind my time I dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscounts	44.525611877441406
16087/28840	I in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to	136.75831604003906
16088/28840	Thanks monsieur returned Monte Cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each	31.365699768066406
16089/28840	Is your steward also a Nubian asked Debr	29.155607223510742
16090/28840	No he is a countryman of yours if a Corsican is a countryman of any	96.47114562988281
16091/28840	Bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well   Yes you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a smugglerin fact	75.43416595458984
16092/28840	I would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some triflea stab with a knife for	46.62244415283203
16093/28840	And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said Debr	48.68341064453125
16094/28840	Of how much does he rob you every year   On my word replied the count not more than	65.71160888671875
16095/28840	I am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so I keep	173.80760192871094
16096/28840	Then continued ChâteauRenaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the ChampsÉlysées you only want a	30.798168182373047
16097/28840	He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the counts box at the Argentina and Valle theat	54.6800651550293
16098/28840	I have something better than that said Monte Cristo I have a	19.4905948638916
16099/28840	You procure your mistresses from the opera the Vaudeville or the Variétés I purchased mine at Constantinople it cost me more but I have nothing to	143.5613555908203
16100/28840	But you forget replied Debray laughing that we are Franks by name and franks by nature as King Charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in France your slave becomes	164.0439453125
16101/28840	Who will tell her   The first person who sees	80.52544403076172
16102/28840	But at least we shall see her said Beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes   Oh no replied Monte Cristo I do not carry brutalism so	44.91857147216797
16103/28840	Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit	68.91523742675781
16104/28840	They had long since passed to dessert and	283.41009521484375
16105/28840	My dear Albert said Debray rising it is halfpast	35.248416900634766
16106/28840	Your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst	216.7517547607422
16107/28840	I will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he	38.580902099609375
16108/28840	Take care returned Albert no one has been able to accomplish	82.17719268798828
16109/28840	Oh we have three millions for our police it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this	77.41079711914062
16110/28840	And when you know will you tell me   I promise	22.9123592376709
16111/28840	As he left the room Debray called out loudly My	76.38648986816406
16112/28840	Bravo said Beauchamp to Albert I shall not go to the Chamber but I have something better to offer my readers than a speech of	70.919921875
16113/28840	For heavens sake Beauchamp returned Morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him	76.04923248291016
16114/28840	Is he not peculiar   He is more than that replied ChâteauRenaud he is one of the most extraordinary men I ever saw in my	25.59296989440918
16115/28840	Are you coming Morrel   Directly I have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at Rue Meslay	56.98880386352539
16116/28840	Be sure I shall not fail to do so returned the count b	44.92686080932617
16117/28840	And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de ChâteauRenaud leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcer	15.106589317321777
16118/28840	The Presentation   When Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo My dear count said he allow me to commence my services as _cicerone_ by showing you a specimen of a bachelors	65.87533569335938
16119/28840	You who are accustomed to the palaces of Italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can	129.6357879638672
16120/28840	As we pass from one room to another I will open the windows to let you	197.7296142578125
16121/28840	Monte Cristo had already seen the breakfastroom and the salon on the ground	75.3442611694336
16122/28840	Albert led him first to his _atelier_ which was as we have said his favorite	65.87223052978516
16123/28840	Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all that Albert had collected hereold cabinets Japanese porcelain Oriental stuffs Venetian glass arms from all parts of the worldeverything was familiar to him and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their	141.63296508789062
16124/28840	Morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the counts guidance followed a course of archæology mineralogy and natural	126.9399642944336
16125/28840	They descended to the first floor Albert led his guest into the	77.19744873046875
16126/28840	From the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple	78.3780288696289
16127/28840	A single portrait signed by Léopold Robert shone in its carved and gilded	134.9889373779297
16128/28840	This portrait attracted the Count of Monte Cristos attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before	95.78422546386719
16129/28840	It was the portrait of a young woman of five or sixandtwenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long	68.35099029541016
16130/28840	She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her	123.76264953613281
16131/28840	She was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and	97.87046813964844
16132/28840	The light was so faint in the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the counts visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and	119.62043762207031
16133/28840	Silence prevailed for an instant during which Monte Cristo gazed intently on the	68.42841339111328
16134/28840	You have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costumea ball costume doubtlessbecomes her admir	119.24957275390625
16135/28840	Ah monsieur returned Albert I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside	54.1453971862793
16136/28840	You do not know my mother she it is whom you see	58.18883514404297
16137/28840	She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years	237.24183654785156
16138/28840	This costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in	96.78408813476562
16139/28840	The countess had this portrait painted during the counts	184.80015563964844
16140/28840	She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of Léopold Robert could not overcome his dislike to	78.35979461669922
16141/28840	It is true between ourselves that	155.61843872070312
16142/28840	de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of	56.758827209472656
16143/28840	It is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease	98.18547058105469
16144/28840	de Morcerf whose portrait by Gros I will also show	111.63219451904297
16145/28840	Excuse my talking of family matters but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this	111.86943817138672
16146/28840	The picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without	249.51901245117188
16147/28840	This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their	80.648681640625
16148/28840	20261m       Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his	32.96785354614258
16149/28840	Now said Albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they	51.341575622558594
16150/28840	Consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of	84.28787231445312
16151/28840	de Morcerf he whom I wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom I announced your promised visit and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in	115.15052032470703
16152/28840	You are somewhat _blasé_ I know and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor who has seen so many	121.43809509277344

16154/28840	Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a	169.023681640625

16308/28840	I have never before been at Paris and it is the first time I have ever even set my foot in	50.720619201660156

16313/28840	What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris	92.49238586425781
16314/28840	Bertuccio   I cried the steward with a strange	43.34479904174805
16315/28840	His excellency did not charge me to purchase this	46.06490707397461
16316/28840	If his excellency will recollectif he will think   Ah true observed Monte Cristo I recollect	42.234886169433594

16318/28840	It is not yet too late cried Bertuccio eagerly and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission I will find you a better at Enghien at FontenayauxRoses or at Bellev	59.57192611694336
16319/28840	Oh no returned Monte Cristo negligently since I have this I will keep	65.4560775756836
16320/28840	And you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his	58.487937927246094
16321/28840	It is a charming place well supplied with springwater and fine trees a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought	192.08810424804688

16323/28840	_Peste_ let us not lose such an opportunity returned Monte Crist	93.24199676513672
16324/28840	And he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the propriet	77.68395233154297
16325/28840	Bertuccio said he give fiftyfive thousand francs to monsie	35.34910202026367
16326/28840	The steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of banknotes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all	62.301448822021484
16327/28840	And now demanded the count are all the forms complied with   All	136.44378662109375

16333/28840	Well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count and he made a gesture of polite	58.24441146850586
16334/28840	The notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met a similar	53.07894515991211
16335/28840	See this gentleman out said the count to Bertucc	49.56914138793945
16336/28840	And the steward followed the notary out of the	51.69292068481445

16338/28840	After having sought for a few minutes he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his _souvenirs_   Auteuil Rue de la Fontaine	51.81163024902344

16343/28840	You know the environs of Paris then   No excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which Monte Cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquiet	52.360477447509766
16344/28840	It is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for I wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful	82.84771728515625

16346/28840	Bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any	63.99679946899414
16347/28840	Why what has happened to youare you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage asked Monte Cristo in the same tone that Louis	38.62527084350586
16348/28840	pronounced the famous I have been almost obliged to	206.2417755126953
16349/28840	Bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice   His excellencys horses   Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward	34.609745025634766
16350/28840	Your excellencys carriage is at the door said	30.990493774414062

16354/28840	Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the stewards extraordinary repugnance for the counts projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little	142.59645080566406
16355/28840	In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil the stewards emotion had continued to augment as they entered the	70.68373107910156
16356/28840	Bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they	84.7981948852539

16359/28840	Bertuccios forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachmanRue de la Fontaine	75.05999755859375

16370/28840	Ah I am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for	66.17805480957031
16371/28840	The Marquis of SaintMéran returned the	20.762292861938477

16383/28840	The steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to	60.06100082397461
16384/28840	They went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the	158.310546875

16392/28840	Go on Monsieur Bertuccio said the	8.699356079101562
16393/28840	But he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recol	87.99492645263672

16400/28840	The door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant only to sink into	137.22105407714844
16401/28840	The steward wished to turn to the	76.06623840332031

16408/28840	Monsieur I implore you do not stay there   I think you are going mad Bertuccio said the count cold	20.326141357421875
16409/28840	If that is the case I warn you I shall have you put in a lunatic	24.527477264404297
16410/28840	Alas excellency returned Bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the counts laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous	71.69033813476562
16411/28840	Alas excellency the evil has arrived  	84.30957794189453
16412/28840	I knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and I overlooked that in Italy because in Italy those things are thought nothing	126.07018280029297

16419/28840	I do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus	65.36724090576172
16420/28840	It is a bad sign a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a	104.46796417236328
16421/28840	Oh your excellency returned Bertuccio in deep	16.701322555541992
16422/28840	Or as you are a Corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call	40.27857208251953
16423/28840	Yes my good master cried Bertuccio casting himself at the counts feet it was simply vengeancenothing	169.51101684570312
16424/28840	I understand that but I do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this	36.97487258911133
16425/28840	But monsieur it is very natural returned Bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was	29.913894653320312

16429/28840	This is strange returned Monte Cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much	74.69589233398438
16430/28840	Monsieur said the steward it is fatality I am	20.363346099853516

16450/28840	Bah replied Monte Cristo impossible   It is as I tell	26.198165893554688

16453/28840	Really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest	118.05618286132812

16456/28840	Where you please returned Monte Cristo since I know nothing at all of	38.68662643432617
16457/28840	I thought the Abbé Busoni had told your excell	11.582438468933105
16458/28840	Some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight years ago and I have forgotten	71.63398742675781
16459/28840	Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excell	65.02763366699219

16467/28840	But that is the history of the Hundred Days	42.26424026489258
16468/28840	Bertuccio said the count unless I am mistaken it has been already	69.21492004394531
16469/28840	Excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be	98.50393676757812
16470/28840	Go on I will keep my	90.06084442138672
16471/28840	I should tell you that we lived in the little village of Rogliano at the extremity of Cap Cor	61.774391174316406
16472/28840	In the smuggling line said Monte Crist	59.90034866333008
16473/28840	I loved my brother tenderly as I told your excellency and I resolved not to send the money but to take it to him	47.55427932739258
16474/28840	I left five hundred with Assunta my sisterinlaw and with the other five hundred I set off for Nî	83.76663208007812
16475/28840	It was easy to do so and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my	123.51763153076172
16476/28840	But after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the Rhô	53.632904052734375
16477/28840	At last however we succeeded and worked up to Ar	361.9583435058594
16478/28840	I left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire and took the road to Nî	17.958215713500977
16479/28840	We are getting to the story now   Yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see I only tell you what is absolutely	39.425533294677734
16480/28840	Just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of	39.45086669921875
16481/28840	Three brigands called Trestaillon Truphemy and Graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of Bonapart	312.1433410644531
16482/28840	You have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency   Vaguely I was far from France at that	46.12470245361328
16483/28840	As I entered Nîmes I literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and	208.09567260742188
16484/28840	My misgivings had been but too	369.1369323730469
16485/28840	My brother had arrived the previous evening at Nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been	31.8155517578125
16486/28840	I did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their names so much were they	144.82510375976562
16487/28840	I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so much and which feared nothing and I went to the kings	72.23849487304688
16488/28840	And this kings attorney was named Villefort asked Monte Cristo care	47.49409866333008
16489/28840	Yes your excellency he came from Marseilles where he had been deputy procure	24.26459312438965
16490/28840	His zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the Island of El	37.88924026489258
16491/28840	Then said Monte Cristo you went to him   Monsieur I said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of Nîmes I know not by whom but it is your duty to find	32.11866760253906
16492/28840	You are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to	80.96448516845703

16495/28840	You are mistaken monsieur I replied he has perished by the poni	29.804859161376953
16496/28840	What do you want me to do asked the	29.32853889465332
16497/28840	On whom   On his	88.43610382080078
16498/28840	How should I know who they are   Order them to be sought	113.02167510986328
16499/28840	Why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a	85.41108703613281
16500/28840	All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly	102.62250518798828
16501/28840	Pray try and obtain a small government pension for	520.5679931640625
16502/28840	Every revolution has its catastrophes returned	591.6366577148438
16503/28840	de Villefort your brother has been the victim of	41.27695083618164
16504/28840	It is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his	135.7512664794922
16505/28840	If we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to	84.5745620727539
16506/28840	What has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of repris	144.04319763183594
16507/28840	What cried I do you a magistrate speak thus to me   All these Corsicans are mad on my honor replied	69.55261993408203
16508/28840	de Villefort they fancy that their countryman is still	221.25732421875
16509/28840	You have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too late	80.30526733398438
16510/28840	Go now at once or I shall have you put	69.70318603515625
16511/28840	I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreat	67.01426696777344
16512/28840	But he was a man of	48.96891784667969
16513/28840	I approached him and said in a low voice Well since you know the Corsicans so well you know that they always keep their	63.89068603515625
16514/28840	You think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a Bonapartist because you are a royal	32.815711975097656
16515/28840	Well I who am a Bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that I will kill	53.822509765625
16516/28840	From this moment I declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has	84.59759521484375
16517/28840	And before he had recovered from his surprise I opened the door and left the	35.02222442626953
16518/28840	Well well said Monte Cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things	85.47908782958984
16519/28840	Bertuccio and to a kings attorney at that But did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta   He knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and	86.40412902832031
16520/28840	Fortunately I was so well concealed that he could not find	33.4420166015625
16521/28840	Then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at Nîmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to Versa	64.05990600585938
16522/28840	But as you know a Corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance so his carriage fast as it went was never above half a days journey before me who followed him on	174.90396118164062
16523/28840	The most important thing was not to kill him onlyfor I had an opportunity of doing so a hundred timesbut to kill him without being discoveredat least without being	83.0901870727539
16524/28840	I no longer belonged to myself for I had my sisterinlaw to protect and provide	135.09815979003906
16525/28840	de Villefort for three months he took not a step outofdoors without my following	83.9678726196289
16526/28840	At length I discovered that he went mysteriously to Auteu	47.21478271484375
16527/28840	Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio	45.2110481262207
16528/28840	As I had nothing more to do at Versailles I went to Auteuil and gained all the information I	34.584835052490234
16529/28840	If I wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for	117.09518432617188
16530/28840	The house belonged as the concierge informed your excellency to	60.54185104370117
16531/28840	de SaintMéran lived at Marseilles so that this country house was useless to him and it was reported to be let to a young widow known only by the name of the Baron	60.02109146118164
16532/28840	One evening as I was looking over the wall I saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows and I guessed that she was awaiting	68.71186065673828
16533/28840	When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very	200.96286010742188
16534/28840	As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure I saw she would ere long become a	207.18833923339844
16535/28840	A few moments after the little door was opened and a man	55.6127815246582
16536/28840	The young woman hastened to meet	46.22373580932617
16537/28840	They threw themselves into each others arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the	123.7269515991211
16538/28840	de Villefort I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden	46.02681350708008
16539/28840	20291m       And asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman   No excellency returned Bertuccio you will see that I had no time to learn	14.887219429016113
16540/28840	Three days after about seven oclock in the evening I saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to Sèv	43.10856628417969
16541/28840	I concluded that he was going to Versailles and I was not	34.0460319519043
16542/28840	Three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after	102.50420379638672
16543/28840	I descended rapidly although I had not seen Villeforts face I recognized him by the beating of my	65.95426177978516
16544/28840	I crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which I had once before looked into the	45.608272552490234
16545/28840	This time I did not content myself with looking but I took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the	113.31404876708984
16546/28840	My first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the	97.15509796142578
16547/28840	Nothing then preventing my escape by this means I examined the	255.9774169921875
16548/28840	The garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and	204.67396545410156
16549/28840	In order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door	53.44173049926758
16550/28840	de Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of	29.01413345336914
16551/28840	20293m       It was the end of September the wind blew	22.080730438232422
16552/28840	Two hours passed thus during which I imagined I heard moans	281.38616943359375
16553/28840	As the last stroke died away I saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just	73.39665985107422
16554/28840	The door opened and the man in the mantle reapp	38.99284744262695
16555/28840	The terrible moment had come but I had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the	82.24466705322266
16556/28840	I drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to	150.3265838623047
16557/28840	The man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in his	49.31816864013672
16558/28840	I was afraid not of a struggle but of a	145.7318878173828
16559/28840	When he was only a few paces from me I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a sp	54.34134292602539
16560/28840	I was still unable to divine for what reason	126.3309326171875
16561/28840	de Villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where I was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the	49.57417297363281
16562/28840	I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more	112.21311950683594
16563/28840	Then I confess curiosity mingled with hatred I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there and I remained motionless holding my	60.48777770996094
16564/28840	Then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches	143.52235412597656
16565/28840	I know not if he heard these words I think he did not for he fell without a	58.41911697387695
16566/28840	I felt his blood gush over my face but I was intoxicated I was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning	130.80276489257812
16567/28840	In a second I had disinterred the box then that it might not be known I had done so I filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which I doublelocked carrying off the	64.3857421875
16568/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and	38.83203125
16569/28840	No your excellency returned Bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by	15.93686580657959
16570/28840	And was the sum a large one   It was not	97.40967559814453
16571/28840	Ah I recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant   Yes excellency I hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the	42.704830169677734
16572/28840	In a fine linen cloth was wrapped a newborn	331.144287109375
16573/28840	Its purple visage and its violetcolored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my	120.83523559570312
16574/28840	In my turn I uttered a cry but a cry of	46.34370040893555
16575/28840	God has not cursed me then I cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life I have taken	69.4391860961914
16576/28840	20295m       And what did you do with the child asked Monte Crist	12.177815437316895
16577/28840	It was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to	154.49388122558594

16588/28840	No you were not for it was in reality a little	59.50149154663086

16591/28840	Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow I eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a	134.8791046142578

16593/28840	We profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends	76.92710876464844
16594/28840	We had thus at AiguesMortes Martigues or Bouc a dozen places where we left our goods and where in case of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and customhouse	122.19532012939453

16602/28840	One day as I was setting off on an expedition Go said she at your return I will give you a	139.63616943359375
16603/28840	I questioned her but in vain she would tell me nothing and I	133.9239501953125
16604/28840	Our expedition lasted nearly six weeks we had been to Lucca to take in oil to Leghorn for English cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of	163.4537353515625
16605/28840	When I entered the house the first thing I beheld in the middle of Assuntas chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months	103.99694061279297
16606/28840	I uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness I had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I had abandoned this	60.93451690673828
16607/28840	For the assassination itself I had never felt any	269.8852233886719
16608/28840	She had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for Paris and had reclaimed	92.20382690429688
16609/28840	No objection was raised and the infant was given up to	155.58914184570312
16610/28840	Ah I confess your excellency when I saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle I felt my eyes filled with	77.70989227294922
16611/28840	Ah Assunta cried I you are an excellent woman and Heaven will bless	158.0203857421875
16612/28840	This said Monte Cristo is less correct than your philosophyit is only	57.23670959472656
16613/28840	Alas your excellency is right replied Bertuccio and God made this infant the instrument of our	58.3043212890625
16614/28840	Never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing	205.61598205566406
16615/28840	Unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether	228.22897338867188
16616/28840	The proverb was but too correct as regarded Benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst	129.46331787109375
16617/28840	It is true that the indulgence of his fostermother encouraged	75.2492904663086
16618/28840	One day Benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a	94.4333267211914
16619/28840	For more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a	75.6927261352539
16620/28840	A boatman who had passed by Rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to	141.5220489501953
16621/28840	Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said I confess how you obtained this	321.2653503417969
16622/28840	Benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his ver	121.3663101196289
16623/28840	I became angry he began to laugh I threatened to strike him and he made two steps	169.08067321777344
16624/28840	You cannot beat me said he you have no right for you are not my	46.73411178588867
16625/28840	20299m       We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childs whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching	112.54019927978516
16626/28840	When I was at Rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became master and everything went	205.16175842285156
16627/28840	When he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in Bastia or indeed in Corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a	135.89698791503906
16628/28840	I became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious	274.3365173339844
16629/28840	I was compelled at this period to leave Corsica on an important expedition I reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune I resolved that Benedetto should accompany	93.33768463134766
16630/28840	I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now wellnigh if not quite	155.3651580810547
16631/28840	I spoke to Benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of	101.60602569580078
16632/28840	He heard me patiently and when I had finished burst out	180.74449157714844
16633/28840	The arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied	96.62693786621094
16634/28840	Benedetto rejoined his associates and I saw him from a distance point me out to them as a	96.0418472290039
16635/28840	I gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount I showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the	176.5738067626953
16636/28840	Benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a	206.48187255859375
16637/28840	My intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own	161.73751831054688
16638/28840	I set off for France after having fixed upon the	115.21297454833984
16639/28840	Our cargo was to be landed in the Gulf of Lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 18	63.13405227661133
16640/28840	The most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the customhouse officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at Beauca	47.00092315673828
16641/28840	20301m       Our expedition made a favorable	66.10820007324219
16642/28840	We anchored our vesselwhich had a double hold where our goods were concealedamidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhône from Beaucaire to Ar	146.64031982421875
16643/28840	On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were	68.69312286376953
16644/28840	Whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed I know not but one evening about five oclock our little cabinboy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of customhouse officers advancing in our	89.57794189453125
16645/28840	It was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the Rhône but the care according to the boys account that they took to avoid being	97.85651397705078
16646/28840	I was now safe for I could swim along the ditch without being seen and I reached the canal in	131.87576293945312
16647/28840	I have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from Nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from Bellegarde to Beauca	18.6610164642334
16648/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo I perfectly recollect him I think he was your	32.216796875
16649/28840	Precisely answered Bertuccio but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in	130.66363525390625
16650/28840	Of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that I intended to ask	106.11360931396484
16651/28840	What was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in Bertuccios	104.34564208984375
16652/28840	Gaspard Caderousse he had married a woman from the village of Carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her	43.87940979003906
16653/28840	She was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by	417.99462890625
16654/28840	As for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or fiveandforty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and	81.17520141601562
16655/28840	And you say interrupted Monte Cristo that this took place towards the year   1829 your excell	57.19232177734375
16656/28840	The beginning or the end   The evening of the 3	63.56641387939453
16657/28840	20303m       Ah said Monte Cristo the evening of the 3rd of June 18	16.46826934814453
16658/28840	My intention was if Caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the customhouse officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rhône and ascertain the state of our vessel and its	108.32715606689453
16659/28840	I stepped into the shed and it was fortunate I did so for at that moment Caderousse entered with a	71.68388366699219
16660/28840	I waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because I could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often	181.88739013671875
16661/28840	Then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife Hello Carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is	87.69082641601562
16662/28840	An exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble	50.97777557373047
16663/28840	What do you say asked his wife pale as	98.77494812011719
16664/28840	I say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of Paris will give us 50000 francs for	39.627079010009766
16665/28840	Only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as I have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our	77.58160400390625
16666/28840	In the meantime please to sit down monsieur and I will fetch you some refresh	38.62099075317383
16667/28840	The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a	62.88732147216797
16668/28840	Relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wifes story to see if the two recitals	76.8106918334961
16669/28840	Oh returned she it was a gift of	125.6812973022461
16670/28840	My husband was a great friend in 1814 or 1815 of a sailor named Edmond Dantè	28.257230758666992
16671/28840	This poor fellow whom Caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to	62.41262435913086
16672/28840	The same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be	114.31446838378906
16673/28840	Theres only the price we are not agreed	241.4276580810547
16674/28840	I thought we agreed for the price I	295.6736145019531
16675/28840	That is replied the jeweller I offered 40000 franc	44.85238265991211
16676/28840	Forty thousand cried La Carconte we will not part with it for that	91.44398498535156
16677/28840	The abbé told us it was worth 50000 without the	61.94863510131836
16678/28840	What was the abbés name asked the indefatigable question	69.07130432128906
16679/28840	He was a foreigner   An Italian from the neighborhood of Mantua I	89.32908630371094
16680/28840	Let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a	68.14200592041016
16681/28840	Caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jew	39.30870819091797
16682/28840	At the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazelnut La Carcontes eyes sparkled with cup	49.9454460144043
16683/28840	And what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said Monte Cristo did you credit it   Yes your excell	23.03350257873535
16684/28840	I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man and I thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a	78.48039245605469
16685/28840	That did more honor to your heart than to your experience	185.55352783203125
16686/28840	The jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it	93.78005981445312
16687/28840	I will give you 45000 said he but not a sou more besides as that is the exact value of the stone I brought just that sum with	94.02619934082031
16688/28840	Oh thats no matter replied Caderousse I will go back with you to fetch the other 5000 franc	33.233951568603516
16689/28840	No returned the jeweller giving back the diamond and the ring to Caderousse no it is worth no more and I am sorry I offered so much for the stone has a flaw in it which I had not	62.454872131347656
16690/28840	However I will not go back on my word and I will give 45	31.339149475097656
16691/28840	At least replace the diamond in the ring said La Carconte	99.67818450927734
16692/28840	Ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the	68.20916748046875
16693/28840	No matter observed Caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase	112.52603149414062
16694/28840	Yes continued the jeweller but someone else will not be so easy as I am or content himself with the same	52.14622116088867
16695/28840	It is not natural that a man like you should possess such a	52.846275329589844
16696/28840	You will have to find the Abbé Busoni and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are	53.87039566040039
16697/28840	Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each	79.06069946289062
16698/28840	No said Caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 5000 franc	18.418346405029297
16699/28840	As you please my dear sir said the jeweller I had however as you see brought you the money in bright	54.22122573852539
16700/28840	And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet of bank	37.402061462402344
16701/28840	There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his	90.00468444824219
16702/28840	What do you think of this he asked in a low	21.061906814575195
16703/28840	Let him have itlet him have it she	220.8055877685547
16704/28840	If he returns to Beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the Abbé Busoniin all probability we shall never see	55.17263412475586
16705/28840	Well then so I will said Caderousse so you may have the diamond for 45000 franc	42.2895393371582
16706/28840	But my wife wants a gold chain and I want a pair of silver buck	110.16410064697266
16707/28840	The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles	117.8396987915039
16708/28840	Here he said I am very straightforward in my dealingstake your	84.55052947998047
16709/28840	The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen franc	173.7189483642578
16710/28840	I hope you will not complain now said the jew	36.09139633178711
16711/28840	The abbé told me it was worth 50000 francs muttered Cader	18.157333374023438
16712/28840	Come comegive it to me What a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his	66.0731201171875
16713/28840	Here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table 15000 francs in gold and 30000 francs in bank	38.304344177246094
16714/28840	Wait whilst I light the lamp said La Carconte it is growing dark and there may be some	78.5293960571289
16715/28840	In fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half	139.4894256591797
16716/28840	The thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller Caderousse or La Carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of	74.13079071044922
16717/28840	I myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these banknotes it seemed to me that I was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream I felt myself riveted to the	64.44247436523438
16718/28840	Caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her	157.48480224609375
16719/28840	During this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those whichprecursors of the stormbegan to play in at the	120.00665283203125
16720/28840	Well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right   Yes said Cader	29.85821533203125
16721/28840	Give me the pocketbook La Carconte and find a bag	87.5257797241211
16722/28840	La Carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocketbook and a	70.42212677001953
16723/28840	From the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the banknotes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable	89.69847869873047
16724/28840	There said Caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10000 francs will you have your supper with us I invite you with	92.10486602783203
16725/28840	Thank you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and I must return to Beaucairemy wife will be getting	75.88621520996094
16726/28840	He drew out his watch and exclaimed _Morbleu_ nearly nine oclockwhy I shall not get back to Beaucaire before midnight Goodnight my	66.5445556640625
16727/28840	If the Abbé Busoni should by any accident return think of	35.9942512512207
16728/28840	In another week you will have left Beaucaire remarked Caderousse for the fair ends in a few	64.52244567871094
16729/28840	Write to me at Paris to	93.94498443603516
16730/28840	Joannes in the Palais Royal arcade Pierre	83.22822570800781
16731/28840	I will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth	86.4388656616211
16732/28840	At this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the	72.91707611083984
16733/28840	20307m       See here exclaimed Cader	17.893369674682617
16734/28840	You cannot think of going out in such weather as	155.83355712890625
16735/28840	Oh I am not afraid of thunder said the jew	30.770374298095703
16736/28840	And then there are robbers said La Carcon	31.59817123413086
16737/28840	The road is never very safe during fair	935.9943237304688
16738/28840	Oh as to the robbers said Joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the	53.555606842041016
16739/28840	Here said he are dogs who bark and bite at the same time they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond Friend Cader	96.92656707763672
16740/28840	Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning	137.24075317382812
16741/28840	It seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible	46.788536071777344
16742/28840	Well then a good journey to you said Cader	32.567386627197266
16743/28840	He then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went	56.4606819152832
16744/28840	At the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly	72.8536148071289
16745/28840	Oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a	67.14803314208984

16771/28840	La Carconte on the contrary rose and going with a firm step towards the door opened it saying as she did so   Come in dear	59.52845001220703
16772/28840	_Ma foi_ said the jeweller drenched with rain I am not destined to return to Beaucaire	44.088653564453125

16780/28840	Have you any other guests in your house inquired	127.76528930664062
16781/28840	Nobody but ourselves replied Caderousse the fact is we do not lodge travellersindeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping	144.3231658935547
16782/28840	Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience	49.12038040161133

16789/28840	I dont want any supper said Cader	29.558395385742188

16793/28840	From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning	130.7860565185547
16794/28840	There there said La Carconte do you hear that upon my word you did well to come	53.3565559387207
16795/28840	Nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time I have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated I shall make another	96.06493377685547
16796/28840	Its the mistral said Caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow	58.23038864135742
16797/28840	Well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all I can say is so much the worse for those who are	36.12068557739258
16798/28840	Yes chimed in La Carconte they will have a wretched night of	65.71875
16799/28840	The jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive host	151.7222900390625
16800/28840	Had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished	155.68814086914062
16801/28840	Caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened	115.88726806640625
16802/28840	I believe the storm is over said	139.90782165527344
16803/28840	But as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his	87.60064697265625
16804/28840	Trembling and awestruck Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hear	93.31649780273438
16805/28840	You must be tired said she to the jeweller I have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep	83.3981704711914
16806/28840	He passed over my head and I heard the flooring creak beneath his	95.22249603271484
16807/28840	The quick eager glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended while Caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at	71.50935363769531
16808/28840	Overhead I could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his	120.21735382080078
16809/28840	Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong I sought not to shake it	372.94219970703125
16810/28840	La Carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to	41.291351318359375

16815/28840	Confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually I fell into a deep heavy sl	123.6252212524414
16816/28840	How long I had been in this unconscious state I know not when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful	72.73902893066406
16817/28840	Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the	125.55580139160156
16818/28840	I had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again I heard groans mingled with halfstifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly	209.0733642578125
16819/28840	A cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy letharg	135.66268920898438
16820/28840	To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silenceunbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber	108.20304870605469
16821/28840	The staircase creaked he descended into the room below approached the fire and lit a	108.89061737060547

16823/28840	Having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more I heard his rapid and uneasy	295.262939453125
16824/28840	Then all became clear and manifest to me and I reproached myself with what had happened as though I myself had done the guilty	121.5443344116211
16825/28840	For this purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining	134.45458984375
16826/28840	The poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and I found myself in the	161.19247436523438
16827/28840	Hastily snatching up the lighted candle I hurried to the staircase about midway a body was lying quite across the	258.0240783691406
16828/28840	The pistol I had heard had doubtless been fired at	227.77420043945312
16829/28840	The shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in	242.82789611816406
16830/28840	I strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest	252.9980926513672
16831/28840	The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the	131.60218811035156
16832/28840	The murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the	106.05887603759766
16833/28840	I stumbled over some object I stooped to examineit was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being	181.53309631347656
16834/28840	This appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses and finding that I could no longer be of service to anyone in the house my only desire was to	141.04566955566406
16835/28840	I rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of	92.49846649169922
16836/28840	Upon reaching the room below I found five or six customhouse officers and two or three gendarmesall heavily	58.84611892700195

16843/28840	Then I saw that they took me for the	54.61101150512695

16847/28840	Alas resistance was far from my	452.3124694824219
16848/28840	I was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word I suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horses tail and thus they took me to Nî	87.2094955444336
16849/28840	One only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the Abbé Busoni who had stopped at the inn of the Pont du Gard on that	53.808319091796875

16851/28840	Caderousse still evaded all pursuit and I had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable	250.6221160888672
16852/28840	You may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him and how minutely I related the whole of what I had seen and	93.2265625
16853/28840	I felt some degree of nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all I	122.31027221679688
16854/28840	That which I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of	66.70206451416016
16855/28840	My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil proved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood	98.29644775390625

16878/28840	And in what light did you view the occurrence inquired Monte Crist	89.80842590332031
16879/28840	As a punishment for the crime I had committed answered Bertucc	70.10637664794922

16929/28840	His excellency does not receive visitors	116.89563751220703

16955/28840	I am perfectly aware of that fact answered Monte Cristo	73.36807250976562

16991/28840	As he passed them he said   They are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them	106.14422607421875

17009/28840	The Count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the bankers	91.05638122558594
17010/28840	Danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad	44.04490280151367

17016/28840	I made inquiries and found that the house in the ChampsÉlysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept	38.96226119995117

17021/28840	The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the	33.9711799621582
17022/28840	With a slight inclination of the head Danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with	76.12277221679688

17040/28840	Why said Danglars in the letterI believe I have it about mehere he felt in his breastpocketyes here it	88.74675750732422
17041/28840	Well this letter gives the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited credit on our	34.55619430541992
17042/28840	Well baron what is there difficult to understand about that   Merely the term _unlimited_nothing else	89.47706604003906
17043/28840	Is not that word known in France The people who wrote are AngloGermans you	225.7637176513672
17044/28840	Oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document I certainly have	80.27877807617188
17045/28840	Is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and cand	131.37396240234375
17046/28840	Is it possible that Thomson  French are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers Pray tell me what you think baron for I feel uneasy I can assure you having some considerable property in their	104.6068344116211
17047/28840	Thomson  French are perfectly solvent replied Danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word _unlimited_ in financial affairs is so extremely	70.2597885131836
17048/28840	Is in fact unlimited said Monte Crist	37.603248596191406
17049/28840	Precisely what I was about to say cried Dangl	59.707149505615234
17050/28840	Now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep	224.04173278808594
17051/28840	Meaning to say rejoined Monte Cristo that however Thomson  French may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the Baron Danglars is not disposed to follow their	46.68801498413086
17052/28840	Thomson  French set no bounds to their engagements while those of	303.7973937988281
17053/28840	Danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own	69.00990295410156
17054/28840	Monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been	55.91191482543945
17055/28840	It seems then reserved for me said Monte Cristo coldly to be the first to do	26.716474533081055
17056/28840	By what right sir   By right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some	155.28021240234375
17057/28840	It was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own	45.55841064453125
17058/28840	His forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impert	158.43968200683594
17059/28840	Monte Cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the	197.9125213623047
17060/28840	The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper	107.1424789428711
17061/28840	I said a million replied Danglars with the confidence of	53.87846374511719
17062/28840	But could I do with a million retorted the	84.2613525390625
17063/28840	My dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me I should never have given myself the trouble of opening an	89.51244354248047
17064/28840	A million Excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocketbook or dressing	89.12494659423828
17065/28840	And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visitingcards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500000 francs each payable at sight to the	69.20977783203125
17066/28840	A man like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of	93.12194061279297
17067/28840	The effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apople	60.19168472290039
17068/28840	The pupils of his eyes as he gazed at Monte Cristo dilated	79.55834197998047
17069/28840	Come come said Monte Cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in Thomson 	70.15005493164062
17070/28840	I understand and foreseeing that such might be the case I took in spite of my ignorance of affairs certain	113.7635726928711
17071/28840	See here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the house of Arstein  Eskeles of Vienna to Baron Rothschild the other drawn by Baring of London upon	144.82992553710938
17072/28840	Now sir you have but to say the word and I will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two	66.94911193847656
17073/28840	Nay answered Monte Cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommod	88.31815338134766
17074/28840	Then you can let me have some money can you not   Whatever you say my dear count I am at your	38.24457550048828
17075/28840	Why replied Monte Cristo since we mutually understand each otherfor such I presume is the case Danglars bowed assent	69.00601959228516
17076/28840	You are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind   Oh my dear count exclaimed Danglars I never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards	53.99445343017578
17077/28840	Then if I should require more continued Monte Cristo in a careless manner why of course I should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in France more than a year and during that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I	90.51033782958984
17078/28840	Be kind enough then to send me 500000 francs	95.47077941894531
17079/28840	I shall be at home till midday or if not I will leave a receipt with my stew	58.04727554321289
17080/28840	The money you desire shall be at your house by ten oclock tomorrow morning my dear count replied Dangl	24.542606353759766
17081/28840	How would you like to have it in gold silver or notes   Half in gold and the other half in banknotes if you please said the count rising from his	64.74765014648438
17082/28840	I must confess to you count said Danglars that I have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of Europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to	42.10268783569336
17083/28840	May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it   It has been in the family a very long while returned Monte Cristo a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years during which the accumulated interest has doubled the	105.94843292236328
17084/28840	The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few	96.43696594238281
17085/28840	Your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted	148.97421264648438
17086/28840	However you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere	67.80689239501953
17087/28840	And the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor Franz dÉpin	105.3770751953125
17088/28840	With your tastes and means of gratifying them continued Danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the	138.13478088378906
17089/28840	If I mistake not you are an admirer of paintings at least I judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when I entered the	148.05438232421875
17090/28840	If you will permit me I shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of works by the ancient masterswarranted as	157.03317260742188
17091/28840	I cannot endure the modern school of	232.7666778564453
17092/28840	You are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great faultthat they have not yet had time to become	141.8890838623047
17093/28840	Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen Bartoloni and Canovaall foreign artists for as you may perceive I think but very indifferently of our French sculpt	153.61326599121094
17094/28840	You have a right to be unjust to them monsieur they are your compat	33.777381896972656
17095/28840	But all this may come later when we shall be better known to each	76.37691497802734
17096/28840	For the present I will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the Baroness Danglarsexcuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the	114.40989685058594
17097/28840	Monte Cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy l	131.4228973388672
17098/28840	Is the baroness at home inquired Dangl	17.037240982055664
17099/28840	And alone   No my lord madame has	51.40080642700195
17100/28840	Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict _incognito_   No indeed replied Monte Cristo with a smile I do not arrogate to myself the right of so	45.30297088623047
17101/28840	Debray inquired Danglars with an air of indulgence and goodnature that made Monte Cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the bankers domestic	45.5555534362793
17102/28840	Yes my lord replied the servant	61.48610305786133
17103/28840	Danglars nodded his head then turning to Monte Cristo said	17.28862190246582
17104/28840	Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the Minister of the	33.3673095703125
17105/28840	As for my wife I must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in	68.28997802734375
17106/28840	Her maiden name was De Servières and her first husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargon	176.3245086669922
17107/28840	I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars but I have already met	23.771724700927734
17108/28840	Ah indeed said Danglars and where was that   At the house of	28.531850814819336
17109/28840	Ah you are acquainted with the young viscount are you   We were together a good deal during the Carnival at	54.42372131347656
17110/28840	Let me see have I not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape I forget how but I know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from	158.26675415039062
17111/28840	Her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his	70.32106018066406
17112/28840	With your permission said Danglars bowing I will precede you to show you the	36.1694221496582
17113/28840	By all means replied Monte Cristo I follow	39.98042678833008
17114/28840	The truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by	169.1348419189453
17115/28840	Danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the	57.68768310546875
17116/28840	The decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien Debr	26.437334060668945
17117/28840	Lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to Madame Dangl	61.60057830810547
17118/28840	Already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de Morcerf it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by Debr	84.80805969238281
17119/28840	This posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of	284.5635681152344
17120/28840	A most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on	409.6478576660156
17121/28840	Danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with Danglars a free and easy	112.74140167236328
17122/28840	Baroness said Danglars give me leave to present to you the Count of Monte Cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at	43.33717346191406
17123/28840	I need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in Paris court his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in Paris for a year during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of	94.09180450439453
17124/28840	That means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which I trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertain	186.2655487060547
17125/28840	And when did you arrive here inquired	250.1945343017578
17126/28840	Coming as usual I presume from the extreme end of the globe Pardon meat least such I have heard is your	131.8770294189453
17127/28840	This time I have merely come from Cad	80.35149383544922
17128/28840	You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first	111.2654037475586
17129/28840	Paris is a horrible place in	174.19200134277344
17130/28840	Balls parties and _fêtes_ are over the Italian opera is in London the French opera everywhere except in	151.89950561523438
17131/28840	As for the Théatre Français you know of course that it is	83.83808135986328
17132/28840	The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the ChampdeMars and S	264.9685974121094
17133/28840	Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count   I shall do whatever they do at Paris madame if I have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of	91.73528289794922
17134/28840	Are you fond of horses count   I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East madame and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two thingsthe fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their	68.64917755126953
17135/28840	Nay count said the baroness it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies	76.47191619873047
17136/28840	You see madame how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings	223.01861572265625
17137/28840	At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undert	41.83186340332031
17138/28840	Madame Danglars turned very pale then exclaimed   I cannot believe it the thing is	41.82086181640625
17139/28840	I assure you madame replied the woman it is as I have	28.274932861328125
17140/28840	Turning impatiently towards her husband Madame Danglars demanded Is this true   Is what true madame inquired Danglars visibly	64.16974639892578
17141/28840	But what does she tell you   That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his	46.366851806640625
17142/28840	I desire to know what is the meaning of this   Be kind enough madame to listen to me said Dangl	22.491897583007812
17143/28840	Oh yes I will listen monsieur for I am most curious to hear what explanation you will	43.07050323486328
17144/28840	These two gentlemen shall decide between us but first I will state the case to	240.29913330078125
17145/28840	Gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars are two that belong exclusively to mea pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in	76.50069427490234
17146/28840	Debray I need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well	83.585693359375
17147/28840	Well I had promised Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the Bois but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gonepositively	60.01118850708008
17148/28840	Danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry franc	67.53706359863281
17149/28840	Oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators   Madame replied Danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your	50.942386627197266
17150/28840	Nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that I have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in	67.1129150390625
17151/28840	But perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses   My dear love pray do not say any more about them and I promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and	82.74913024902344
17152/28840	The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards Monte Cristo and saidUpon my word count I am quite sorry not to have met you	76.64305877685547
17153/28840	You are setting up an establishment of course   Why yes replied the	53.56922149658203
17154/28840	I should have liked to have made you the offer of these	79.48307037353516
17155/28840	I have almost given them away as it is but as I before said I was anxious to get rid of them upon any	75.86176300048828
17156/28840	They were only fit for a young	46.5804443359375
17157/28840	I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said Monte Cristo but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of carriagehorses and I do not think they were	63.63665771484375
17158/28840	Debray you are a connoisseur I believe let me have your opinion upon	52.53947448730469
17159/28840	As Debray walked towards the window Danglars approached his	34.26642990112305
17160/28840	I could not tell you before others said he in a low tone the reason of my parting with the horses but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for	81.36978149414062
17161/28840	Some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the fact is I have gained 16000 francs by the sale of	105.94216918945312
17162/28840	Come dont look so angry and you shall have 4000 francs of the money to do what you like with and Eugénie shall have	109.70264434814453
17163/28840	There what do you think now of the affair Wasnt I right to part with the horses   Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering	48.551490783691406
17164/28840	I cannot be mistaken there are your horses The very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the counts carriage   My dappled grays demanded the baroness springing to the	48.658531188964844
17165/28840	How very singular cried Monte Cristo with wellfeigned aston	50.65192794799805
17166/28840	I cannot believe it murmured the	56.01673889160156
17167/28840	Madame Danglars whispered a few words in the ear of Debray who approached Monte Cristo saying The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the	30.77475929260254
17168/28840	I scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost mewell somewhere about 30000 franc	78.92156219482422
17169/28840	Debray conveyed the counts reply to the baron	41.95453643798828
17170/28840	Poor Danglars looked so crestfallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air towards	66.84696960449219
17171/28840	See said the count how very ungrateful women	48.66426086425781
17172/28840	Your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on	56.64491653442383
17173/28840	But so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is	209.48410034179688
17174/28840	Therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but	84.89820861816406
17175/28840	Danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of Olympic Jove predicted a	62.385040283203125
17176/28840	20347m       Excellent murmured Monte Cristo to himself as he came	24.462636947631836
17177/28840	All has gone according to my	113.86113739013672
17178/28840	The domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my	151.044677734375
17179/28840	But he went on with his peculiar smile I am here in Paris and have plenty of time before meby and by will do for	97.5872802734375
17180/28840	With these reflections he entered his carriage and returned	107.80701446533203
17181/28840	The horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning only by the counts orders in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads had been fastened a large	85.47541809082031

17183/28840	During the evening Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil accompanied by	34.916221618652344
17184/28840	The following day about three oclock a single blow struck on the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the	69.85887145996094
17185/28840	Ali observed his master as the Nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not   Ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the	59.433834075927734
17186/28840	With your lasso you could stop an ox   Again Ali repeated his affirmative	280.6255187988281
17187/28840	Or a tiger   Ali bowed his head in token of ass	57.75302505493164

17189/28840	I understand said Monte Cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion   Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many	87.14277648925781

17191/28840	Ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my	137.8192901611328
17192/28840	Ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching	68.45308685302734
17193/28840	Still as five oclock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his	81.41996765136719
17194/28840	Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious	176.9261016845703
17195/28840	In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each others	54.699623107910156
17196/28840	Terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a	51.95624923706055
17197/28840	The carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of	131.4962921142578
17198/28840	Gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his	116.7007064819336

17207/28840	Is it possible exclaimed the count with wellfeigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness   They do	37.80238342285156
17208/28840	I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them I ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my	81.55491638183594
17209/28840	You are then doubtless the Count of Monte Cristo of whom Hermine has talked to me so much   You have rightly guessed madame replied the	44.454811096191406

17213/28840	Indeed I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed	158.59530639648438

17229/28840	This lady said the Count speaking to Ali in the Arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives but the boy refuses saying you are too	116.70849609375
17230/28840	Ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been wounded to the	100.89726257324219
17231/28840	Will you permit me to inquire said Madame de Villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here   No I do not replied Monte Cristo it is a small place I have purchased quite	46.104209899902344

17238/28840	I remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but I have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his	154.26869201660156
17239/28840	The count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to	156.54669189453125

17242/28840	You will find your horses in bad condition from the results of this accident they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by	94.60066223144531
17243/28840	The count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in	131.7740478515625

17251/28840	That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of	84.56198120117188
17252/28840	Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of Madame de Villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic	88.5628662109375

17322/28840	I know it sir replied Monte Cristo but when I visit a country I begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom I may have anything to hope or to fear till I know them as well as perhaps better than they know	84.8814926147461
17323/28840	It follows from this that the kings attorney be he who he may with whom I should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than I	111.41751098632812
17324/28840	That is to say replied Villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed	88.02379608154297
17325/28840	Faults or crimes responded Monte Cristo with a negligent	190.94676208496094
17326/28840	And that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothersfor you have said so observed Villefort in a tone that faltered somewhatyou alone are	118.21187591552734
17327/28840	No not perfect was the counts reply only impenetrable thats	235.06593322753906
17328/28840	But let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my seconds	97.01460266113281
17329/28840	No noby no means said Villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his	88.57760620117188
17330/28840	No by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to	261.3554382324219

17332/28840	I have my pride for menserpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under	165.86727905273438
17333/28840	But I lay aside that pride before God who has taken me from nothing to make me what I	59.715721130371094
17334/28840	Then count I admire you said Villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsie	67.98116302490234
17335/28840	Yes and I say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thingthen be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predomin	92.63909912109375
17336/28840	I wish to be Providence myself for I feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and	76.7239761352539

17339/28840	All I can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that	52.16034698486328
17340/28840	I may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added Monte Crist	64.9036865234375
17341/28840	If the thing were to do again I would again do	127.41036987304688

17343/28840	Count he inquired have you any relations   No sir I am alone in the	28.235746383666992
17344/28840	Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your	375.00360107421875
17345/28840	You say you fear nothing but death   I did not say that I feared it I only said that death alone could check the execution of my	90.97179412841797
17346/28840	And old age   My end will be achieved before I grow	293.111328125

17348/28840	It is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full	163.74510192871094
17349/28840	30031m       Sir continued Villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and	73.03019714355469
17350/28840	For instance there is apoplexythat lightningstroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an	178.82215881347656
17351/28840	Come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and I will show you my father	97.07794952392578
17352/28840	Well sir the rupture of a bloodvessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a	95.93538665771484

17357/28840	I am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter yet like Providence it has remained invisible to my eyes although present to my	211.59405517578125

17359/28840	Augustine and Gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet I can well understand that a fathers sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a	129.9126434326172
17360/28840	I will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your	77.54121398925781
17361/28840	It would have been so unquestionably had not God given me so large a	96.54325103759766
17362/28840	And what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired Monte Crist	51.90984344482422
17363/28840	My deduction is replied Villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of	162.25537109375
17364/28840	That God desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him	157.6552276611328
17365/28840	Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard	61.412113189697266
17366/28840	Besides you have made an eternal friend of Madame de Ville	17.138124465942383
17367/28840	The count bowed and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of	75.03048706054688
17368/28840	When he had gone Monte Cristo breathed a profound sigh and said   Enough of this poison let me now seek the	91.11758422851562

17370/28840	Haydée   It will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the Count of Monte Cristo residing in the Rue Meslay were no other than Maximilian Julie and	37.87303924560547
17371/28840	The young Greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the	169.0264129638672
17372/28840	Haydée had three French maids and one who was a	146.78758239746094
17373/28840	The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her	114.84405517578125
17374/28840	This was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rosecolored	46.51699447631836
17375/28840	Her attitude though perfectly natural for an Eastern woman would in a European have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after	313.3528137207031
17376/28840	The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the manycolored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian bell	134.8968048095703

17386/28840	My poor child replied Monte Cristo that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to	53.52211380004883
17387/28840	I dont want anybody else to talk to	85.93447875976562

17389/28840	Do you remember your father Haydée   The young Greek	40.195281982421875
17390/28840	He is here and here said she touching her eyes and her	52.947837829589844
17391/28840	And where am I inquired Monte Cristo laugh	145.31956481933594
17392/28840	You cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lips when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her	84.63523864746094
17393/28840	You now understand Haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your	109.29371643066406

17399/28840	I have already told you my lord that I shall see no	17.491199493408203
17400/28840	It is possible Haydée that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the East may not be practicable in	89.57960510253906
17401/28840	Endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of Rome Florence Milan and Madrid it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the	106.74075317382812

17428/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo cried Morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage I should think we would see	33.285186767578125
17429/28840	Ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your	212.3676300048828
17430/28840	And the young officer shook the counts hand so warmly that Monte Cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with	43.654117584228516

17465/28840	It was three oclock at a quarter past a merchant presented himself to insure two ships it was a clear profit of 15000 franc	71.2833023071289

17469/28840	Maximilian had scarcely finished his story during which the counts heart had swelled within him when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and	154.15536499023438
17470/28840	He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led Monte Cristo around the little garden he returned to the	35.658668518066406
17471/28840	A large vase of Japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the	138.05055236816406

17474/28840	Everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and rep	91.48419952392578
17475/28840	The count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been	55.62275695800781
17476/28840	We are very happy monsieur replied Julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than	114.3967056274414
17477/28840	The counts features displayed an expression of the most intense	179.2625274658203
17478/28840	Oh all this is a family history as ChâteauRenaud told you the other day observed Maximil	30.152883529663086
17479/28840	This humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrow	92.33304595947266
17480/28840	And God has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said Monte Cristo inquiring	76.8111343383789
17481/28840	Yes count returned Julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us one of his	112.36383819580078
17482/28840	The counts cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his	77.48396301269531
17483/28840	Monte Cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow	81.61458587646484
17484/28840	Our magnificence makes you smile count said Maximilian who had followed him with his	33.1514892578125
17485/28840	No no returned Monte Cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet	99.19871520996094
17486/28840	I was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the	79.66759490966797
17487/28840	Count replied Maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family	101.80815887451172
17488/28840	The stone seems very brilliant answered the	455.3297119140625
17489/28840	Oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at 100000 francs he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just	95.59814453125
17490/28840	This I do not comprehend and yet I may not ask for an explanation madame replied Monte Cristo b	24.9931640625

17493/28840	If we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to	186.28384399414062
17494/28840	Oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his	162.32354736328125
17495/28840	Ah really said Monte Cristo in a halfstifled	64.80982971191406
17496/28840	Monte Cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of	51.10247039794922
17497/28840	It was the letter written as our readers know to Julie and signed Sinbad the	58.60859680175781
17498/28840	Unknown you say is the man who rendered you this serviceunknown to you   Yes we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued Maximil	41.012386322021484
17499/28840	We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot comprehendwe have been guided by an invisible handa hand as powerful as that of an enchan	105.70913696289062
17500/28840	Oh cried Julie I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as I now kiss the purse which he has	113.94734191894531
17501/28840	He felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address	66.3929214477539
17502/28840	An Englishman said Monte Cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which Julie looked at	70.57017517089844
17503/28840	An Englishman you say   Yes replied Maximilian an Englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson  French at	23.20037841796875
17504/28840	It was this that made me start when you said the other day at	115.80148315429688
17505/28840	That happened as I told you in 18	65.1836929321289
17506/28840	For Gods sake tell me did you know this Englishman   But you tell me also that the house of Thomson  French have constantly denied having rendered you this service  	46.143863677978516
17507/28840	Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation   Everything is possible in this affair even a	112.87043762207031
17508/28840	What was his name asked Monte Crist	26.328903198242188
17509/28840	He gave no other name answered Julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letterSinbad the	60.5311164855957
17510/28840	Which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious	193.6268768310547
17511/28840	No returned Monte Cristo I only	60.12931823730469
17512/28840	I knew a Lord Wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this	129.85894775390625
17513/28840	Without revealing himself   He was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of	72.89545440673828
17514/28840	And do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired	37.9948616027832
17515/28840	In the name of Heaven said Maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it	24.550601959228516
17516/28840	Alas cried Monte Cristo striving to repress his emotion if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor I fear you will never see him	66.19270324707031
17517/28840	I parted from him two years ago at Palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that I fear he will never	70.88806915283203
17518/28840	Oh monsieur this is cruel of you said Julie much affected and the young ladys eyes swam with	56.11579132080078
17519/28840	But continued she Lord Wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not   Oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek	81.6629867553711
17520/28840	He was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in	41.29443359375
17521/28840	And he told you nothing   Not a	56.53738021850586
17522/28840	Nothing that would lead you to suppose  	56.84254837036133
17523/28840	And yet you spoke of him at	131.60218811035156

17526/28840	What did your father tell you	140.7633514404297
17527/28840	My father thought that this action had been miraculously performedhe believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save	138.66021728515625
17528/28840	Oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although I did not myself believe it I would not for the world have destroyed my fathers	72.9194107055664
17529/28840	This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man said	19.670146942138672
17530/28840	Yes answered Maximilian but I feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes	47.38818359375
17531/28840	His voice went to my heart observed Julie and two or three times I fancied that I had heard it	50.19813537597656
17532/28840	For the demon of speculation drew a line or in other words projected a street at the farther side of the kitcheng	75.36965942382812

17535/28840	At that instant the little sidegate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man	77.06640625
17536/28840	He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian	156.97918701171875
17537/28840	After casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the	96.02143096923828
17538/28840	At the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty	85.25162506103516

17541/28840	Dearest Valentine said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly I adore	98.89564514160156
17542/28840	You asked me the cause of my being late and why I come	164.8138885498047
17543/28840	I will candidly explain the reason of both and I trust to your goodness to pardon	88.73685455322266

17549/28840	Think of that Valentine There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from	126.52643585205078
17550/28840	Only imagine what happiness that would afford	429.1314697265625

17555/28840	A faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of Valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart   Alas no Maximilian this must not be for many	99.90939331054688
17556/28840	We should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each others prud	268.4768981933594

17561/28840	But what cared I for delays or difficulties Valentine as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me If you will only repeat that avowal now and then I can endure	110.55066680908203
17562/28840	I will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and	79.8398666381836

17581/28840	God knows I would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate	111.87796783447266
17582/28840	Poor Valentine   I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the restraint in which I am held lest I fall utterly	113.86754608154297
17583/28840	Dear Maximilian believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt to resist my fathers commands it is more on your account than my	38.06593704223633
17584/28840	But why Valentine do you persist in anticipating the worstwhy picture so gloomy a future   Because I judge it from the	152.42030334472656
17585/28840	Still consider that although I may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you I am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your	134.91127014160156
17586/28840	The days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in France and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the	124.99517822265625

17608/28840	Hush cried Valentine suddenly someone is coming Maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding	75.76606750488281
17609/28840	Mademoiselle mademoiselle exclaimed a voice from behind the	18.388010025024414
17610/28840	Madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawing	126.8089828491211
17611/28840	A visitor inquired Valentine much agitated who is it   Some grand personagea prince I believe they saidthe Count of Monte Crist	99.43048095703125
17612/28840	I will come directly cried Valentine	224.91131591796875
17613/28840	The name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom Valentines _I am coming_ was the customary signal of	54.52867889404297
17614/28840	Now then said Maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade I would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the Count of Monte Cristo is acquainted with	27.15394401550293
17615/28840	Toxicology   It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villeforts for the purpose of returning the procureurs visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in	41.86458969116211
17616/28840	After the usual civilities the count inquired after	155.6062774658203

17618/28840	Two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity	214.30528259277344
17619/28840	What is your sister Valentine doing inquired Madame de Villefort of Edward tell someone to bid her come here that I may have the honor of introducing her to the	74.47371673583984

17622/28840	But melancholy interrupted Master Edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his	147.35569763183594
17623/28840	But what detains her Go Edward and	1304.8326416015625
17624/28840	Because they are looking for her where she is not to be	42.31730651855469
17625/28840	And where are they looking for her   With grandpapa Noirt	29.425880432128906
17626/28840	And do you think she is not there   No no no no no she is not there replied Edward singing his	78.2074203491211

17628/28840	Madame de Villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waitingmaid to the spot where she would find Valentine when the young lady herself entered the	55.090084075927734
17629/28840	She appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her	178.74960327148438
17630/28840	Valentine whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen with bright chestnut hair deep blue eyes and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her	156.42788696289062
17631/28840	Her white and slender fingers her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a sw	225.0581817626953
17632/28840	She entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the counts	70.32813262939453
17633/28840	Mademoiselle de Villefort my stepdaughter said Madame de Villefort to Monte Cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards Valentine with her	18.160694122314453

17635/28840	I do not think it likely sir Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very fond of society and we very seldom go out said the young	30.031015396118164
17636/28840	Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry	101.88105010986328

17639/28840	Perhaps the count saw us in Italy said Valentine timid	79.82830047607422
17640/28840	Yes in Italy it was in Italy most probably replied Monte Cristo you have travelled then in Italy mademoiselle   Yes madame and I were there two years	45.62644958496094

17644/28840	It was at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day in the garden of the Hôtel des Postes when chance brought us together you Madame de Villefort and her son I now remember having had the honor of meeting	35.5620002746582
17645/28840	It is strange but neither do I recollect meeting with you observed Valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the	118.0366439819336

17672/28840	Allow me to observe madame said the count with that kind tone he could assume so well you are really very severe with that dear clever	91.83695220947266
17673/28840	Oh sometimes severity is quite necessary replied Madame de Villefort with all a mothers real firm	88.72120666503906

17675/28840	The fact is count answered the mother agreeably flattered he has great aptitude and learns all that is set before	269.4236145019531
17676/28840	And your precautions were successful   Completely	298.6854248046875
17677/28840	Yes I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this	95.17596435546875

17683/28840	Precisely madame replied Monte Cristo but I perceive I have not much to teach	59.012359619140625
17684/28840	Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among	235.04978942871094
17685/28840	30069m       Well replied Monte Cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so	48.756446838378906
17686/28840	Well then at the end of a month when drinking water from the same carafe you would kill the person who drank with you without your perceiving otherwise than from slight inconvenience that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this	95.5042495727539
17687/28840	Do you know any other counterpoisons   I do	41.350521087646484

17721/28840	Really   Yes I will mention one to	24.122013092041016
17722/28840	He had a remarkably fine garden full of vegetables flowers and	241.2596435546875
17723/28840	From amongst these vegetables he selected the most simplea cabbage for	234.9036865234375
17724/28840	For three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic on the third the cabbage began to droop and turn	166.47222900390625
17725/28840	In the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome	290.6581115722656
17726/28840	It was only poisoned to the Abbé Adelmon	12.02711009979248

17740/28840	Precisely so cried Monte Cristoprecisely so and this is what I said to my worthy Adelmon	195.9833984375

17764/28840	Madame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to	78.77439880371094

17766/28840	Oh observed Madame de Villefort it must be an admirable antispasmod	27.278417587280273

17773/28840	Undoubtedly and so should I prefer it after the effects I have seen produced but of course it is a secret and I am not so indiscreet as to ask it of	89.0473403930664
17774/28840	But I said Monte Cristo rising as he spokeI am gallant enough to offer it	58.24824523925781

17796/28840	One must take the world as one finds	154.81259155273438
17797/28840	Surely said Albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the Countess	55.23109817504883
17798/28840	And who is the Countess G inquired ChâteauRen	13.0404691696167
17799/28840	What a question Now do you know baron I have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the Countess G	55.29842758178711
17800/28840	Ah to be sure replied ChâteauRenaud the lovely Venetian is it not   Her	19.892032623291016
17801/28840	At this moment the countess perceived Albert and returned his salutation with a	49.92650604248047
17802/28840	You know her it seems said ChâteauRen	20.487985610961914
17803/28840	Franz introduced me to her at Rome replied	175.9088897705078

17805/28840	There was a cry of Shut up from the	107.5269546508789
17806/28840	This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their	62.653587341308594
17807/28840	The countess was present at the races in the ChampdeMars said ChâteauRen	20.838764190673828

17809/28840	Did you bet   Oh merely a paltry fifty lou	61.3985595703125
17810/28840	And who was the winner   Naut	114.21459197998047
17811/28840	But there were three races were there not   Yes there was the prize given by the Jockey Cluba gold cup you knowand a very singular circumstance occurred about that	92.11914825439453
17812/28840	What was it   Oh shut up again interposed some of the	88.07464599609375
17813/28840	Why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the	124.8775863647461
17814/28840	Is that possible   True as	241.67208862304688
17815/28840	The fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of Vampa or that of a jockey styled Job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the starting	102.1355972290039
17816/28840	They were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small riders pockets to make him weight but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole	194.68777465820312
17817/28840	And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged  	91.80171203613281
17818/28840	You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa   Exactly that was the	54.278564453125
17819/28840	Then answered Albert I am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse	79.81573486328125
17820/28840	Shut up there cried the pit in	254.2916259765625
17821/28840	And this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to	67.1842269897461
17822/28840	At this moment the door of the ministers box opened and Madame Danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by Lucien Debray who assiduously conducted them to their	33.18718719482422
17823/28840	Now barring all that I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl   Handsome certainly replied Albert but not to my taste which I confess inclines to something softer gentler and more	155.1224365234375
17824/28840	And indeed it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to comprehend the justness of Morcerfs	58.565711975097656
17825/28840	Her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale	248.8037567138672
17826/28840	The rest of Mademoiselle Eugénies person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of Diana as ChâteauRenaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and res	65.03610229492188
17827/28840	As regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a	164.33840942382812
17828/28840	It was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and	98.77104187011719
17829/28840	Still though not actually received at the Hôtel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a govern	114.91159057617188
17830/28840	Morcerf and ChâteauRenaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this	39.33484649658203
17831/28840	For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to	48.79796600341797
17832/28840	Be assured replied Albert that if I had been aware of your arrival in Paris and had known your address I should have paid my respects to you before	65.91820526123047
17833/28840	Allow me to introduce my friend Baron de ChâteauRenaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the ChampdeMars	42.20646667480469
17834/28840	So you were at the races baron inquired the countess	67.00448608398438
17835/28840	Well then pursued Madame G with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes   I am sorry to say I cannot replied the baron and I was just asking the same question of	64.15160369873047
17836/28840	Are you very anxious to know countess asked	84.9745101928711
17837/28840	Inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these wordsFrom Lord Ruthven to Countess	44.249794006347656
17838/28840	Precisely I was sure of it said Morcer	96.45421600341797
17839/28840	Sure of what   That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven	59.39915466308594
17840/28840	de ChâteauRenaud has also the honor of his	19.05237579345703
17841/28840	And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner   To be sure I remember it all	70.63114166259766
17842/28840	You see its evident where the count got the	359.2586975097656
17843/28840	I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him   I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have	93.88009643554688

17845/28840	Does his action appear like that of an enemy   No certainly	74.68199920654297
17846/28840	Well then   And so he is in Paris  	22.407960891723633
17847/28840	And what effect does he produce   Why said Albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of England took place followed by the theft of Mademoiselle Marss diamonds and so people talked of something	76.75270080566406
17848/28840	My good fellow said ChâteauRenaud the count is your friend and you treat him	30.730093002319336
17849/28840	Do not believe what Albert is telling you countess so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated I take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as	58.082611083984375
17850/28840	Perhaps you are right said Morcerf meanwhile who is in the Russian ambassadors box   Which box do you mean asked the count	47.754878997802734
17851/28840	The one between the pillars on the first tierit seems to have been fitted up entirely af	88.32299041748047
17852/28840	Did you observe anyone during the first act asked ChâteauRen	26.194862365722656
17853/28840	No replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte Cristo that gained the prize   I am sure of	49.34678268432617
17854/28840	And who afterwards sent the cup to me   Und	113.42496490478516
17855/28840	But I dont know him said the countess I have a great mind to return	27.798959732055664
17856/28840	Do no such thing I beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic	120.20514678955078
17857/28840	It is his way and you must take him as you find	46.14604187011719
17858/28840	At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second	109.15257263183594
17859/28840	Albert rose to return to his	64.70471954345703
17860/28840	Shall I see you again asked the count	34.160823822021484
17861/28840	The young men bowed and quitted the	73.4762191772461
17862/28840	Upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian	150.59585571289062
17863/28840	A man of from thirtyfive to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern	95.66910552978516
17864/28840	The lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon	183.1634063720703
17865/28840	Hullo said Albert it is Monte Cristo and his Greek   The strangers were indeed no other than the count and Hayd	59.02710723876953
17866/28840	In a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent	88.34063720703125
17867/28840	The second act passed away during one continued buzz of voicesone deep whisperintimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary	284.8614196777344
17868/28840	At the close of the act he therefore went to the baron	45.293216705322266
17869/28840	Having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to Debr	27.538227081298828
17870/28840	By the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while Eugénie received him with her accustomed cold	102.94892883300781
17871/28840	My dear fellow said Debray you have come in the nick of	29.664400100708008
17872/28840	There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that I can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is	124.30854797363281
17873/28840	However I have turned the business over to Morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part I care nothing about the count or his mysterious do	84.1915054321289
17874/28840	30093m       I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32000 francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5000 francs	45.97877502441406
17875/28840	He seems to have a mania for diamonds said Morcerf smiling and I verily believe that like Potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as Tom Thumb did his flint	136.84547424316406
17876/28840	Perhaps he has discovered some mine said Madame Dangl	30.696943283081055
17877/28840	I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the barons banking establishment   I was not aware of it replied Albert but I can readily believe	36.44487380981445
17878/28840	And further that he stated to	334.96685791015625
17879/28840	Danglars his intention of only staying a year in Paris during which time he proposed to spend six	88.23286437988281

17881/28840	Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman	145.67471313476562
17882/28840	I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded Lucien raising his lorgnette to his	104.25537872314453
17883/28840	A most lovely creature upon my soul was his	345.1383972167969
17884/28840	So I should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that everyone here is as wellinformed as	73.80306243896484
17885/28840	Then your count entertains visitors does he asked Madame Dangl	54.78819274902344
17886/28840	Indeed he does and in a most lavish manner I can assure	81.90718841552734
17887/28840	Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner or something of the sort that he may be compelled to ask us in	57.851226806640625
17888/28840	What said Debray laughing do you really mean you would go to his house   Why not my husband could accompany	31.623857498168945
17889/28840	But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor   You have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful	68.03626251220703
17890/28840	No no exclaimed Debray that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his	91.5341567993164
17891/28840	Do you not recollect Morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast   Well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a	74.69210815429688

17898/28840	What do you think of the count inquired Debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good	58.09385681152344
17899/28840	The count repeated Eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the countoh he is so dreadfully	77.7459487915039
17900/28840	I quite agree with you said Morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find	45.397945404052734
17901/28840	The Countess G insists upon it that he is a	68.96957397460938
17902/28840	Then the Countess G has returned to Paris has she inquired the baron	37.77320861816406
17903/28840	Is that she mamma asked Eugénie almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair   Yes said Madame Danglars that is	52.03217697143555
17904/28840	Shall I tell you what you ought to do Morcerf   Command me mad	29.709945678710938
17905/28840	Well then you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to	52.06791687011719
17906/28840	What for Why to converse with him of	75.245849609375
17907/28840	Have you really no desire to meet him   None whatever replied Eugé	29.72454833984375
17908/28840	He will very probably come of his own accord said Morcer	89.99691772460938
17909/28840	There do you see madame he recognizes you and	80.38200378417969
17910/28840	The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful	83.97199249267578
17911/28840	Well said Morcerf I may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your	113.73004150390625
17912/28840	Adieu I will go and try if there are any means of speaking to	73.34390258789062
17913/28840	Go straight to his box that will be the simplest	113.854736328125
17914/28840	Presented to whom   To the beautiful	48.31419372558594
17915/28840	You say she is only a slave   While you assert that she is a queen or at least a	70.80854797363281
17916/28840	No I hope that when he sees me leave you he will come	78.40483856201172
17917/28840	I am going said Albert as he made his parting	86.41038513183594
17918/28840	Just as he was passing the counts box the door opened and Monte Cristo came	28.33185386657715
17919/28840	After giving some directions to Ali who stood in the lobby the count took Alberts	79.19800567626953
17920/28840	Carefully closing the box door Ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nub	189.9271697998047
17921/28840	Upon my word said Monte Cristo Paris is a strange city and the Parisians a very singular	48.144657135009766
17922/28840	See that cluster of persons collected around poor Ali who is as much astonished as themselves really one might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever be	182.11398315429688
17923/28840	Now I can promise you that a Frenchman might show himself in public either in Tunis Constantinople Bagdad or Cairo without being treated in that	121.17357635498047
17924/28840	That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of	276.96319580078125
17925/28840	However as far as Ali is concerned I can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendantyou who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in	108.72018432617188
17926/28840	Why if you sought concealment did you call your horse Vampa   That was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera I have been looking for him but without	72.26677703857422
17927/28840	In what part of the house   In the baronesss box I	28.053598403930664
17928/28840	That charming young woman with her is her daughter  	91.83818054199219
17929/28840	We will discuss that subject at length some future time said	235.1742401123047
17930/28840	But what do you think of the music   What music   Why the music you have been listening	28.77250099182129
17931/28840	Oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late Diogen	86.74759674072266
17932/28840	The conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for   No thank	263.8284912109375
17933/28840	To sleep after the manner I speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation   I knowthe famous hashish   Precise	89.11683654785156
17934/28840	So my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with	99.15421295166016
17935/28840	I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said Morcer	102.89567565917969
17936/28840	Do you mean at Rome   I	29.703990936279297
17937/28840	Ah then I suppose you heard Haydées guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native	217.8319091796875
17938/28840	Morcerf did not pursue the subject and Monte Cristo himself fell into a silent rever	77.02433776855469
17939/28840	The bell rang at this moment for the rising of the	94.9893569946289
17940/28840	You will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his	57.98622131347656
17941/28840	What Are you going   Pray say everything that is kind to Countess G on the part of her friend the	52.39198303222656
17942/28840	And what message shall I convey to the baroness   That with her permission I shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the	47.88507843017578
17943/28840	The third act had begun and during its progress the Count of Morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of Madame Dangl	34.16112518310547
17944/28840	The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated	57.159603118896484
17945/28840	The quick eye of Monte Cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his	132.2209930419922
17946/28840	Haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or	154.94589233398438
17947/28840	30099m       The third act passed off as	40.51593017578125
17948/28840	After which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and	181.45416259765625
17949/28840	The count left his box and a moment later was saluting the Baronne Danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and	60.13528060913086
17950/28840	You are welcome count she exclaimed as he	154.55975341796875
17951/28840	I have been most anxious to see you that I might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill	123.09117889404297
17952/28840	Surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your	293.635498046875
17953/28840	Believe me madame I had entirely forgotten	131.49354553222656
17954/28840	But it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend Madame de Villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to	46.637916564941406
17955/28840	30101m       This time at least I do not deserve your	32.933570861816406
17956/28840	It was Ali my Nubian slave who rendered this service to Madame de Ville	42.16560363769531
17957/28840	May I beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter   Oh you are no strangerat least not by name replied Madame Danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but	37.296226501464844
17958/28840	Eugénie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the Count of Monte Crist	17.270824432373047
17959/28840	The count bowed while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head	23.322256088256836
17960/28840	You have a charming young person with you tonight count said Eugé	69.93236541748047
17961/28840	Is she your daughter   No mademoiselle said Monte Cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the	30.30240249633789
17962/28840	She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my	330.49169921875
17963/28840	And what is her name   Haydée replied Monte Crist	12.752134323120117
17964/28840	A Greek murmured the Count of Morcer	14.944681167602539
17965/28840	There said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as Haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to Morcerfs	52.47273635864258
17966/28840	It was as if the young girl beheld the head of Med	52.338523864746094
17967/28840	She bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her	159.60147094726562
17968/28840	The sound was heard by the people about Ali who instantly opened the box	126.67282104492188
17969/28840	Why count exclaimed Eugénie what has happened to your ward she seems to have been taken suddenly	94.36580657958984
17970/28840	But do not be alarmed on her	42.63566207885742
17971/28840	Haydées nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowersnay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her	241.73294067382812
17972/28840	However continued Monte Cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket I have an infallible	39.370601654052734
17973/28840	So saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count and left Madame Danglars	33.24047088623047
17974/28840	Upon his return to Haydée he found her still very	57.15009307861328
17975/28840	As soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy	101.75322723388672
17976/28840	Who was it you were talking with over there she	242.6287078857422
17977/28840	With the Count of Morcerf answered Monte Crist	12.242573738098145
17978/28840	He tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to	122.91006469726562
17979/28840	You shall relate them to me my	103.72005462646484
17980/28840	They are no doubt both curious and	319.2004089355469
17981/28840	I feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful	91.67961883544922
17982/28840	So saying Haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth	71.87360382080078
17983/28840	Do you observe said the Countess G to Albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people he listens most devoutly to the third act of _Robert le Diable_ and when the fourth begins takes his	77.5999526977539
17984/28840	He came to renew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed Baronne Danglars _née_ Hermine de Servie	52.43399429321289
17985/28840	Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to	107.42886352539062
17986/28840	He was convinced that Luciens visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la Chaussée dAnt	59.60784149169922
17987/28840	But the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between Luciens visit and the curiosity of the baron	49.88214874267578
17988/28840	You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars the count inquired of Albert de Morcer	22.950220108032227
17989/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo I did not expect that the affair would be so promptly	30.922740936279297
17990/28840	Oh things take their course without our	203.11537170410156
17991/28840	While we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed	189.64898681640625
17992/28840	Danglars served together in Spain my father in the army and	68.06958770751953
17993/28840	It was there that my father ruined by the revolution and	117.16673278808594
17994/28840	Danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different	68.80612182617188
17995/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo I think	15.888914108276367
17996/28840	Very pretty or rather very beautiful replied Albert but of that style of beauty which I do not appreciate I am an ungrateful	113.24932861328125
17997/28840	You speak as if you were already her	95.82511138916016
17998/28840	Ah returned Albert in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was	58.186309814453125
17999/28840	Really said Monte Cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this	26.090900421142578
18000/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me replied Morcerf and that frightens	14.640206336975098
18001/28840	Bah exclaimed Monte Cristo thats a fine reason to	60.25684356689453
18002/28840	Are you not rich yourself   My fathers income is about 50000 francs per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when I	45.641937255859375
18003/28840	That perhaps might not be considered a large sum in Paris especially said the count but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in	65.25304412841797
18004/28840	As for me I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble	44.08362579345703
18005/28840	Albert shook his head and looked	51.89299011230469
18006/28840	There is still something else said	100.16980743408203
18007/28840	I confess observed Monte Cristo that I have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and	75.60601043701172
18008/28840	Oh said Morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my	51.05367660522461
18009/28840	Whence can it arise then for you told me your father desired the	200.12889099121094
18010/28840	It is my mother who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed	182.90933227539062
18011/28840	I cannot account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Dangl	52.65348815917969
18012/28840	I do not know if that is her reason said Albert but one thing I do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite	58.97150802612305
18013/28840	There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but I had such a sudden attack of indisposition   Real interrupted the count	66.85768127441406
18014/28840	Oh real enough from anxiety doubtlessat any rate they postponed the matter for two	549.4129028320312
18015/28840	I am not yet twentyone and Eugénie is only seventeen but the two months expire next	68.4187240600586
18016/28840	My dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is	87.99069213867188
18017/28840	Marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the	202.2442169189453
18018/28840	Yes replied Morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive	108.54814910888672
18019/28840	Then do not marry her said the	46.419105529785156
18020/28840	Monte Cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last	246.25726318359375
18021/28840	I am doing a little sum in	86.5018310546875
18022/28840	9     When they tell me such things I only shrug my shoulders and say	46.51519012451172
18023/28840	But you were speaking of Haitians said Monte Crist	43.21152114868164
18024/28840	Ah Haitiansthat is quite another thing Haitians are the _écarté_ of French stockjob	97.46450805664062
18025/28840	Danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300000 franc	62.61096954345703
18026/28840	Had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300000 francs he would have lost 20 or 25	106.01033782958984
18027/28840	And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 asked Monte Crist	131.0986785888672
18028/28840	I am profoundly ignorant of all these stockjobbing intrig	77.13099670410156
18029/28840	Because said Albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between	197.33334350585938
18030/28840	Ah said the count I see that	32.000396728515625
18031/28840	Danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300000 francs in a day he must be enormously	53.37559509277344
18032/28840	It is not he who plays exclaimed Lucien it is Madame Danglars she is indeed	45.76103591918945
18033/28840	But you who are a reasonable being Lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountainhead surely you ought to prevent it said Morcerf with a	49.61644744873047
18034/28840	How can I if her husband fails in controlling her asked Lucien you know the character of the baronessno one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she ple	96.6042251586914
18035/28840	Ah if I were in your place said	46.52366256713867
18036/28840	Well   I would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future sonin	55.09006118774414
18037/28840	How would you set about it   Ah that would be easy enoughI would give her a	61.743675231933594
18038/28840	Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your	205.7624053955078
18039/28840	Cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prud	47.403846740722656
18040/28840	It is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation tell her some fine morning an unheardof piece of intelligencesome telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession for instance that Henri	132.47979736328125
18041/28840	We can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the PontNe	71.78208923339844
18042/28840	Monte Cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the	165.97637939453125
18043/28840	This embarrassment had completely escaped Albert but it caused Lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at	162.96180725097656
18044/28840	The count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered Willingly count I	116.46822357177734
18045/28840	Do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your motherinlaw in the presence of	56.7415657043457
18046/28840	Debray   My dear count said Morcerf I beg of you not to apply that title so	21.94846534729004
18047/28840	Now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage   So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not I think visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole	65.21846008300781
18048/28840	Then said the count I am emboldened to speak openly to	43.6330680847168
18049/28840	de Villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render	53.08744812011719
18050/28840	I predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and rout	168.75558471679688
18051/28840	Now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them I have if agreeable to you thought of inviting	134.26443481445312
18052/28840	and Madame de Villefort to my countryhouse at Auteu	15.901030540466309
18053/28840	In that case your mother would hold me in aversion and I do not at all wish that on the contrary I desire to stand high in her	77.23514556884766
18054/28840	Indeed count said Morcerf I thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you	98.4029541015625

18060/28840	Well said he to Morcerf but I think your father will not be the only angry one	61.562259674072266
18061/28840	and Madame Danglars will think me a very illmannered	58.09953689575195
18062/28840	They know that I am intimate with youthat you are in fact one of the oldest of my Parisian acquaintancesand they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why I did not invite	50.198726654052734
18063/28840	Be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in	198.7597198486328

18080/28840	She is a remarkable woman and I only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger in that case I assure you there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcer	60.77828598022461
18081/28840	As to my father you will not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referend	73.29023742675781

18094/28840	I had no previous knowledge of your visit had I   Indeed you are such an extraordinary person that I would not answer for	69.16226959228516
18095/28840	At all events I could not guess that you would invite me to	51.98804473876953

18105/28840	He is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in Italy descendants of very ancient	149.75608825683594
18106/28840	I have met him several times at Florence Bologna and Lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in	59.289588928222656
18107/28840	This good Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire when he was on his way to	51.38851547241211

18111/28840	Have you Is he still amusing himself in Italy   I believe so however he regrets your absence	124.46566772460938
18112/28840	He says you were the sun of Rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it	75.9822769165039
18113/28840	His opinion of me is altered for the better then   No he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of	130.1092987060547
18114/28840	He is a charming young man said Monte Cristo and I felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when I met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of	53.63779830932617
18115/28840	He is I think the son of General dÉpinay   He	20.416505813598633
18116/28840	The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815   By the Bonapart	66.03290557861328
18117/28840	Really I like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him   Yes he is to marry Mademoiselle de Ville	33.28278350830078

18119/28840	Why do you do so   I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my	61.95820999145508
18120/28840	But really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us it is unpardon	149.77052307128906

18124/28840	Monsieur Baptistin especially I could never get such a man as	45.0467529296875
18125/28840	My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner	210.69606018066406
18126/28840	Baptistin give me the refusal of	502.3583068847656
18127/28840	Ah ha you will do as much as that will you  	54.0041618347168

18130/28840	Nothing is impossible gravely replied Monte Cristo and taking leave of Albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three	62.284873962402344
18131/28840	Monsieur Bertuccio you understand that I intend entertaining company on Saturday at Auteu	35.09858322143555
18132/28840	I shall require your services to see that all be properly	133.9501953125
18133/28840	It is a beautiful house or at all events may be made	62.67181396484375
18134/28840	There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very	62.971187591552734
18135/28840	Let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleepingchamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it	68.43480682373047

18138/28840	I should be glad however to receive your excellencys commands concerning the	57.38154220581055
18139/28840	Bertuccio said the count since you have been in Paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand	57.52523422241211
18140/28840	But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive   I do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do	38.907958984375
18141/28840	Lucullus dines with Lucullus that is quite	94.83248901367188
18142/28840	Major Cavalcanti   Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for declining Alberts	46.691932678222656
18143/28840	Seven oclock had just struck and	84.72378540039062
18144/28840	Bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for Auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its	86.57404327392578
18145/28840	The visitor was about fiftytwo years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over	87.02713012695312
18146/28840	Such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at	58.06159210205078
18147/28840	30 in the Avenue des ChampsÉlysées that the Count of Monte Cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the	31.494888305664062
18148/28840	The small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the	91.92598724365234
18149/28840	Therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his	71.74700164794922
18150/28840	He was ushered into a simple and elegant drawingroom and the count rose to meet him with a smiling	52.90959930419922
18151/28840	Ah my dear sir you are most welcome I was expecting	55.19923782348633
18152/28840	Indeed said the Italian was your excellency then aware of my visit   Yes I had been told that I should see you today at seven o	30.287334442138672
18153/28840	Then you have received full information concerning my arrival   Of	90.05358123779297
18154/28840	Ah so much the better I feared this little precaution might have been	59.96261978149414
18155/28840	30119m       What precaution   That of informing you beforehand of my	36.078392028808594
18156/28840	But you are sure you are not	26.967487335205078
18157/28840	It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven oclock this evening   I will prove it to you beyond a	58.94733428955078
18158/28840	Oh no never mind that said the Italian it is not worth the	85.73503112792969
18159/28840	Let me see said the count are you not the Marquis Bartolomeo Cavalcanti   Bartolomeo Cavalcanti joyfully replied the Italian yes I am really	19.825551986694336
18160/28840	Exmajor in the Austrian service   Was I a major timidly asked the old	179.12461853027344
18161/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo you were a major that is the title the French give to the post which you filled in	87.4177474975586
18162/28840	Very good said the major I do not demand more you understand   Your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it said Monte Crist	46.22528839111328
18163/28840	You were sent by some other person  	33.60128402709961
18164/28840	By the excellent Abbé Busoni   Exactly so said the delighted	43.52912902832031
18165/28840	And you have a letter   Yes there it	24.93896484375
18166/28840	And Monte Cristo took the letter which he opened and	30.53984260559082
18167/28840	The major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the	52.30386734008789
18168/28840	Major Cavalcanti a worthy patrician of Lucca a descendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence continued Monte Cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a	88.53572082519531
18169/28840	Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper and	128.4802703857422
18170/28840	Half a million said he magnificent   Half a million is it said the	76.98431396484375
18171/28840	Yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in	59.69667053222656
18172/28840	Be it half a million then but on my word of honor I had no idea that it was so	41.15956497192383
18173/28840	Because you are robbed by your stew	81.59673309326172
18174/28840	You must make some reformation in that	207.59783935546875
18175/28840	You have opened my eyes said the Italian gravely I will show the gentlemen the	86.05573272705078
18176/28840	Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter   And who only needs one thing more to make him	90.58455657958984
18177/28840	Yes indeed but one said the major with a	48.35422897338867
18178/28840	Which is to recover a lost and adored	134.8394317626953
18179/28840	A lost and adored son   Stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gyps	99.55738830566406
18180/28840	At the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to	50.22392654418945
18181/28840	The count continued   I have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen	72.95394134521484
18182/28840	The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of	21.513713836669922
18183/28840	I have the power of so doing said Monte Crist	16.186208724975586
18184/28840	Ah true said Monte Cristo there is a post	20.8988094329834
18185/28840	In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker I send him a draft for 2000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48000 francs which you still owe	81.19854736328125
18186/28840	The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great	123.61543273925781
18187/28840	He said very good muttered the major thensir replied	481.0157470703125
18188/28840	Then the postscript   Well what of the postscript   Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter   Certainly the Abbé Busoni and myself have a small account open between	43.268123626708984
18189/28840	I do not remember if it is exactly 48000 francs which I am still owing him but I dare say we shall not dispute the	56.60719680786133
18190/28840	Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said Monte Crist	72.71070098876953
18191/28840	Why really I know no one said the	56.74746322631836
18192/28840	But then you yourself are known to others   Yes I am known so that   Proceed my dear Monsieur Cavalc	32.3726806640625
18193/28840	So that you will remit to me these 48000 francs   Certainly at your first	39.805702209472656
18194/28840	The majors eyes dilated with pleasing aston	256.7799987792969
18195/28840	But sit down said Monte Cristo really I do not know what I have been thinking ofI have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an	37.0528678894043
18196/28840	The major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat	135.29916381835938
18197/28840	Now said the count what will you takea glass of sherry port or Alicante   Alicante if you please it is my favorite	64.63660430908203

18202/28840	Into what room did you take him   Into the blue drawingroom according to your excellencys	60.319801330566406
18203/28840	Thats right now bring the Alicante and some	487.0533142089844
18204/28840	Really said the major I am quite ashamed of the trouble I am giving	47.43098068237305
18205/28840	Pray dont mention such a thing said the	164.81687927246094
18206/28840	Baptistin reentered with glasses wine and	410.6112365722656
18207/28840	The count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the rubycolored	186.39126586914062
18208/28840	The bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a mans	196.6796417236328
18209/28840	The major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a bisc	200.25994873046875
18210/28840	The count told Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the	60.82194137573242
18211/28840	30123m       So sir you lived at Lucca did you You were rich noble held in great esteemhad all that could render a man happy   All said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively	92.88800048828125
18212/28840	And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness   Only one thing said the	66.85560607910156
18213/28840	And that one thing your lost	629.150390625
18214/28840	Ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my happiness was indeed	60.11928176879883
18215/28840	The worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and	154.33004760742188
18216/28840	Let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for I always understood you were a	151.42422485351562
18217/28840	That was the general opinion sir said the major and I   Yes replied the count and you confirmed the	49.523414611816406
18218/28840	Yes said the major I did wish this fault to be hidden from every	93.91797637939453
18219/28840	Not on your own account surely replied Monte Cristo for a man is above that sort of thing   Oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the	39.53457260131836
18220/28840	But for the sake of the mother said the	29.537628173828125
18221/28840	Yes for the mothers sakehis poor mother cried the major taking a third bisc	115.85919952392578
18222/28840	Take some more wine my dear Cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of Alicante your emotion has quite overcome	82.36138153076172
18223/28840	His poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false	92.356689453125
18224/28840	She belonged to one of the first families in Italy I think did she not   She was of a noble family of Fiesole	97.86388397216797
18225/28840	And her name was   Do you desire to know her name   Oh said Monte Cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for I already know	27.06549644470215
18226/28840	The count knows everything said the Italian b	161.24612426757812
18227/28840	Oliva Corsinari was it not   Oliva Corsinari   A marchioness   A marchioness   And you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family   Yes that was the way it	34.419677734375
18228/28840	And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you said Monte Crist	45.96342849731445
18229/28840	What papers   The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari and the register of your childs	44.80296325683594
18230/28840	The register of my childs birth   The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcantiof your son is not his name Andrea   I believe so said the	72.90045928955078
18231/28840	What You believe so   I dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a	59.87239074707031
18232/28840	Well then said Monte Cristo you have all the documents with you   Your excellency I regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers I neglected to bring	38.416099548339844
18233/28840	Were they then so necessary   They were	135.011474609375
18234/28840	The major passed his hand across his	47.27605438232422
18235/28840	Ah _perbacco_ indispensable were they   Certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child   True said the major there might be doubts	76.24493408203125
18236/28840	In that case your son would be very unpleasantly	122.31785583496094
18237/28840	It would be fatal to his	121.91024780273438
18238/28840	It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial	86.996337890625
18239/28840	_O peccato_   You must know that in France they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in Italy to go to the priest and say We love each other and want you to marry	101.47631072998047
18240/28840	Marriage is a civil affair in France and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your	177.3870849609375
18241/28840	That is the misfortune You see I have not these necessary	238.0503387451172
18242/28840	Fortunately I have them though said Monte Crist	28.330078125
18243/28840	You have them   I have	47.98381042480469
18244/28840	I do not at all wonder at itone cannot think of everything but happily the Abbé Busoni thought for	64.9029769897461
18245/28840	He is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you   Here they	27.67108154296875
18246/28840	The major clasped his hands in token of	55.34915542602539
18247/28840	You married Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del MonteCattini here is the priests	120.48668670654297
18248/28840	Yes indeed there it is truly said the Italian looking on with aston	100.6865234375
18249/28840	And here is Andrea Cavalcantis baptismal register given by the curé of Sarave	97.39718627929688
18250/28840	Take these documents then they do not concern	92.51068878173828
18251/28840	You will give them to your son who will of course take great care of	80.38687133789062
18252/28840	I should think so indeed If he were to lose them   Well and if he were to lose them said Monte Crist	42.339080810546875
18253/28840	In that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be	47.303253173828125
18254/28840	It would be a difficult matter to arrange said Monte Crist	30.781049728393555
18255/28840	I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these	28.515810012817383
18256/28840	Now said Monte Cristo as to the mother of the young man   As to the mother of the young man repeated the Italian with	23.936973571777344
18257/28840	I knew that said Monte Cristo she has been dead these ten	40.8409423828125
18258/28840	And I am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right	148.27981567382812
18259/28840	What would you have said Monte Cristo we are all	25.583097457885742
18260/28840	Now you understand my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in France that you have been separated from your son for fifteen	26.816017150878906
18261/28840	Stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be	102.0736083984375
18262/28840	You sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the Parisian	68.91017150878906
18263/28840	That is the reason which has induced you to leave Via Reggio where you have lived since the death of your	93.9859390258789
18264/28840	If they should hear of the separation   Ah yes what could I say   That an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family   By the Corsinari   Precise	62.47756576538086
18265/28840	Had stolen away this child in order that your name might become	188.33578491210938
18266/28840	That is reasonable since he is an only	179.1223907470703
18267/28840	Well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be	187.8375701904297
18268/28840	You have doubtless already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you   An agreeable one asked the	107.87159729003906
18269/28840	Ah I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his	53.96198272705078
18270/28840	Someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was	99.9144515991211
18271/28840	That who was here   Your childyour sonyour Andrea   I did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible cool	91.90406799316406
18272/28840	Then he is here   He is said Monte Cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his	20.21337127685547
18273/28840	Ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each ex	72.83760070800781
18274/28840	My dear sir said Monte Cristo I understand your emotion you must have time to recover	32.29014205932617
18275/28840	I will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this muchdesired interview for I presume that he is not less impatient for it than	94.91002655029297
18276/28840	I should quite imagine that to be the case said Cavalc	59.203224182128906
18277/28840	Well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with	22.659467697143555
18278/28840	You will bring him then You carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself   No I do not wish to come between a father and	58.22005844116211
18279/28840	But do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you cannot well mistake him he will enter by this	128.3326416015625
18280/28840	He is a fine young man of fair complexiona little too fair perhapspleasing in manners but you will see and judge for	125.27706909179688
18281/28840	By the way said the major you know I have only the 2000 francs which the Abbé Busoni sent me this sum I have expended upon travelling expenses and   And you want money that is a matter of course my dear	42.646846771240234
18282/28840	Well here are 8000 francs on	140.55274963378906
18283/28840	It is 40000 francs which I now owe you said Monte Crist	24.576017379760742
18284/28840	Does your excellency wish for a receipt said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his	43.43838119506836
18285/28840	I thought you might want it to show the Abbé Bus	23.64280128479004
18286/28840	Well when you receive the remaining 40000 you shall give me a receipt in	111.93585968017578
18287/28840	Between honest men such excessive precaution is I think quite	345.5217590332031
18288/28840	Yes so it is between perfectly upright	547.4367065429688
18289/28840	You will permit me to make one remark   Certainly pray do	40.69241714477539
18290/28840	Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of	143.7132110595703
18291/28840	Indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete	77.54720306396484
18292/28840	It may be worn at Via Reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in	219.47006225585938
18293/28840	Oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave	72.68019104003906
18294/28840	But what shall I wear   What you find in your tr	69.03544616699219
18295/28840	In my trunks I have but one portmante	38.38261032104492
18296/28840	I dare say you have nothing else with	74.45631408691406
18297/28840	What is the use of boring ones self with so many things Besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as	106.17743682861328
18298/28840	But you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before	83.03553009033203
18299/28840	It has arrived at the Hôtel des Princes Rue de Richel	10.32657241821289
18300/28840	It is there you are to take up your	70.43485260009766
18301/28840	Then in these trunks   I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to needyour plain clothes and your	46.55892562866211
18302/28840	On grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very	186.8797607421875
18303/28840	They still laugh at them in France and yet always wear them for all	115.19401550292969
18304/28840	Very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the	57.487831115722656
18305/28840	Now said Monte Cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear	85.73102569580078
18306/28840	Saying which Monte Cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the	66.59638977050781
18307/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti   The Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room which Baptistin had designated as the drawingroom and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour	36.11121368408203
18308/28840	Baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for adm	102.3687973022461
18309/28840	He was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to	117.92041778564453
18310/28840	When the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the goldheaded cane which he held in his	59.94852828979492
18311/28840	On perceiving the count he rose	44.28841018676758
18312/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo I believe said	17.12990379333496
18313/28840	Yes sir and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea Cavalcanti   Count Andrea Cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a	23.537185668945312
18314/28840	You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the	42.409217834472656
18315/28840	I did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so	104.1595230102539
18316/28840	The letter signed Sinbad the Sailor is it not   Exactly	33.88402557373047
18317/28840	Ah indeed Then that explains everything that is extraordinary said	196.8175506591797
18318/28840	He is then the same Englishman whom I metatahyes	147.65695190429688
18319/28840	Well monsieur I am at your	9.075708389282227
18320/28840	If what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family   Certainly I will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready	43.90971755981445
18321/28840	I am as you have said the Count Andrea Cavalcanti son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti a descendant of the Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at	25.774198532104492
18322/28840	Since I have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master I have been constantly seeking him but all in	117.0404281616211
18323/28840	At length I received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in Paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting	83.85347747802734
18324/28840	Really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said Monte Cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend Sinbad for your father is indeed here and is seeking	53.148502349853516
18325/28840	The expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now	47.6063232421875
18326/28840	Ah yes that is the name	172.32318115234375
18327/28840	And you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here   Yes sir and I can even add that I have only just left his	26.590984344482422
18328/28840	The history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic	192.4628143310547
18329/28840	At length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of	102.45919799804688
18330/28840	Your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of Piedmont with a passport signed for	81.47810363769531
18331/28840	You were in the south of France I think   Yes replied Andrea with an embarrassed air I was in the south of	33.5087890625
18332/28840	30133m       Indeed Then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this	49.78425979614258
18333/28840	But said Andrea if my father had met me I doubt if he would have recognized me I must be somewhat altered since he last saw	91.43561553955078
18334/28840	Oh the voice of nature said Monte Crist	29.40669822692871
18335/28840	True interrupted the young man I had not looked upon it in that	53.891475677490234
18336/28840	Sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded I hope no false report   As for myself I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore the philanthrop	82.5589599609375
18337/28840	I believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for I did not ask not being inquis	72.40008544921875
18338/28840	Your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been	60.21401596069336
18339/28840	He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found	58.49733352661133
18340/28840	He did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future	126.15341186523438
18341/28840	I am quite aware that my friend Wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and I have promised to adhere to his	73.57546997070312
18342/28840	Now sir pray do not be offended at the question I am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your	60.29829025268555
18343/28840	I have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in Asia Minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman	115.1192855834961
18344/28840	Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from	137.9258575439453
18345/28840	Besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette I suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my	90.22026062011719
18346/28840	Well said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if I were you I would not divulge a word of these	54.93573760986328
18347/28840	Your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like	218.4388427734375
18348/28840	This is the kind of difficulty which I wished to represent to you my dear	50.44175338745117

18352/28840	I agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely	44.737056732177734
18353/28840	Nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said Monte Cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into	76.74618530273438
18354/28840	You must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former	136.04151916503906
18355/28840	However your excellency said Andrea in consideration of Lord Wilmore by whom I was recommended to you   Yes certainly interrupted Monte Cristo but Lord Wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear	25.61092758178711

18358/28840	He is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his uniform but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the Austrian service all that will be pard	60.193115234375
18359/28840	We are not generally very severe with the Aust	148.473388671875
18360/28840	In short you will find your father a very presentable person I assure	107.72438049316406
18361/28840	Ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that I have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all	53.861663818359375
18362/28840	He is a millionairehis income is 500000 franc	92.13170623779297

18379/28840	Andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining	70.21598052978516
18380/28840	The young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching	69.34551239013672
18381/28840	Ah my dear father said Andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you   How do you do my dear son said the major grave	25.100788116455078
18382/28840	After so many years of painful separation said Andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again   Indeed it is after so long a	58.220394134521484

18387/28840	The fact is said the young man that I should be exceedingly grieved to leave	47.395870208740234
18388/28840	As for me you must know I cannot possibly live out of Lucca therefore I shall return to Italy as soon as I	61.41038513183594

18390/28840	Certainly I am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but I had resolved on giving them into your hands and if I had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my	82.63008880615234
18391/28840	Where are these papers then   Here they	45.217647552490234
18392/28840	Whywhat do you mean by that question   I mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as	55.13923263549805
18393/28840	In France my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to Toulon for five years for change of	105.25675201416016

18395/28840	Make yourself easy we are quite alone said Andrea besides we are conversing in	90.03834533691406
18396/28840	Well then replied the major they paid me 50000 francs	75.2509765625

18398/28840	You have then been induced to alter your opinion you have had some proofs of their truth The major drew from his pocket a handful of	86.38999938964844
18399/28840	Most palpable proofs said he as you may	201.10789489746094

18403/28840	Whom do you mean by they   _Ma foi_ I can hardly tell but I was alluding to those who wrote the letter you received one did you not  	51.68434524536133
18404/28840	From whom   From a certain Abbé Bus	22.09891700744629

18407/28840	Then read for yourself and the major gave a letter into the young mans	73.7170639038086

18430/28840	At all events it is neither you nor	53.955718994140625
18431/28840	Well then   Why it does not much concern us do you think it does   No I agree with you	36.20035934448242

18437/28840	Well marquis said Monte Cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to	52.4647331237793
18438/28840	Ah your excellency I am overwhelmed with	29.057212829589844

18441/28840	Happy father happy son said the	186.18775939941406
18442/28840	There is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so	94.56318664550781

18472/28840	At what hour shall we come asked the young	58.79650115966797
18473/28840	We will be with you at that time said the	44.83931350708008
18474/28840	The two Cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the	44.54713439941406
18475/28840	Monte Cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in	159.54934692382812
18476/28840	There go two miscreants said he it is a pity they are not really related Then after an instant of gloomy reflection Come I will go to see the Morrels said he I think that disgust is even more sickening than	126.0787124633789
18477/28840	In the Lucern Patch   Our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding	128.81121826171875
18478/28840	de Villeforts house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnuttrees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our	69.19165802001953
18479/28840	This time Maximilian was the first to	34.965232849121094
18480/28840	He was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel	102.81307983398438
18481/28840	At length the longdesired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching	113.09493255615234
18482/28840	The delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eugénie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was	43.94288635253906
18483/28840	The young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comfort	86.61495208740234
18484/28840	It is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man Valentine did not suffer by the	60.925018310546875
18485/28840	In about half an hour the girls went away and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars visit had at last come to an	31.01905632019043
18486/28840	In a few minutes Valentine reentered the garden	71.92584991455078
18487/28840	Goodevening Maximilian I know I have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my	70.67540740966797
18488/28840	I was not aware that you were so intimate with	31.68484878540039
18489/28840	Who told you we were intimate Maximilian   No one but you appeared to be	40.63461685180664
18490/28840	From the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two schoolgirls telling your secrets to each	124.55823516845703
18491/28840	We were having a confidential conversation returned Valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with	117.3499526977539
18492/28840	de Morcerf and I on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying	64.50460815429688
18493/28840	Dear Valentine   That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and Eugénie as in speaking of the man whom I could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were	60.393531799316406
18494/28840	Ah how good you are to say so Valentine You possess a quality which can never belong to Mademoiselle Dangl	37.0048942565918
18495/28840	It is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we	110.46987915039062
18496/28840	It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that	133.09031677246094
18497/28840	No Valentine I assure you such is not the	91.3853988647461
18498/28840	I was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars I cannot understand how any man can really love	55.65414047241211
18499/28840	The fact is Maximilian that I was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your	92.12195587158203
18500/28840	No but tell meit is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle Danglars   I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to	30.917736053466797
18501/28840	It only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted	205.2291717529297
18502/28840	You cannot at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each	102.05424499511719
18503/28840	If we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of	102.25508880615234

18505/28840	de Morcerf on account of loving another   I told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with Eugé	43.84527587890625
18506/28840	Yes but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate own now that you did question her on the	347.04168701171875
18507/28840	If you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight	94.12187957763672
18508/28840	Ah you see   Well what does that prove asked	45.53434753417969
18509/28840	Then why did you smile   Why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself	43.84225845336914
18510/28840	Do you want me to go away   Ah no	39.69729232788086
18511/28840	But do not let us lose time you are the subject on which I wish to	34.52543640136719
18512/28840	True we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass	107.32543182373047
18513/28840	Yes you are right I am but a poor friend to	37.56709289550781
18514/28840	What a life I cause you to lead poor Maximilian you who are formed for happiness I bitterly reproach myself I assure	105.58147430419922
18515/28840	You must hope for us both Maximilian that will make me at least partly	110.21133422851562
18516/28840	But why must you leave me so soon   I do not know	54.15871047973633
18517/28840	I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune	54.1370849609375
18518/28840	Let them take my fortune I am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quiet	116.07015228271484
18519/28840	You would love me as much if I were poor would you not Maximilian   Oh I shall always love	45.67221450805664
18520/28840	What should I care for either riches or poverty if my Valentine was near me and I felt certain that no one could deprive me of her But do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage   I do not think that is the	66.31309509277344
18521/28840	However it may be Valentine you must not be	61.68752670288086
18522/28840	I assure you that as long as I live I shall never love anyone else   Do you think to reassure me when you say that Maximilian   Pardon me you are	27.895030975341797
18523/28840	But I was going to tell you that I met	31.2948055267334
18524/28840	Well   Monsieur Franz is his friend you	31.399856567382812
18525/28840	What then   Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz announcing his immediate	31.42038345336914
18526/28840	Valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the	50.232330322265625
18527/28840	Ah heavens if it were that But no the communication would not come through Madame de Ville	90.29570770263672
18528/28840	Why not   BecauseI scarcely know whybut it has appeared as if Madame de Villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose	84.49712371826172
18529/28840	Is it so Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Ville	37.36533737182617
18530/28840	Do not be in such a hurry to do that said Valentine with a sad	44.6383056640625
18531/28840	If she objects to your marrying	341.1943664550781
18532/28840	dÉpinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other	70.92681884765625
18533/28840	No Maximilian it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort objects it is marriage	68.5898208618164
18534/28840	Marriage If she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself   You do not understand me Maximil	67.12706756591797
18535/28840	About a year ago I talked of retiring to a	145.23138427734375
18536/28840	Madame de Villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the	84.22708129882812
18537/28840	You can form no idea of the expression of that old mans eye when he looks at me the only person in the world whom he loves and I had almost said by whom he is beloved in	74.72335052490234
18538/28840	When he learned my resolution I shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless	112.57196807861328
18539/28840	Ah Maximilian I experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet I exclaimedForgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather they may do what they will with me I will never leave	93.53567504882812
18540/28840	When I had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a	41.900516510009766
18541/28840	Ah Maximilian I may have much to suffer but I feel as if my grandfathers look at that moment would more than compensate for	47.364158630371094
18542/28840	Noirtier evidently intends making me his	286.7893981933594
18543/28840	My brother Edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with	203.84742736816406
18544/28840	Now if I had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his	73.39344024658203
18545/28840	Ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avar	103.01615142822266
18546/28840	It is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal	145.7129364013672
18547/28840	No human being not even my sister is aware of its	212.35728454589844
18548/28840	Valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you   Valentine	43.36980438232422
18549/28840	A friend Maximilian and who is this friend I tremble to give my	64.02386474609375
18550/28840	Well that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first saw that extraordinary	153.62203979492188
18551/28840	Extraordinary did you say  	103.8802261352539
18552/28840	You have known him for some time then   Scarcely longer than eight or ten	46.12944412231445
18553/28840	And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days Ah Maximilian I had hoped you set a higher value on the title of	78.58381652832031
18554/28840	Your logic is most powerful Valentine but say what you will I can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my	153.13670349121094
18555/28840	He must be a prophet then said Valentine	66.00796508789062
18556/28840	Indeed said Maximilian I have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future	67.52572631835938
18557/28840	Ah said Valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man Maximilian he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all I have	56.929405212402344
18558/28840	My poor girl you know him	253.81201171875
18559/28840	I know him   Yes it was he who saved the life of your stepmother and her	30.305219650268555
18560/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo   The	11.568976402282715
18561/28840	Ah cried Valentine he is too much the friend of Madame de Villefort ever to be	36.255340576171875
18562/28840	The friend of Madame de Villefort It cannot be surely Valentine you are mistaken   No indeed I am not for I assure you his power over our household is almost	59.108585357666016
18563/28840	de Monte Cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our	90.8272476196289
18564/28840	If such be the case my dear Valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his	111.27570343017578
18565/28840	This man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and	391.5916442871094
18566/28840	I never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnific	218.84022521972656
18567/28840	His smile is so sweet when he addresses me that I forget it ever can be bitter to	149.00946044921875
18568/28840	Ah Valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles if so depend on it you will be	85.0876693725586
18569/28840	Me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if I accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid	141.19540405273438
18570/28840	You say he loves you Maximilian how do you know that he does All would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with	107.45289611816406
18571/28840	Ah Valentine I assure you you are	60.08234405517578
18572/28840	Who knows but that in order to please Madame de Villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power It is not just that he should despise me so without any	60.394371032714844
18573/28840	Ah forgive me said Valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on Maximilian I have done wrong for I have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even know existed in my	75.1286849975586
18574/28840	I do not deny the influence of which you speak or that I have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than	78.55197143554688
18575/28840	Well Valentine said Morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter	52.318084716796875
18576/28840	I will not make a confidant of	33.7913818359375
18577/28840	Alas said Valentine I see that I have given you	64.8810043334961
18578/28840	I can only say how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved	69.38047790527344
18579/28840	But indeed I am not prejudiced beyond the power of	101.3058853149414
18580/28840	Tell me what this Count of Monte Cristo has done for	41.225738525390625
18581/28840	30157m       I own that your question embarrasses me Valentine for I cannot say that the count has rendered me any ostensible	47.7677116394043
18582/28840	Still as I have already told you I have an instinctive affection for him the source of which I cannot explain to	27.56822967529297
18583/28840	Has the sun done anything for me No he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that I see younothing	189.50741577148438
18584/28840	Has such and such a perfume done anything for me No its odor charms one of my sensesthat is all I can say when I am asked why I praise	138.14459228515625
18585/28840	My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for	177.076416015625
18586/28840	A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of	116.53460693359375
18587/28840	In his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts I find a relation to my	123.75763702392578
18588/28840	You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you that ever since I have known this man I have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from	57.085845947265625
18589/28840	However I have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say but I will endeavor a little to illustrate my	104.60784149169922
18590/28840	He invited me to dine with him on Saturday which was a very natural thing for him to	46.064273834228516
18591/28840	Well what have I learned since That your mother and	169.3158416748047
18592/28840	de Villefort are both coming to this	108.4738540649414
18593/28840	I shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview This may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless I perceive some hidden plot in the arrangementsomething in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the	147.42098999023438
18594/28840	I believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet	96.53118896484375
18595/28840	and Madame de Villefort and sometimes I confess I have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our	33.37910461425781
18596/28840	My good friend said Valentine I should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if I were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to	68.42909240722656
18597/28840	Is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting Pray reflect a	108.98573303222656
18598/28840	I feel the same as regards	193.85940551757812
18599/28840	said Valentine and I own that if you have no stronger proof to give me   I have another replied Maximilian but I fear you will deem it even more absurd than the	42.69429397583008
18600/28840	So much the worse said Valentine	86.30439758300781
18601/28840	It is nevertheless conclusive to my	102.67414855957031
18602/28840	Dear Maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety When you are away I no longer pray for myself but for	114.60537719726562
18603/28840	30159m       Yes since you have known me said Morrel smiling but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance	48.14823532104492
18604/28840	You are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be	75.64373016357422
18605/28840	Well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which I rode	112.8449935913086
18606/28840	Ah what a beautiful creature cried Valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that I could talk to him and pat him   He is as you see a very valuable animal said Maximil	49.09401321411133
18607/28840	You know that my means are limited and that I am what would be designated a man of moderate pret	102.06884765625
18608/28840	Well I went to a horse dealers where I saw this magnificent horse which I have named Médé	67.56602478027344
18609/28840	I asked the price they told me it was 4500 franc	46.80844497680664
18610/28840	The same evening some friends of mine visited me	1178.791015625
18611/28840	Debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by	109.29470825195312
18612/28840	I never play for I am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to	90.03653717041016
18613/28840	But I was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which I	49.62190246582031
18614/28840	Just as they were sitting down to table	64.18101501464844
18615/28840	He took his seat amongst them they played and I	177.00534057617188
18616/28840	I am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5000 franc	71.10799407958984
18617/28840	I could not defer my pleasure so I took a cabriolet and drove to the horse	47.58799743652344
18618/28840	Feverish and excited I rang at the	396.09295654296875
18619/28840	The person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for I rushed at once to the	68.76502227783203
18620/28840	Médéah was standing at the rack eating his	137.28492736816406
18621/28840	As I rode by the counts house I perceived a light in one of the windows and fancied I saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the	74.13107299804688
18622/28840	Now Valentine I firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring	102.40624237060547
18623/28840	My dear Maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me	56.64775466918945
18624/28840	A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common everyday sort of attachment such as	189.46900939941406
18625/28840	Do you hear   Ah Valentine said Maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that I may have the happiness of kissing	62.380699157714844
18626/28840	Maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two	133.78749084472656
18627/28840	Shall you be happy if I do what you wish   Oh yes   Valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the	50.947998046875
18628/28840	Maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned	87.88368225097656
18629/28840	The little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw Valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own	86.17337799072266
18630/28840	de Villefort entered his fathers room followed by Madame de Ville	16.310508728027344
18631/28840	Both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to Barrois a faithful servant who had been twentyfive years in his service took their places on either side of the paraly	37.20237350463867
18632/28840	Noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at	55.97727584838867
18633/28840	He was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around	75.57374572753906
18634/28840	Noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the newcomers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official	116.85272216796875
18635/28840	He commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were	300.7360534667969
18636/28840	Three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were Villefort Valentine and the old servant of whom we have already	74.93173217773438
18637/28840	But as Villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old mans happiness was centred in his	88.51030731201172
18638/28840	Valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in Noirtiers look all the varied feelings which were passing in his	68.48896789550781
18639/28840	Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to	69.26692199707031
18640/28840	As we have said he perfectly understood the old mans vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so	48.156044006347656
18641/28840	Madame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to	40.195369720458984
18642/28840	Noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary Villeforts eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old mans	69.82877349853516
18643/28840	This communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approb	123.36158752441406
18644/28840	The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing	86.61371612548828
18645/28840	Sir resumed Villefort we are thinking of marrying	50.48591232299805
18646/28840	Had the old mans face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced	139.93890380859375
18647/28840	The marriage will take place in less than three months said Ville	32.0722541809082
18648/28840	Noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate	202.52821350097656
18649/28840	It is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed he possesses fortune a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render Valentine supremely happyhis name moreover cannot be wholly unknown to	157.00120544433594
18650/28840	While his wife was speaking Villefort had narrowly watched the old mans count	51.9280891418457

18652/28840	Noirtiers eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at Madame de Villefort and his	39.60108947753906
18653/28840	The procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between	228.9043731689453
18654/28840	Noirtier and the elder dÉpinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his	100.77652740478516
18655/28840	Sir said he you are aware that Valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable	69.99571990966797
18656/28840	Villefort quietly opened a window saying It is very warm and the heat affects	121.77545928955078
18657/28840	He then returned to his place but did not sit	46.64452362060547
18658/28840	This marriage added Madame de Villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of	42.742061614990234
18659/28840	That assassination was a mysterious affair said Villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one	151.66680908203125
18660/28840	Noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a	77.47974395751953
18661/28840	Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered	90.5861587524414
18662/28840	Yes I understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound	201.26763916015625
18663/28840	Villefort fully understood his fathers meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his	98.43054962158203
18664/28840	He then motioned to his wife to take	67.58844757080078
18665/28840	Now sir said Madame de Villefort I must bid you	26.043054580688477
18666/28840	If he wanted Valentine he closed his right eye only and if Barrois the	125.72151184082031
18667/28840	At Madame de Villeforts proposition he instantly winked his	32.51136016845703
18668/28840	Provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said Then shall I send Valentine to you The old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his	182.63967895507812
18669/28840	and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that Valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the	72.65011596679688
18670/28840	Valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted	121.67662048339844
18671/28840	One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to	55.59668731689453
18672/28840	Dear grandpapa cried she what has happened They have vexed you and you are angry   The paralytic closed his eyes in token of ass	40.044288635253906
18673/28840	Who has displeased you Is it my father  	29.052135467529297
18674/28840	Are you displeased with me cried Valentine in aston	43.81300735473633
18675/28840	And what have I done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried	35.53883361816406
18676/28840	There was no answer and she continued   I have not seen you all	50.45499801635742
18677/28840	Has anyone been speaking to you against me   Yes said the old mans look with eager	52.11933517456055
18678/28840	and Madame de Villefort have just left this room have they not  	25.04053497314453
18679/28840	And it was they who told you something which made you angry What was it then May I go and ask them that I may have the opportunity of making my peace with you   No no said Noirtiers	66.3354263305664
18680/28840	What can they have said and she again tried to think what it could	92.08185577392578
18681/28840	Ah I know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old	67.05581665039062
18682/28840	They have been speaking of my marriagehave they not   Yes replied the angry	82.02619934082031
18683/28840	I understand you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on the	43.45842742919922
18684/28840	The reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of	73.06684112548828
18685/28840	They did not even acquaint me with their intentions and I only discovered them by chance that is why I have been so reserved with you dear grandp	53.43670654296875
18686/28840	But there was no look calculated to reassure her all it seemed to say was It is not only your reserve which afflicts	156.6601104736328
18687/28840	What is it then asked the young	20.60085678100586
18688/28840	Perhaps you think I shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that I shall forget you when I am married  	27.441999435424805
18689/28840	dÉpinay consented to our all living together  	82.41748046875
18690/28840	Then why are you still vexed and grieved The old mans eyes beamed with an expression of gentle	70.21742248535156
18691/28840	Yes I understand said Valentine it is because you love	46.19471740722656
18692/28840	And you are afraid I shall be unhappy  	28.588947296142578
18693/28840	Franz The eyes repeated several times No no	350.3603210449219
18694/28840	Then you are vexed with the engagement  	34.349788665771484
18695/28840	Well listen said Valentine throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm round her grandfathers neck I am vexed too for I do not love	74.0703353881836
18696/28840	An expression of intense joy illumined the old mans	39.916526794433594
18697/28840	When I wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me A tear trembled in the eye of the	92.3416748046875
18698/28840	Well continued Valentine the reason of my proposing it was that I might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to	108.99144744873047
18699/28840	Alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in	78.88092803955078
18700/28840	However this is much and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and	185.9075927734375
18701/28840	At these words there appeared in Noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there You are mistaken I can still do much for	55.51869583129883
18702/28840	Do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said	19.557723999023438
18703/28840	Noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and Valentine when he wanted	83.22850036621094
18704/28840	She then recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to	221.19244384765625
18705/28840	When she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he	82.57888793945312
18706/28840	Ah said Valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter N it is with N that we have to do	150.30322265625
18707/28840	Well let me see what can you want that begins with N NaNeNiNo   Yes yes yes said the old mans	47.07979202270508
18708/28840	Ah it is No then  	39.69005584716797
18709/28840	Valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before Noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old mans eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the	82.37076568603516
18710/28840	At the word _Notary_ Noirtier made a sign to her to	44.60918045043945
18711/28840	30169m       Notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa The old man again signified that it was a notary he	35.336692810058594
18712/28840	You would wish a notary to be sent for then said	59.507957458496094
18713/28840	Shall my father be informed of your wish  	63.663124084472656
18714/28840	Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately  	35.49284744262695
18715/28840	Then they shall go for him directly dear grandp	65.98361206054688
18716/28840	Is that all you want  	35.61381530761719
18717/28840	Valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to	36.237037658691406
18718/28840	I am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover	28.146509170532227
18719/28840	And the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a	32.28078842163086
18720/28840	What do you want me for sir demanded he of the paraly	68.03260040283203
18721/28840	Sir said Valentine my grandfather wishes for a not	75.38849639892578
18722/28840	At this strange and unexpected demand	576.5199584960938
18723/28840	de Villefort and his father exchanged	45.56398391723633
18724/28840	Yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of Valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the	74.26264953613281
18725/28840	Do you wish for a notary asked Ville	27.01661491394043
18726/28840	What to do   Noirtier made no	14.720659255981445
18727/28840	What do you want with a notary again repeated Ville	49.428123474121094
18728/28840	The invalids eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalter	317.79150390625
18729/28840	Is it to do us some ill turn Do you think it is worth while said Ville	66.48353576660156
18730/28840	Still said Barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant if	57.10337448120117
18731/28840	Noirtier asks for a notary I suppose he really wishes for a notary therefore I shall go at once and fetch	68.1293716430664
18732/28840	Barrois acknowledged no master but Noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be	135.8565673828125
18733/28840	30171m       Yes I do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and I should like to see the person who dares to refuse my	43.98700714111328
18734/28840	You shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said Villefort but I shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous	78.01604461669922
18735/28840	Never mind that said Barrois I shall go and fetch a notary	57.593631744384766
18736/28840	And the old servant departed triumphantly on his	130.86634826660156
18737/28840	The Will   As soon as Barrois had left the room Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious expression that said many	37.40047073364258
18738/28840	The young girl perfectly understood the look and so did Villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows	102.95176696777344
18739/28840	He took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the not	57.582672119140625
18740/28840	Noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at Valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the	58.196327209472656
18741/28840	Threequarters of an hour after Barrois returned bringing the notary with	53.493995666503906
18742/28840	Sir said Villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by	38.13422393798828
18743/28840	All his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his	193.78492736816406
18744/28840	Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered	127.7381820678711
18745/28840	Sir said she I perfectly understand my grandfathers meaning at all	122.55827331542969
18746/28840	That is quite true said Barrois and that is what I told the gentleman as we walked	65.4669418334961
18747/28840	Permit me said the notary turning first to Villefort and then to Valentinepermit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous	121.48118591308594
18748/28840	The first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the	120.94464111328125
18749/28840	An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procure	36.717498779296875
18750/28840	Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the not	54.16356658935547
18751/28840	Sir said she the language which I speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and I can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as I can	43.23808670043945
18752/28840	Will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject   In order to render an act valid I must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my	36.99488830566406
18753/28840	Illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely	238.6392822265625
18754/28840	Well sir by the help of two signs with which I will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental	113.76899719238281
18755/28840	Noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means	151.01638793945312
18756/28840	You now know quite enough to enable you to converse with	75.78268432617188
18757/28840	Noirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary	56.27240753173828
18758/28840	You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the not	83.01786804199219
18759/28840	And you approve of what she saidthat is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts  	68.80924224853516
18760/28840	It was you who sent for me  	25.85706901550293
18761/28840	To make your will  	126.63001251220703
18762/28840	And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions The old man winked	84.67499542236328
18763/28840	Well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject   But before the notary could answer Villefort had drawn him	56.77271270751953
18764/28840	Sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as	57.90021514892578
18765/28840	Noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties   It is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his	54.727195739746094
18766/28840	You must see that to be an utter impossibility said Ville	36.73134231567383
18767/28840	Valentine and the old man heard this conversation and Noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the	54.09270095825195
18768/28840	Sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to	191.05184936523438
18769/28840	I can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the	81.34976196289062
18770/28840	I have now been six years with	106.19231414794922
18771/28840	Noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me	59.62466812133789
18772/28840	Let us try what we can do then said the not	57.518951416015625
18773/28840	You accept this young lady as your interpreter	174.00381469726562
18774/28840	Well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up   Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to	61.44242858886719
18775/28840	At this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was to	59.72688293457031
18776/28840	It is very evident that it is the letter W which	61.175960540771484
18777/28840	Wait said Valentine and turning to her grandfather she repeated WaWeWi The old man stopped her at the last syll	68.5469970703125
18778/28840	Valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the	49.538185119628906
18779/28840	She passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word Will	196.19378662109375
18780/28840	Will said the notary it is very evident that	27.936494827270508
18781/28840	Noirtier is desirous of making his	39.21107864379883
18782/28840	Really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to	79.93399810791016
18783/28840	No no no replied the eye of the paraly	51.29930114746094
18784/28840	What said Villefort do you mean to say that Valentine is not interested in your will  	24.432361602783203
18785/28840	As to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of	74.38343048095703
18786/28840	There are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the	186.68212890625
18787/28840	As to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the	109.2138442993164
18788/28840	But besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the	91.13483428955078
18789/28840	Are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old	58.75305938720703
18790/28840	30175m       Yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his	48.81142044067383
18791/28840	What is he going to do thought Villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his fathers intentions	117.0706787109375
18792/28840	He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but Barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masters wishes and had already gone to fetch	63.77529525756836
18793/28840	The procureur then told his wife to come	166.95492553710938
18794/28840	In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic the second notary had also	30.993457794189453
18795/28840	A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the	66.55965423583984
18796/28840	Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune  	41.42190933227539
18797/28840	I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation you will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions  	84.22945404052734
18798/28840	There was a kind of solemnity in this	36.6306266784668
18799/28840	Never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious	126.64474487304688
18800/28840	They had formed a circle round the invalid the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have	76.08898162841797
18801/28840	Your fortune exceeds 300000 francs does it not asked	92.98677825927734
18802/28840	Noirtier made a sign that it	22.814332962036133
18803/28840	Do you possess 400000 francs inquired the not	60.7854118347168
18804/28840	600000700000800000900000   Noirtier stopped him at the lastnamed	71.98469543457031
18805/28840	You are then in possession of 900000 francs asked the not	28.19745635986328
18806/28840	The stock is in your own hands   The look which	108.39246368408203
18807/28840	Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to	40.378990173339844
18808/28840	The old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small c	91.74188995361328
18809/28840	Do you permit us to open this casket asked the not	76.29545593261719
18810/28840	They opened it and found 900000 francs in bank sc	85.9884262084961
18811/28840	The first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his	173.2909698486328
18812/28840	The total amount was found to be as	752.88134765625
18813/28840	It is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vig	81.94499969482422
18814/28840	Then turning towards the paralytic he said You possess then 900000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40000 livres  	44.8382682800293
18815/28840	To whom do you desire to leave this fortune   Oh said Madame de Villefort there is not much doubt on that	26.132505416870117
18816/28840	The eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by Madame de Villeforts words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to	73.4207763671875
18817/28840	Valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eyes were cast down and she was	127.50438690185547
18818/28840	The old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of	42.70296859741211
18819/28840	What said the notary do you not intend making Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee  	45.37325668334961
18820/28840	You are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declare that such is not your intention   No repeated Noirtier	58.1916389465332
18821/28840	Valentine raised her head struck dumb with aston	95.55020904541016
18822/28840	It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an	57.57651901245117
18823/28840	But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed   Oh grandpapa I see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which I have always	33.80043029785156
18824/28840	Ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not	66.29014587402344
18825/28840	The old mans declaration that Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said   Then doubtless dear	85.05753326416016
18826/28840	Noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson Edward de Villefort   The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to	110.04896545410156
18827/28840	No said the notary then perhaps it is to your son	62.2578239440918
18828/28840	The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the test	77.66532135009766
18829/28840	Villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from	195.37026977539062
18830/28840	What have we all done then dear grandpapa said Valentine you no longer seem to love any of us   The old mans eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife and rested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fond	35.1687126159668
18831/28840	Well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present	92.36726379394531
18832/28840	You know me well enough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune besides they say I am already rich in right of my mothertoo rich	66.606201171875
18833/28840	Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentines	81.9477767944336
18834/28840	Oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my fathers mind is really impaired said Ville	47.2963752746582
18835/28840	It is my marriage you mean is it not dear grandpapa   Yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on Valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his	52.65956497192383
18836/28840	30179m       You are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not   Yes   Really this is too absurd said Ville	20.12042999267578
18837/28840	Excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of	55.87025833129883
18838/28840	Noirtier is quite evident to me and I can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his	75.28977966308594
18839/28840	You do not wish me to marry	26.813005447387695
18840/28840	I do not wish it said the eye of her	36.124542236328125
18841/28840	And you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes  	79.90496063232422
18842/28840	So that but for this marriage she would have been your heir  	61.35808181762695
18843/28840	The two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the	179.73052978515625
18844/28840	But said Villefort who was the first to break the silence I consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in	37.13478088378906
18845/28840	I am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughters	80.53396606445312
18846/28840	It is my wish that she should marry	130.7672882080078
18847/28840	Sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying	38.02045440673828
18848/28840	Franz The old man gave no	216.3333740234375
18849/28840	You will of course dispose of it in some way or other  	41.112892150878906
18850/28840	In favor of some member of your family  	52.42263412475586
18851/28840	Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the not	139.3788604736328
18852/28840	But said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony  	41.20664596557617
18853/28840	You only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son Noirtier made no	86.69449615478516
18854/28840	Do you still wish to dispose of all  	40.40013122558594
18855/28840	But they will contest the will after your death  	121.52545166015625
18856/28840	My father knows me replied Villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position I cannot plead against the	92.00171661376953
18857/28840	The eye of Noirtier beamed with	117.48584747314453
18858/28840	What do you decide on sir asked the notary of Ville	47.86769485473633
18859/28840	Nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know he never alters his	78.93206024169922
18860/28840	These 900000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and I shall therefore act according to my	49.765438079833984
18861/28840	Having said this Villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he	41.7859992980957
18862/28840	The same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to	123.40118408203125
18863/28840	and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte Cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawingroom and was still awaiting them	24.198150634765625
18864/28840	Madame de Villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the	82.72380065917969
18865/28840	_Ma foi_ said Monte Cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you	40.887271881103516
18866/28840	de Villefort Have I arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime   Villefort tried to	44.403953552246094
18867/28840	No count he replied I am the only victim in this	100.72032165527344
18868/28840	It is I who lose my cause and it is illluck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against	83.70849609375
18869/28840	To what do you refer said Monte Cristo with wellfeigned	27.757587432861328
18870/28840	Have you really met with some great misfortune   Oh no monsieur said Villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which I have sustainednothing worth mentioning I assure	34.849246978759766
18871/28840	True said Monte Cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic	83.91803741455078
18872/28840	30183m       What do you say said the count 900000 francs It is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a	30.755016326904297
18873/28840	And who is the cause of all this annoyance   My father as I told	27.93267250061035
18874/28840	Noirtier But I thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed   Yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner I have	113.83411407470703
18875/28840	I left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two not	136.7083740234375
18876/28840	But to do this he must have spoken   He has done better than thathe has made himself	75.80072784423828
18877/28840	How was such a thing possible   By the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal	83.71249389648438
18878/28840	My dear said Madame de Villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the	30.585725784301758
18879/28840	Madame de Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious	45.254756927490234
18880/28840	de Villefort has been telling me demanded Monte Cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune   Incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his	50.41709518432617
18881/28840	and Madame de Villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching Edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the birds water	98.68620300292969
18882/28840	My dear said Villefort in answer to his wife you know I have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have I ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my	64.7348403930664
18883/28840	Nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which I have entertained for so many	48.478431701660156
18884/28840	The Baron dÉpinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be	54.99274444580078
18885/28840	Do you think said Madame de Villefort that Valentine is in league with him She has always been opposed to this marriage and I should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between	51.34909439086914
18886/28840	Madame said Villefort believe me a fortune of 900000 francs is not so easily ren	36.431514739990234
18887/28840	She could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a	168.2422332763672
18888/28840	Never mind replied Villefort I say that this marriage _shall_ be consumm	68.72968292236328
18889/28840	Notwithstanding your fathers wishes to the contrary said Madame de Villefort selecting a new point of	118.50072479248047
18890/28840	Monte Cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was	305.205810546875
18891/28840	30185m       Madame replied Villefort I can truly say that I have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral	57.58772659301758
18892/28840	The name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to	130.20220947265625
18893/28840	But under the present circumstances I am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the	79.19113159179688
18894/28840	It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such cap	107.0196762084961
18895/28840	I shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward	231.30694580078125
18896/28840	Noirtier I will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but I shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his	103.06434631347656
18897/28840	Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz dÉpinay because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because I choose to bestow my daughters hand on whomever I	88.1973648071289
18898/28840	What said the count the approbation of whose eye Villefort had frequently solicited during this	49.0245246887207
18899/28840	Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry	13.448664665222168
18900/28840	le Baron Franz dÉpinay   Yes sir that is the reason said Villefort shrugging his	10.735824584960938
18901/28840	The apparent reason at least said Madame de Ville	41.32280731201172
18902/28840	The _real_ reason madame I can assure you I know my	66.5895004272461
18903/28840	But I want to know in what way	70.69623565673828
18904/28840	dÉpinay can have displeased your father more than any other person   I believe I know	45.5746955871582
18905/28840	Franz dÉpinay said the count is he not the son of General de Quesnel who was created Baron dÉpinay by Charles	30.1391544342041
18906/28840	Well but he is a charming young man according to my	38.82756042480469
18907/28840	He is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of	51.12054443359375
18908/28840	Noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying old men are always so selfish in their affection said Madame de Ville	71.06009674072266
18909/28840	Was not your father a Bonapartist asked Monte Cristo I think I remember that you told me something of that	30.25506591796875
18910/28840	My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else said Villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which Napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing	97.47049713134766
18911/28840	When my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the Bourbons for	68.1063461303711
18912/28840	Well said Monte Cristo it is just as I thought it was politics which brought Noirtier and	34.008853912353516
18913/28840	Am I mistaken then said Monte Crist	38.0389404296875
18914/28840	No sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said Madame de Villefort and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that	60.71985626220703
18915/28840	de Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate	134.4001007080078
18916/28840	It was a sublime and charitable thought said Monte Cristo and the whole world should applaud	74.79832458496094
18917/28840	It would be noble to see Mademoiselle Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz dÉpin	18.701078414916992
18918/28840	Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just	29.72220230102539
18919/28840	But the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the nevervarying smile he was so constantly in the habit of	191.87672424316406
18920/28840	Although said Villefort it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose her grandfathers fortune I do not think that	36.56409454345703
18921/28840	dÉpinay will be frightened at this pecuniary	97.95903778076172
18922/28840	He will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that I sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with	117.63153076171875
18923/28840	Besides he knows that Valentine is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all probability inherit the fortune of	70.14215850830078
18924/28840	and Madame de SaintMéran her mothers parents who both love her tender	64.47969818115234
18925/28840	And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as	187.53114318847656
18926/28840	Noirtier said Madame de Villefort besides they are to come to Paris in about a month and Valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with	70.60621643066406
18927/28840	The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded selflove and defeated	388.7703552246094
18928/28840	But it seems to me said Monte Cristo and I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am about to say that if	21.744123458862305
18929/28840	Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear	33.41835403442383
18930/28840	True said Madame de Villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjustshamefully unjust Poor Edward is as much	91.20878601074219
18931/28840	Noirtiers grandchild as Valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry	62.429683685302734
18932/28840	Noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than	56.028892517089844
18933/28840	The count listened and said no	329.4518127441406
18934/28840	Count said Villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortun	28.66900634765625
18935/28840	It is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and	64.05984497070312
18936/28840	dÉpinay to whom I had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if I endure the most cruel priv	79.69119262695312
18937/28840	However said Madame de Villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to	52.20631408691406
18938/28840	dÉpinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de Ville	23.669960021972656
18939/28840	Ah that would be a great pity said Ville	24.308067321777344
18940/28840	Undoubtedly said Villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which I was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain	138.4551239013672
18941/28840	No it will all go well	578.7929077148438
18942/28840	dÉpinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is	47.328025817871094
18943/28840	de Villefort said Monte Cristo fixing his eyes on Madame de Villefort and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice I would persuade him since I have been told	33.586769104003906
18944/28840	dÉpinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of	118.11918640136719
18945/28840	I will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on	81.42536163330078
18946/28840	The procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed	504.41900634765625
18947/28840	Well that is all that I wanted and I will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to Monte Crist	41.554325103759766
18948/28840	Therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original	117.05398559570312
18949/28840	Sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and	77.50405883789062
18950/28840	dÉpinay even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a	48.69704818725586
18951/28840	At the conclusion of these words the count rose to	90.92413330078125
18952/28840	Are you going to leave us count said Madame de Ville	15.129390716552734
18953/28840	I am sorry to say I must do so madame I only came to remind you of your promise for	45.81257247924805
18954/28840	Did you fear that we should forget it   You are very good madame but	39.94470977783203
18955/28840	de Villefort has so many important and urgent	66.39219665527344
18956/28840	My husband has given me his word sir said Madame de Villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to	51.82146453857422
18957/28840	And said Villefort is it at your house in the ChampsÉlysées that you receive your visitors   No said Monte Cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritoriousit is in the	28.922481536865234
18958/28840	Where is it then Near Paris is it not   Very near only half a league from the Barriersit is at Auteu	74.79364776611328
18959/28840	At Auteuil said Villefort true Madame de Villefort told me you lived at Auteuil since it was to your house that she was	24.151687622070312
18960/28840	And in what part of Auteuil do you reside   Rue de la Font	26.63062858581543
18961/28840	Rue de la Fontaine exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone at what number  	42.664459228515625
18962/28840	Then cried Villefort was it you who bought	101.96124267578125
18963/28840	de SaintMérans house   Did it belong to	36.31789779663086
18964/28840	Yes replied Madame de Villefort and would you believe it count   Believe what   You think this house pretty do you not   I think it	38.7277946472168
18965/28840	Well my husband would never live in	135.97581481933594
18966/28840	Indeed returned Monte Cristo that is a prejudice on your part	45.72770309448242
18967/28840	de Villefort for which I am quite at a loss to	50.425941467285156
18968/28840	I do not like Auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear	46.83012008666992
18969/28840	But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said Monte Crist	31.0911808013916
18970/28840	No countI hopeI assure you I shall do my best stammered Ville	44.914039611816406
18971/28840	Oh said Monte Cristo I allow of no	47.58620071411133
18972/28840	I shall be expecting you and if you fail to come I shall thinkfor how do I know to the contrarythat this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with	88.38909149169922
18973/28840	I will come countI will be sure to come said Villefort	61.58612823486328
18974/28840	Thank you said Monte Cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of	28.690523147583008
18975/28840	You said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said Madame de Villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other	30.886629104614258
18976/28840	Indeed madame said Monte Cristo I scarcely know if I dare tell you where I am	23.358386993408203
18977/28840	Well then it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for hours	175.0591583251953
18978/28840	What is it   A te	16.10492706298828
18979/28840	So now I have told my	108.46542358398438
18980/28840	I began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own	124.63023376464844
18981/28840	Now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrig	184.2032470703125
18982/28840	At length I felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insectactors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of	282.5894775390625
18983/28840	30191m       And are you going there   I	11.92622184753418
18984/28840	_Ma foi_ I should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I had formed of my fellowcreat	73.73847198486328
18985/28840	I shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where I shall find a goodnatured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to	77.42379760742188
18986/28840	You are a singular man said Ville	26.026426315307617
18987/28840	What line would you advise me to study   The one that is most in use just at this	100.9832763671875
18988/28840	The Spanish one you mean I suppose   Yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you   No said Monte Cristo since as I told you before I do not wish to comprehend	35.109161376953125
18989/28840	The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me it will be nothing more than a sign from	56.41337203979492
18990/28840	Montalivet transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne mystified by two Greek words _têle_ _graphein	192.49594116210938
18991/28840	It is the insect with black claws and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its	114.46600341796875
18992/28840	Go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see	37.98429870605469
18993/28840	Which is the nearest way Bayonne   Yes the road to Bay	109.25765991210938
18994/28840	And afterwards the road to Châtillon  	99.42365264892578
18995/28840	By the tower of Montlhéry you mean  	45.45033264160156
18996/28840	On Saturday I will tell you my impressions concerning the te	69.582275390625
18997/28840	At the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit Valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their	81.82926940917969
18998/28840	Leaving the village of Linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of Montlhéry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that	111.12044525146484
18999/28840	At the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white	106.65222930908203
19000/28840	Monte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and	163.7130889892578
19001/28840	The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of Delacroix our modern Rub	152.37945556640625
19002/28840	This path was formed in the shape of the figure of 8 thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only	205.0052947998047
19003/28840	Never had Flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little	238.6432647705078
19004/28840	In fact of the twenty rosetrees which formed the _parterre_ not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp	132.65908813476562
19005/28840	Monte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look	123.7581558227539
19006/28840	The man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to	111.01140594482422
19007/28840	Suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape	111.03056335449219
19008/28840	He had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his	228.1820831298828
19009/28840	You are gathering your crop sir said Monte Cristo	49.060935974121094
19010/28840	30193m       Excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap I am not up there I know but I have only just come	29.496633529663086
19011/28840	Do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any	113.47068786621094
19012/28840	I have ten left said the man for here are eleven and I had twentyone five more than last	177.90243530273438
19013/28840	But I am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat	265.3666076660156
19014/28840	This is the reason that instead of the sixteen I had last year I have this year you see eleven already pluckedtwelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen	229.85902404785156
19015/28840	Ah I miss three they were here last night sirI am sure they were hereI counted	185.7106475830078
19016/28840	It must be the son of Mère Simon who has stolen them I saw him strolling about here this	97.41813659667969
19017/28840	Ah the young rascalstealing in a gardenhe does not know where that may lead him	55.087276458740234
19018/28840	Certainly it is wrong said Monte Cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the	69.96945190429688
19019/28840	Of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less	90.34187316894531
19020/28840	But sir once more I beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that I am detaining	152.93319702148438
19021/28840	And he glanced timidly at the counts blue	77.03211975097656
19022/28840	Ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy	59.606903076171875
19023/28840	What Did the Romans eat them said the gardenerate dormice   I have read so in Petronius said the	119.51946258544922
19024/28840	Really They cant be nice though they do say as fat as a dorm	342.0265808105469
19025/28840	It is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all	203.83714294433594
19026/28840	Last year I had four apricotsthey stole one I had one nectarine only onewell sir they ate half of it on the wall a splendid nectarineI never ate a	195.72535705566406
19027/28840	You ate it   That is to say the half that was leftyou understand it was exquisite	113.83323669433594
19028/28840	Ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like Mère Simons son who has not chosen the worst	216.45326232910156
19029/28840	But this year continued the horticulturist Ill take care it shall not happen even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are	135.50726318359375
19030/28840	Every man has a devouring passion in his heart as every fruit has its worm that of the telegraph man was hort	136.7789306640625
19031/28840	He began gathering the grapeleaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gard	132.7222900390625
19032/28840	Did you come here sir to see the telegraph he	65.3442153930664
19033/28840	Yes if it isnt contrary to the	124.97396850585938
19034/28840	Oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are	66.80955505371094
19035/28840	I have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you	95.97917175292969
19036/28840	That is true sir and that is what I like best said the man	95.28453826904297
19037/28840	Why do you like that best   Because then I have no	70.13299560546875
19038/28840	I am a machine then and nothing else and so long as I work nothing more is required of	114.26062774658203
19039/28840	Is it possible said Monte Cristo to himself that I can have met with a man that has no ambition That would spoil my	74.36388397216797
19040/28840	Sir said the gardener glancing at the sundial the ten minutes are almost up I must return to my	67.1389389038086
19041/28840	Will you go up with me   I follow	40.262020111083984
19042/28840	Monte Cristo entered the tower which was divided into three	267.709228515625
19043/28840	The tower contained implements such as spades rakes wateringpots hung against the wall this was all the	371.8543701171875
19044/28840	Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing asked Monte Crist	99.8949203491211
19045/28840	The study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so	73.19851684570312
19046/28840	And what is the pay   A thousand francs	43.31391143798828
19047/28840	No but then we are lodged as you	126.22561645507812
19048/28840	They passed to the third story it was the telegraph	113.11888122558594
19049/28840	Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was	249.41241455078125
19050/28840	It is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a	47.24714660644531
19051/28840	At first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year I became used to it and then we have our hours of recreation and our	85.79920196533203
19052/28840	When   When we have a	55.759437561035156
19053/28840	Those are indeed holidays to me I go into the garden I plant I prune I trim I kill the insects all day	243.20172119140625
19054/28840	How long have you been here   Ten years and five as a supernumerary make	81.54943084716797
19055/28840	You are   Fiftyfive years	58.39213180541992
19056/28840	How long must you have served to claim the pension   Oh sir twentyfive	115.47344970703125
19057/28840	And how much is the pension   A hundred crown	41.11045837402344
19058/28840	What did you say sir asked the	30.941856384277344
19059/28840	I was saying it was very	108.90957641601562
19060/28840	What was   All you were showing	101.44752502441406
19061/28840	And you really understand none of these signals   None at	121.11332702636719
19062/28840	And have you never tried to understand them  	68.25875854492188
19063/28840	Why should I   But still there are some signals only addressed to	135.4332275390625
19064/28840	And do you understand them   They are always the	38.456146240234375
19065/28840	And they mean   _Nothing new You have an hour_ or _Tomorrow	117.00979614257812
19066/28840	This is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion   Ah yes thank you	83.413330078125
19067/28840	And what is it sayinganything you understand   Yes it asks if I am	49.72554397583008
19068/28840	And you reply   By the same sign which at the same time tells my righthand correspondent that I am ready while it gives notice to my lefthand correspondent to prepare in his	68.41183471679688
19069/28840	It is very ingenious said the	27.437740325927734
19070/28840	You will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will	96.27262115478516
19071/28840	I have then five minutes said Monte Cristo to himself it is more time than I	37.74653625488281
19072/28840	My dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question   What is it sir   You are fond of gardening   Passion	25.275789260864258
19073/28840	And you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres   Sir I should make a terrestrial paradise of	69.82760620117188
19074/28840	You live badly on your thousand francs   Badly enough but yet I do	168.1199493408203
19075/28840	Yes but you have a wretchedly small	186.4399871826172
19076/28840	And then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat	95.11870574951172
19077/28840	Tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your righthand correspondent was telegraphing   I should not see	49.009342193603516
19078/28840	Then what would happen   I could not repeat the	50.03556442260742
19079/28840	And then   Not having repeated them through negligence I should be	121.90786743164062
19080/28840	How much   A hundred franc	30.01661491394043
19081/28840	The tenth of your incomethat would be fine	506.2597351074219
19082/28840	Has it ever happened to you said Monte Crist	30.48735237121582
19083/28840	Once sir when I was grafting a roset	81.98006439208984
19084/28840	Well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another   Ah that is another case I should be turned off and lose my	134.75787353515625
19085/28840	Three hundred francs   A hundred crowns yes sir so you see that I am not likely to do any of these	33.24371337890625
19086/28840	Not even for fifteen years wages Come it is worth thinking about   For fifteen thousand francs  	53.0779914855957
19087/28840	Sir you are tempting me   Just so fifteen thousand francs do you understand   Sir let me see my righthand	25.4207706451416
19088/28840	On the contrary do not look at him but at	56.33085250854492
19089/28840	What is it   What Do you not know these bits of paper   Banknotes   Exactly there are fifteen of	51.08344268798828
19090/28840	And whose are they   Yours if you	152.52252197265625
19091/28840	Sir you have distracted me I shall be	55.889923095703125
19092/28840	That will cost you a hundred francs you see it is your interest to take my bank	59.70472717285156
19093/28840	Sir my righthand correspondent redoubles his signals he is	55.87015151977539
19094/28840	Never mindtake these and the count placed the packet in the mans	170.4601593017578
19095/28840	Now this is not all he said you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand franc	38.61880111694336
19096/28840	No you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondents	80.78611755371094
19097/28840	Oh sir what are you proposing   A j	33.649776458740234
19098/28840	Sir unless you force me   I think I can effectually force you and Monte Cristo drew another packet from his	54.35662078857422

19113/28840	Five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister Debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to Danglars	51.39996337890625
19114/28840	Has your husband any Spanish bonds he asked of the baron	85.89888000488281

19123/28840	The same evening the following was read in _Le Messager_   By te	71.37452697753906
19124/28840	The king Don Carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at Bourges and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian	104.81275177001953
19125/28840	All that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stockjobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a	43.847442626953125
19126/28840	Those who had kept their shares or bought those of Danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad	64.77748107910156
19127/28840	Next morning _Le Moniteur_ contained the following   It was without any foundation that _Le Messager_ yesterday announced the flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of	120.03377532958984

19133/28840	Indeed almost before the door opened the scene	154.59747314453125
19134/28840	Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was	95.9660415649414
19135/28840	It is told that the Duc dAntin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed Louis	106.11836242675781
19136/28840	For the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to Bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving	71.37261199951172
19137/28840	Thus the house had become unrecognizable and Bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of	63.242645263671875
19138/28840	The overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be	98.40746307373047
19139/28840	Bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantlepieces with	192.43556213378906
19140/28840	One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertucc	85.8233871459961
19141/28840	Before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and Bertuccio with	74.53873443603516
19142/28840	At five oclock precisely the count arrived before the house at Auteuil followed by	25.557043075561523
19143/28840	Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frown	74.13754272460938
19144/28840	That can only be to hold gloves he	168.1052703857422

19159/28840	Then they follow you asked Monte Crist	62.50539779663086
19160/28840	And at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before	116.68379211425781
19161/28840	The carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horse	63.16299057006836
19162/28840	The instant Debray had touched the ground he was at the carriaged	34.9055061340332
19163/28840	He offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but Monte Crist	47.55156707763672
19164/28840	But nothing escaped the counts notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of Madame Danglars to that of the ministers	77.36659240722656
19165/28840	After his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his	90.13542175292969

19171/28840	You see my position madame said Morrel bestowing a grateful smile on Monte Crist	85.68411254882812
19172/28840	It seems to me said Danglars in his coarse tone illconcealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses	44.06205749511719
19173/28840	Madame Danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said	66.76455688476562

19176/28840	How soat what period can that have been   I do not know I have only heard that an emperor of China had an oven built expressly and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively	102.84912872314453

19179/28840	Divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the	214.4490203857422

19257/28840	de ChâteauRenaud in pleasing a woman and you Morrel in breaking a horse that no one can	48.65676498413086
19258/28840	For example you see these two fish one brought from fifty leagues beyond	231.2350616455078
19259/28840	Petersburg the other five leagues from	2490.446044921875
19260/28840	Is it not amusing to see them both on the same table   What are the two fish asked Dangl	37.119258880615234
19261/28840	ChâteauRenaud who has lived in Russia will tell you the name of one and Major Cavalcanti who is an Italian will tell you the name of the	29.428756713867188
19262/28840	This one is I think a sterlet said ChâteauRen	22.062707901000977
19263/28840	And that one if I mistake not a lamp	114.3895034790039
19264/28840	Danglars ask these gentlemen where they are	70.16226196289062
19265/28840	Sterlets said ChâteauRenaud are only found in the Vol	40.79951095581055
19266/28840	And said Cavalcanti I know that Lake Fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that	88.30243682861328
19267/28840	Exactly one comes from the Volga and the other from Lake Fus	41.74048614501953
19268/28840	Well this is just what amuses me said Monte Crist	52.09009552001953
19269/28840	I am like Nero_cupitor impossibilium_ and that is what is amusing you at this	120.92082977294922
19270/28840	This fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it	134.0071258544922
19271/28840	But how could you have these fish brought to France   Oh nothing more	66.36263275146484
19272/28840	Danglars   I cannot help doubting answered Danglars with his stupid	22.96320915222168
19273/28840	Baptistin said the count have the other fish brought inthe sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet	158.1125030517578
19274/28840	Danglars opened his bewildered eyes the company clapped their	79.2061996459961
19275/28840	Four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the	109.52848815917969
19276/28840	But why have two of each sort asked Dangl	91.66829681396484
19277/28840	Merely because one might have died carelessly answered Monte Crist	156.3876190185547
19278/28840	You are certainly an extraordinary man said Danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be	49.251319885253906
19279/28840	And to have ideas added Madame Dangl	47.1162109375
19280/28840	It was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the	166.67152404785156
19281/28840	Their agony formed part of their meritif they were not seen alive they were despised when	337.7877502441406
19282/28840	Yes said Debray but then Ostia is only a few leagues from	68.34777069091797
19283/28840	True said Monte Cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after Lucullus if we can do no better than he could   The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say	52.15706253051758
19284/28840	All this is very extraordinary said ChâteauRenaud still what I admire the most I confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are	53.72161102294922
19285/28840	Is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago   Certainly not	71.56575012207031
19286/28840	Well I am sure it is quite transformed since last	154.96290588378906
19287/28840	If I remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years	93.10581970214844
19288/28840	Why not I am fond of grass and shade said Monte Crist	75.58456420898438
19289/28840	Yes said Madame de Villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road I	50.338253021240234
19290/28840	Yes madame said Monte Cristo but I preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my	27.729246139526367
19291/28840	In four days said Morrel it is extraordinary   Indeed said ChâteauRenaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull	47.571388244628906
19292/28840	I recollect coming for my mother to look at it when	92.31873321533203
19293/28840	de SaintMéran advertised it for sale two or three years	34.48684310913086
19294/28840	de SaintMéran said Madame de Villefort then this house belonged to	18.15694808959961
19295/28840	de SaintMéran before you bought it   It appears so replied Monte Crist	20.496721267700195
19296/28840	Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it   Quite so my steward transacts all this business for	43.787208557128906
19297/28840	It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied said ChâteauRenaud and it was quite melancholy to look at it with the blinds closed the doors locked and the weeds in the	52.389408111572266
19298/28840	Really if the house had not belonged to the fatherinlaw of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been	66.3691177368164
19299/28840	Villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it	83.72310638427734
19300/28840	Perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the not	45.542911529541016
19301/28840	It is probable stammered out Villefort trying to smile but I can assure you that I had nothing to do with any such	31.951087951660156
19302/28840	This house is part of Valentines marriageportion and	172.0692901611328
19303/28840	de SaintMéran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to	43.589447021484375
19304/28840	It was Morrels turn to become	159.6728057861328
19305/28840	There was above all one room continued Monte Cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which I know not why appeared to me quite	94.44845581054688
19306/28840	Why so said Danglars why dramatic   Can we account for instinct said Monte Crist	61.10808563232422
19307/28840	Are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadnesswhy we cannot	220.79359436035156
19308/28840	It is a chain of recollectionsan idea which carries you back to other times to other placeswhich very likely have no connection with the present time and	250.38583374023438
19309/28840	And there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges10 or Desdem	45.55929183959961
19310/28840	Stay since we have finished dinner I will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the	51.19792175292969
19311/28840	Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his	93.30955505371094
19312/28840	Madame de Villefort rose Monte Cristo did the same and the rest followed their	49.03693771362305
19313/28840	Villefort and Madame Danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid	50.46736526489258
19314/28840	We must go replied Villefort offering his	81.61778259277344
19315/28840	Each one went out by the open	108.64783477783203
19316/28840	Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to	69.32583618164062
19317/28840	They began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the Eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of	149.65786743164062
19318/28840	The drawingrooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from China of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful	202.90240478515625
19319/28840	At length they arrived at the famous	111.27771759033203
19320/28840	There was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was oldfashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecor	133.81594848632812
19321/28840	These two causes were enough to give it a gloomy	223.6259002685547
19322/28840	cried Madame de Villefort it is really fright	39.30336380004883
19323/28840	Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words but was not	38.638431549072266
19324/28840	Many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the	117.7453384399414
19325/28840	30221m       Is it not so asked Monte Crist	19.416109085083008
19326/28840	Oh said Madame de Villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed   Madame Danglars rose	40.789371490478516
19327/28840	And then said Monte Cristo this is not	19.03002166748047
19328/28840	What is there more said Debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of Madame Dangl	20.276147842407227
19329/28840	Ah what else is there said Danglars for at present I cannot say that I have seen anything	46.57255935668945
19330/28840	Cavalcanti   Ah said he we have at Pisa Ugolinos tower at Ferrara Tassos prison at Rimini the room of Francesca and Pa	250.75718688964844
19331/28840	Yes but you have not this little staircase said Monte Cristo opening a door concealed by the draper	52.99055862426758
19332/28840	Look at it and tell me what you think of	22.470699310302734
19333/28840	What a wickedlooking crooked staircase said ChâteauRenaud with a	28.61009979248047
19334/28840	I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said Debr	95.5773696899414
19335/28840	Ever since Valentines dowry had been mentioned Morrel had been silent and	108.11006164550781
19336/28840	Ah madame cried Debray what is the matter with you how pale you look   It is very evident what is the matter with her said Madame de Villefort	19.787174224853516
19337/28840	de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to	117.3228759765625
19338/28840	Yes said Villefort really count you frighten the	99.15752410888672
19339/28840	What is the matter asked Debray in a whisper of Madame Dangl	10.5706205368042
19340/28840	Nothing she replied with a violent	63.396026611328125
19341/28840	Will you come into the garden said Debray advancing towards the back	41.15034103393555
19342/28840	No no she answered I would rather remain	175.50732421875
19343/28840	Are you really frightened madame said Monte Crist	27.577190399169922
19344/28840	Oh no sir said Madame Danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of	50.60268020629883
19345/28840	30223m       Ah yes said Monte Cristo smiling it is all a matter of	20.514291763305664
19346/28840	Madame Danglars is ill said Villefort it would be better to take her to her	22.702133178710938
19347/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo taking it from her	21.952953338623047
19348/28840	Yes she said at your advice I have made the	56.33536148071289
19349/28840	And have you succeeded   I think	36.56302261352539
19350/28840	Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room Monte Cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips she returned to	43.368812561035156
19351/28840	Ah she cried what a frightful dream   Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a	48.4417839050293
19352/28840	Danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with Major Cavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to	46.27898406982422
19353/28840	He took the arm of Madame Danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found Danglars taking coffee between the Cavalc	22.908878326416016
19354/28840	Really madame he said did I alarm you much   Oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our	100.07865905761719
19355/28840	And then you know he said an idea a supposition is	126.22356414794922
19356/28840	Well said Monte Cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this	24.2716121673584
19357/28840	Take care said Madame de Villefort the kings attorney is	26.15810203552246
19358/28840	Ah replied Monte Cristo since that is the case I will take advantage of his presence to make my	28.95482063293457
19359/28840	Oh this is very interesting said Debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate	48.96712112426758
19360/28840	There has been a crime said Monte Crist	26.106351852416992
19361/28840	Villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent	91.90029907226562
19362/28840	He then took Villeforts arm and at the same time holding that of Madame Danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantaintree where the shade was thick	41.824214935302734
19363/28840	30225m       Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen while that of Villefort tremb	19.401634216308594
19364/28840	This house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a	277.1678466796875
19365/28840	Who said it was a crime asked Villefort with a last	38.34686279296875
19366/28840	How is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden cried Monte Crist	56.68385314941406
19367/28840	And pray what do you call such an action   But who said it was buried alive   Why bury it there if it were dead This garden has never been a	86.02845764160156
19368/28840	What is done to infanticides in this country asked Major Cavalcanti innoc	128.4723663330078
19369/28840	Oh their heads are soon cut off said Dangl	46.69058609008789
19370/28840	I think so am I not right	145.98611450195312
19371/28840	Yes count replied Villefort in a voice now scarcely	66.29905700683594
19372/28840	Indeed count said Madame Danglars I am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that I must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a	41.58085632324219
19373/28840	Monte Cristo bowed and went to Madame de Ville	39.66169738769531
19374/28840	I think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle he	68.2591781616211
19375/28840	But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars I must speak to	26.88597297668457
19376/28840	Where   In my office or in the court if you likethat is the surest	128.24591064453125
19377/28840	At this moment Madame de Villefort	19.702299118041992
19378/28840	Thanks my dear friend said Madame Danglars trying to smile it is over now and I am much	19.754230499267578
19379/28840	The Beggar   The evening passed on Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris which Madame Danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she	38.43800354003906
19380/28840	de Villefort was the first to give the signal of	37.188087463378906
19381/28840	He offered a seat in his landau to Madame Danglars that she might be under the care of his	44.47016906738281
19382/28840	Danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with	88.74066162109375
19383/28840	Cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was	358.6827087402344
19384/28840	Without opposing their arrangements he allowed Morrel ChâteauRenaud and Debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in	49.92332458496094
19385/28840	Danglars more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his	29.577442169189453
19386/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the English fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large irongray	120.21856689453125
19387/28840	Andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the kings	209.48391723632812
19388/28840	He contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the majors little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his banknotes had immediately converted them into an available	132.2880401611328
19389/28840	One thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of Danglars for Cavalc	65.09737396240234
19390/28840	The latter faithful to the principle of Horace _nil admirari_ had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were	216.91502380371094
19391/28840	Thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words   Tomorrow sir I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on	60.4217643737793
19392/28840	And I sir said Danglars shall be most happy to receive	34.088619232177734
19393/28840	Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Hôtel des Princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his	25.250383377075195
19394/28840	To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave	66.118408203125
19395/28840	As for Andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach	122.9015121459961
19396/28840	The groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to Andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the	173.90335083007812
19397/28840	At that moment a hand touched his	237.52130126953125
19398/28840	The young man turned round thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were	49.97393798828125
19399/28840	What do you want of me he	34.374488830566406
19400/28840	Pardon me my friend if I disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but I want to speak to	28.233903884887695
19401/28840	You have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome	91.8995132446289
19402/28840	Come said Andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want Speak quickly	136.8662872314453
19403/28840	The man said in a low voice I wishI wish you to spare me the walk back to	65.6806869506836
19404/28840	I am very tired and as I have not eaten so good a dinner as you I can scarcely	58.72771453857422
19405/28840	The young man shuddered at this strange	34.26161575317383
19406/28840	Tell me he saidtell me what you want   Well then I want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me	49.42742919921875
19407/28840	Let me at least reach a shady spot said	201.19883728027344
19408/28840	Oh as for that Ill take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horses bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea conferred upon	76.57853698730469
19409/28840	Dont think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he oh no its only because I am tired and also because I have a little business to talk over with	124.65538024902344

19411/28840	It was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the til	96.27184295654297

19413/28840	How does that annoy you   It does not on the contrary I think it will answer my	45.979496002197266
19414/28840	So said Andrea you are speculating upon me   What fine words he uses   I warn you Master Caderousse that you are	46.26912307739258

19431/28840	Oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said Andrea becoming more and more	113.22654724121094

19436/28840	What an appetite you used to have Is it as good now   Oh yes replied Andrea	100.2884292602539
19437/28840	How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left   He is not a prince simply a	57.337013244628906

19454/28840	Meanwhile what are you going to do   I   Yes	11.774441719055176
19455/28840	It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about	66.35054779052734
19456/28840	Since you interest yourself in my affairs I think it is now my turn to ask you some	72.39614868164062
19457/28840	Well I shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a	175.18374633789062
19458/28840	Then in the evening I shall go to the theatre I shall look like some retired	49.00755310058594
19459/28840	Come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be	149.34141540527344
19460/28840	Bossuet And youwhat will you become A peer of France   Ah said Andrea who knows   Major Cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is	103.40657806396484
19461/28840	And now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and	61.56425476074219
19462/28840	Then to justify myself I should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that I left Toulon without giving due notice and I should then be escorted back to the shores of the	88.01280212402344

19464/28840	Certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of Major Cavalcanti was a wilful	97.47403717041016
19465/28840	He drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a	76.31368255615234
19466/28840	But meanwhile Caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long Spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of	66.52951049804688
19467/28840	The two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one	200.8536376953125
19468/28840	Andreas hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some	164.2167510986328
19469/28840	Good Caderousse he said how happy you will	32.884979248046875
19470/28840	I will do my best said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard shutting up his	37.32133102416992
19471/28840	Well then we will go into	100.07598876953125
19472/28840	But how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion It seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on	111.61980438232422
19473/28840	But tell me said Andrea am I to remain bareheaded   Pooh said Caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown	63.34096908569336
19474/28840	Come come enough of this said Cavalc	88.3727798461914
19475/28840	What are you waiting for said Cader	26.000537872314453
19476/28840	I hope I am not the	32.07821273803711
19477/28840	At the first cross street Andrea stopped his horse and Caderousse leaped	92.64625549316406

19482/28840	When he reached the wicket of the Louvre he turned to the left galloped across the Carrousel passed through the Rue SaintRoch and issuing from the Rue de la Michodière he arrived at	68.59822845458984
19483/28840	Danglars door just at the same time that Villeforts landau after having deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg SaintHonoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own	22.577539443969727
19484/28840	No Hermine replied Debray you cannot make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the	37.42412567138672
19485/28840	Danglars was disagreeable certainly but I know how much you care for his illhum	33.114627838134766
19486/28840	Someone has vexed you I will allow no one to annoy	107.49055480957031
19487/28840	You are deceived Lucien I assure you replied Madame Danglars and what I have told you is really the case added to the illhumor you remarked but which I did not think it worth while to allude	37.237361907958984
19488/28840	It was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to themselves or that as Debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to	83.68718719482422
19489/28840	At the door of her apartment the baroness met Mademoiselle Cornélie her confidential	23.212440490722656
19490/28840	What is my daughter doing asked Madame Dangl	22.18686294555664
19491/28840	She practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied Mademoiselle Corné	33.137210845947266
19492/28840	Yet I think I hear her	155.74205017089844
19493/28840	It is Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly who is playing while Mademoiselle Danglars is in	10.396574974060059
19494/28840	Well said Madame Danglars come and undress	20.219362258911133
19495/28840	Debray stretched himself upon a large couch and Madame Danglars passed into her dressingroom with Mademoiselle Corné	19.323823928833008
19496/28840	Lucien said Madame Danglars through the door you are always complaining that Eugénie will not address a word to	36.85185623168945
19497/28840	True said Madame Danglars yet I think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your	96.27247619628906
19498/28840	My study   At least that of the	52.70754623413086
19499/28840	Why so   To ask for an engagement at the	57.217960357666016
19500/28840	Really I never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of	106.24109649658203
19501/28840	Well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as	86.18488311767578
19502/28840	Go Cornélie said Madame Danglars I do not require you any	22.963241577148438
19503/28840	Cornélie obeyed and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to Debr	45.13325881958008
19504/28840	Then she began thoughtfully to caress the little sp	369.4977722167969
19505/28840	Lucien looked at her for a moment in	45.56431198120117
19506/28840	Come Hermine he said after a short time answer candidlysomething vexes youis it not so   30239m       Nothing answered the baron	26.22770118713379
19507/28840	And yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking	119.52824401855469
19508/28840	Debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened	78.87693786621094
19509/28840	At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to	31.4802188873291
19510/28840	Goodevening madame said the banker goodevening	99.2425308227539
19511/28840	Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the	72.77008056640625
19512/28840	Assuming a dignified air she turned round to Debray without answering her	103.050048828125
19513/28840	Debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a motherofpearl knife inlaid with	56.68882751464844
19514/28840	Excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and	98.89116668701172
19515/28840	Debray was petrified not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to	110.50354766845703
19516/28840	The baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock	65.62305450439453
19517/28840	The result was that the proud look entirely failed of its	491.1338806152344
19518/28840	Lucien said the baroness I assure you I have no desire to sleep and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing	43.9306526184082
19519/28840	I am at your service madame replied Lucien cold	16.8476619720459
19520/28840	Do not think I wish to turn you out my dear Debray continued Danglars oh no not at	39.5539665222168
19521/28840	An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely I make such a request I am sure you cannot grudge it to	86.32221984863281
19522/28840	Debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like Nathan in _Athalie	134.55380249023438
19523/28840	It is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over	168.73988342285156
19524/28840	The animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motion	87.97248840332031
19525/28840	Do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving Generally you are only rude but tonight you are	38.301448822021484
19526/28840	It is because I am in a worse humor than usual replied Dangl	43.25385284423828
19527/28840	Hermine looked at the banker with supreme	594.18505859375
19528/28840	These glances frequently exasperated the pride of Danglars but this evening he took no notice of	62.66120529174805
19529/28840	Not so replied Danglars your advice is wrong so I shall not follow	39.44598388671875
19530/28840	My money boxes are my Pactolus as I think	271.2205810546875
19531/28840	Demoustier says and I will not retard its course or disturb its	240.47508239746094
19532/28840	And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune Explain yourself more clearly I beg	214.69427490234375
19533/28840	Oh make yourself easyI am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what I	76.72650146484375
19534/28840	The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700000 francs in the course of an	42.091346740722656
19535/28840	I do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her	28.097749710083008
19536/28840	You understand me perfectly on the contrary said Danglars but if you will persist I will tell you that I have just lost 700000 francs upon the Spanish	21.8659610748291
19537/28840	And pray asked the baroness am I responsible for this loss   Why not   Is it my fault you have lost 700000 francs   Certainly it is not	26.918956756591797
19538/28840	Once for all sir replied the baroness sharply I tell you I will not hear cash named it is a style of language I never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first	71.33348846435547
19539/28840	Oh I can well believe that for neither of them was worth a	104.04351806640625
19540/28840	The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and recounted is odious to	199.9357452392578
19541/28840	I only know one thing I dislike more which is the sound of your	82.74048614501953
19542/28840	Well this surprises me for I thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs   30243m       I What could put such an idea into your head  	51.0003662109375
19543/28840	I should like to know upon what occasion   Oh _mon Dieu_ that is very easily	36.1581916809082
19544/28840	Last February you were the first who told me of the Haitian	191.04464721679688
19545/28840	You had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at Le Havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be	214.74464416503906
19546/28840	I know how clearsighted your dreams are I therefore purchased immediately as many shares as I could of the Haitian debt and I gained 400000 francs by it of which 100000 have been honestly paid to	137.58999633789062
19547/28840	You spent it as you pleased that was your	273.61785888671875
19548/28840	In March there was a question about a grant to a	212.26617431640625
19549/28840	Three companies presented themselves each offering equal	1521.5416259765625
19550/28840	I bought two thirds of the shares of that company as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and I picked up a million from which 250000 francs were paid to you for pin	95.66362762451172
19551/28840	How have you spent this 250000 francsit is no business of	142.39512634277344
19552/28840	When are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impat	38.10871887207031
19553/28840	Patience madame I am coming to	72.62649536132812
19554/28840	In April you went to dine at the	171.57827758789062
19555/28840	You heard a private conversation respecting Spanish affairson the expulsion of Don	229.77781677246094
19556/28840	The expulsion took place and I pocketed 600000 francs the day Charles	261.0811462402344
19557/28840	Of these 600000 francs you took 50000 crown	76.85575866699219
19558/28840	They were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and I asked no questions but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500000 liv	87.11024475097656
19559/28840	Well sir and what then   Ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled	102.36772918701172
19560/28840	Really your manner of speaking   It expresses my meaning and that is all I	66.6463623046875
19561/28840	Well three days after that you talked politics with	202.76100158691406
19562/28840	Debray and you fancied from his words that Don Carlos had returned to	81.8846206665039
19563/28840	Well I sold my shares the news got out and I no longer soldI gave them away next day I find the news was false and by this false report I have lost 700000 franc	122.34410858154297
19564/28840	Well   Well since I gave you a fourth of my gains I think you owe me a fourth of my losses the fourth of 700000 francs is 175000 franc	46.18931198120117
19565/28840	What you say is absurd and I cannot see why	86.92597198486328
19566/28840	Debrays name is mixed up in this	138.01763916015625
19567/28840	Because if you do not possess the 175000 francs I reclaim you must have lent them to your friends and	43.23754119873047

19570/28840	I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been	81.12203216552734
19571/28840	This cost me on your account and mine 100000 franc	58.73759841918945
19572/28840	I said nothing for we must have peace in the house and 100000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too	86.23500061035156
19573/28840	Well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the ministers	250.12237548828125
19574/28840	You understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash	107.8780746459961
19575/28840	But today I find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700000 francs per	59.34420394897461
19576/28840	Stop there madame for this cannot	234.06277465820312
19577/28840	Either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and I will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my housedo you understand madame   Oh this is too much cried Hermine choking you are worse than	87.01800537109375
19578/28840	But continued Danglars I find you did not even pause there   Insults   You are right let us leave these facts alone and reason co	52.52324295043945
19579/28840	I have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good treat me in the same	62.177276611328125
19580/28840	You say you have nothing to do with my cash	60.20319366455078
19581/28840	Do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty	217.65065002441406
19582/28840	Besides how do I know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy I excite has not concerted with	109.1527328491211
19583/28840	Debray to ruin me   A probable thing   Why not Who ever heard of such an occurrence as thisa false telegraphic despatchit is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two teleg	75.40349578857422
19584/28840	It was done on purpose for meI am sure of	55.30781173706055
19585/28840	Yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the ministers secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me 700000 franc	83.6992416381836
19586/28840	But sir said Hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by	103.59303283691406
19587/28840	Debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it Why to accuse the man do you address the woman   Do I know	75.10103607177734
19588/28840	Debraydo I wish to know himdo I wish to know that he gives advicedo I wish to follow itdo I speculate No you do all this not	71.00833892822266
19589/28840	Still it seems to me that as you profit by it   Danglars shrugged his	18.32984733581543
19590/28840	But it has not been so with meI see and always have seen during the last sixteen	69.4845962524414
19591/28840	You may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived	153.0363311767578
19592/28840	What has been the resultthat thanks to my pretended ignorance there is none of your friends from	106.2525405883789
19593/28840	Debray who has not trembled before	46.39167404174805
19594/28840	There is not one who has not treated me as the master of the housethe only title I desire with respect to you there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as I have spoken of them this	72.43486022949219
19595/28840	I will allow you to make me hateful but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all I forbid you to ruin	79.9874496459961

19598/28840	Why did he kill himself instead of you Because he had no cash to	187.74758911132812
19599/28840	Debray has made me lose 700000 francs let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before if not let him become bankrupt for the 250000 livres and do as all bankrupts dodisapp	68.70291137695312
19600/28840	He is a charming fellow I allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than	56.94596481323242
19601/28840	Danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to	43.515472412109375
19602/28840	He shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when Madame Danglars recovered from her halffainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable	49.66189193725586

19604/28840	At this time that is about halfpast twelve Madame Danglars ordered her carriage and went	34.1207389831543
19605/28840	Danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting	54.334877014160156
19606/28840	He gave orders that he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared but at two oclock she had not	26.12767219543457
19607/28840	He then called for his horses drove to the Chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the	110.08181762695312
19608/28840	On leaving the Chamber Danglars who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry reentered his carriage and told the coachman to drive to the Avenue des ChampsÉlysées	55.74460220336914
19609/28840	Monte Cristo was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing	61.52774429321289
19610/28840	While the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and	63.78375244140625
19611/28840	A minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and Monte Cristo	58.91392135620117
19612/28840	Nay said Danglars it is my fault I have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will	56.654422760009766
19613/28840	Not at all on the contrary be seated but what is the matter with you You look careworn really you alarm	68.94021606445312

19615/28840	I have been in illluck for several days said Danglars and I have heard nothing but bad	36.03203201293945
19616/28840	Have you had another fall at the Bourse   No I am safe for a few days at	42.86937713623047
19617/28840	I am only annoyed about a bankrupt of Tri	114.10295867919922
19618/28840	Really Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi   Exactly	49.6918830871582
19619/28840	Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I dont know how long to the amount of 800000 or 900000 francs during the	42.379844665527344
19620/28840	Never a mistake or delaya fellow who paid like a	366.2033386230469
19621/28840	Well I was a million in advance with him and now my fine Jacopo Manfredi suspends payment   Really   It is an unheardof fat	44.44840621948242
19622/28840	I draw upon him for 600000 francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that I hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400000 francs payable at his correspondents in Paris at the end of this	55.072383880615234
19623/28840	I present them but my correspondent has	246.33441162109375
19624/28840	This with my Spanish affairs made a pretty end to the	171.0626220703125
19625/28840	Then you really lost by that affair in Spain   Yes only 700000 francs out of my cash boxnothing more   Why how could you make such a mistakesuch an old stager   Oh it is all my wifes	64.43350219726562
19626/28840	She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to Spain she believes in	256.95465087890625
19627/28840	It is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures	191.74008178710938
19628/28840	On this conviction I allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbroker she speculated and	243.7497100830078
19629/28840	It is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when 700000 francs leave the wifes pocket the husband always finds it	110.00337219238281
19630/28840	But do you mean to say you have not heard of this Why the thing has made a tremendous	53.6712646484375
19631/28840	Yes I heard it spoken of but I did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the B	52.02065658569336
19632/28840	30251m       Then you do not speculate   IHow could I speculate when I already have so much trouble in regulating my income I should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a	59.5340461730957
19633/28840	But touching these Spanish affairs I think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos	74.78277587890625
19634/28840	Well thats what puzzles me replied Danglars the news of the return of Don Carlos was brought by te	37.500404357910156
19635/28840	So that said Monte Cristo you have lost nearly 1700000 francs this	41.13478469848633
19636/28840	Not nearly indeed that is exactly my	188.0909423828125
19637/28840	_Diable_ said Monte Cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a thirdrate	72.7459716796875
19638/28840	Thirdrate said Danglars rather humble what do you mean by that   Certainly continued Monte Cristo I make three assortments in fortunefirstrate secondrate and thirdrate	81.28655242919922
19639/28840	I think this is about your position is it not   Confound it yes replied Dangl	28.519529342651367
19640/28840	The result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the thirdrate house to	184.1060333251953
19641/28840	Oh said Danglars becoming very pale how you are running on   Let us imagine seven such months continued Monte Cristo in the same	46.22940444946289
19642/28840	Do you want money Do you wish me to lend you some   30253m       What a bad calculator you are exclaimed Danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissim	24.512882232666016
19643/28840	I have made money at the same time by speculations which have	54.38475036621094
19644/28840	I have made up the loss of blood by	60.15968704223633

19646/28840	Very good very good But the wound remains and will reopen at the first	321.8179016113281
19647/28840	No for I am only embarked in certainties replied Danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to	92.941162109375
19648/28840	That there should be a famine   Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean k	79.56941986083984

19650/28840	Danglars said Monte Cristo I see I was deceived and that you belong to the class of secondrate	28.37674903869629
19651/28840	I think I may aspire to that honor said Danglars with a smile which reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of	80.35099792480469
19652/28840	But while we are speaking of business Danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what I am to do for	60.20655059814453
19653/28840	Give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems	170.8756103515625
19654/28840	Excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40000 francs payable at sight on you signed by Busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsementof course I immediately counted him over the forty bank	103.22621154785156
19655/28840	Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of ass	86.77775573730469
19656/28840	But that is not all continued Danglars he has opened an account with my house for his	48.49296188354492
19657/28840	May I ask how much he allows the young man   Five thousand francs per	41.921260833740234
19658/28840	I thought I was right in believing that Cavalcanti to be a stingy	66.8503189086914
19659/28840	How can a young man live upon 5000 francs a month   But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more   Do not advance it the father will never repay	62.84361267089844
19660/28840	You do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular mis	170.3987274169922
19661/28840	And by whom were they recommended to you   Oh by the house of Fenzi one of the best in	73.55049896240234
19662/28840	I do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the	69.19621276855469
19663/28840	Would you not trust the Cavalcanti   I oh I would advance ten millions on his	64.28545379638672
19664/28840	I was only speaking in reference to the secondrate fortunes we were mentioning just	97.72254943847656
19665/28840	And with all this how unassuming he is I should never have taken him for anything more than a mere	91.14391326904297
19666/28840	And you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no	85.2285385131836

19669/28840	The young man is better said Dangl	21.0535888671875
19670/28840	Yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared toler	201.37948608398438
19671/28840	Why   Because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told	73.17618560791016
19672/28840	He has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to Paris	100.25619506835938
19673/28840	Ah I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked Danglars carelessly they like to unite their	146.01730346679688
19674/28840	It is usual certainly but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other	140.71824645996094
19675/28840	I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to France to choose a	78.6540298461914
19676/28840	Do you think so   I am sure of	12.665316581726074
19677/28840	And you have heard his fortune mentioned   Nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a far	116.09510803222656
19678/28840	And what is your opinion   I ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal	45.6199951171875
19679/28840	Certainly said Danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of	64.97859954833984
19680/28840	Very little at least I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in Lu	127.94844055175781
19681/28840	Ah he has a palace said Danglars laughing come that is	50.705623626708984
19682/28840	Yes and more than that he lets it to the Minister of Finance while he lives in a simple	67.17493438720703
19683/28840	Oh as I told you before I think the old fellow is very	62.03483200073242
19684/28840	I scarcely know him I think I have seen him three times in my life all I know relating to him is through Busoni and	58.158573150634766
19685/28840	Never mind accept my thanks for the client you have sent	129.5059814453125

19687/28840	By the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune   Oh that depends upon	169.80685424804688
19688/28840	I know an Italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in Tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a	145.68798828125

19692/28840	But do you wish to marry Andrea my dear	44.82699966430664
19693/28840	Danglars that you are asking so many questions   _Ma foi_ said Danglars it would not be a bad speculation I fancy and you know I am a spec	17.918752670288086
19694/28840	But he is betrothed to your daughter I believe   Well	48.313804626464844
19695/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more	33.47830581665039
19696/28840	Oh I do not mean her fortune only but tell me   What   Why did you not invite	44.315513610839844
19697/28840	and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner   I did so but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea	32.26838684082031
19698/28840	Yes yes said Danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of	37.15261459350586
19699/28840	Why so   Because it is the air she always breathed in her	92.57247161865234
19700/28840	Monte Cristo took no notice of this illnatured	338.3863525390625

19702/28840	And for this very reason said Danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic I prefer	49.491485595703125
19703/28840	Still I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti   The MorcerfsStay my dear count said Danglars you are a man of the world are you not   I think	20.23138427734375

19720/28840	I acknowledge I would have given anything to find it	59.75881576538086
19721/28840	It would be very easy if you much wished it   How so   Probably you have some correspondent in Greece   I should think	45.43547821044922
19722/28840	Well write to your correspondent in Yanina and ask him what part was played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali Tepel	45.6422233581543
19723/28840	You are right exclaimed Danglars rising quickly I will write	77.98799896240234

19727/28840	We have said that at halfpast twelve oclock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the	29.323406219482422
19728/28840	She directed her course towards the Faubourg Saint Germain went down the Rue Mazarine and stopped at the Passage du PontNe	52.93183135986328
19729/28840	She descended and went through the	122.9603042602539

19731/28840	At the Rue Guénégaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the Rue de Har	75.35198211669922
19732/28840	As soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bon	78.35546112060547
19733/28840	She then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocketmirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone	142.8096466064453
19734/28840	The cab crossed the PontNeuf and entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon reached the Salle des PasPerd	66.3647232055664
19735/28840	There was a great deal going on that morning and many businesslike persons at the Palais businesslike persons pay very little attention to women and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her	116.91297912597656
19736/28840	There was a great press of people in	162.71078491210938
19737/28840	de Villeforts antechamber but Madame Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her	30.934856414794922
19738/28840	The instant she appeared the doorkeeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to	92.53738403320312
19739/28840	Nevertheless sir you see I have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for	116.98485565185547

19747/28840	If my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has	97.82083129882812
19748/28840	I was not so in my youth I was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marse	37.43660354614258
19749/28840	But since then everything has changed in and about me I am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my	136.1302947998047
19750/28840	It is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch	108.50282287597656
19751/28840	Thus the greater number of a mans errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped	157.705810546875
19752/28840	In any case sir you will allow replied Madame Danglars that even if the fault were alone mine I last night received a severe punishment for	115.98395538330078
19753/28840	Poor thing said Villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet   Well   Well I must tell	43.22350311279297
19754/28840	Collect all your courage for you have not yet heard	48.501670837402344

19758/28840	Well no madamethis is the terrible news I have to tell you said Villefort in a hollow voiceno nothing was found beneath the flowers there was no child disinterred	72.24018096923828
19759/28840	You must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble   What can you mean asked Madame Danglars shudder	29.510574340820312

19765/28840	Madame Danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but Villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her	38.304325103759766

19768/28840	I felt pain I wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice I fell lifeless and fancied myself	170.23062133789062

19781/28840	I pretended that I disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wifes father and mother should pass into the hands of	83.9864501953125
19782/28840	I offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded 6000 franc	197.5751495361328

19785/28840	No one had entered the house since I had left	58.397560119628906
19786/28840	It was five oclock in the afternoon I ascended into the red room and waited for	75.21829986572266
19787/28840	There all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double	317.63665771484375

19789/28840	Night arrived I allowed it to become quite	304.5057373046875

19791/28840	I seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and I dared not turn	200.31813049316406
19792/28840	My heart beat so violently that I feared my wound would	142.31231689453125
19793/28840	At length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood	203.8314971923828
19794/28840	I understood that I had nothing to fear that I should neither be seen nor heard so I decided upon descending to the	87.39924621582031
19795/28840	I descended the staircase step by step the only thing I could not conquer was a strange trembling in my	134.98353576660156
19796/28840	I grasped the railings if I had relaxed my hold for a moment I should have	115.35568237304688
19797/28840	Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall I took it and advanced towards the thick	61.54678726196289
19798/28840	I had provided myself with a dark	124.15921020507812

19800/28840	It was the end of November all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my	98.44833374023438
19801/28840	My terror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket that I took a pistol from my pocket and armed	86.38970947265625
19802/28840	I fancied continually that I saw the figure of the Corsican between the	76.44482421875
19803/28840	I examined the thicket with my dark lantern it was	160.70982360839844
19804/28840	I looked carefully around I was indeed aloneno noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the	151.46531677246094
19805/28840	I tied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the precise spot where I stopped to dig the	168.5900421142578
19806/28840	The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow	164.85948181152344
19807/28840	Still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there I had turned up the	237.88877868652344
19808/28840	The hour then for which I had been waiting during the last year had at length	92.88715362548828
19809/28840	How I worked how I hoped how I struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade But no I found nothing though I had made a hole twice as large as the	160.2625274658203
19810/28840	I thought I had been deceivedhad mistaken the	157.85960388183594
19811/28840	I turned around I looked at the trees I tried to recall the details which had struck me at the	71.58786010742188
19812/28840	A cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my	327.2737121582031
19813/28840	On my right I saw the tree behind me the	271.0562744140625
19814/28840	I stood in the same attitude and threw myself	111.87924194335938
19815/28840	I rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still I found nothing nothingthe chest was no longer there   30269m       The chest no longer there murmured Madame Danglars choking with	61.247615814208984
19816/28840	Think not I contented myself with this one effort continued Ville	85.29891204833984
19817/28840	I thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but I could find	139.64202880859375
19818/28840	Then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a	81.76143646240234
19819/28840	In the last case I must wait for daylight to renew my	105.63475799560547
19820/28840	I remained in the room and	55.23370361328125
19821/28840	Oh Heaven   30271m       When daylight dawned I went down	39.35599136352539
19822/28840	My first visit was to the thick	53.91071319580078
19823/28840	I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the	65.02918243408203

19826/28840	Supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart I returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for	100.951171875
19827/28840	Oh cried Madame Danglars it was enough to drive you mad   I hoped for a moment that it might said Villefort but that happiness was denied	38.352787017822266
19828/28840	However recovering my strength and my ideas Why said I should that man have carried away the corpse   But you said replied Madame Danglars he would require it as a	80.89852905273438

19849/28840	This woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to	118.43406677246094
19850/28840	But you should have inquired for the woman you should have traced	130.98721313476562

19852/28840	They traced her to Châlons and there they lost	122.66754150390625
19853/28840	They lost her   Yes	135.1618194580078
19854/28840	Madame Danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every	35.74150085449219
19855/28840	And this is all said she and you stopped there   Oh no said Villefort I never ceased to search and to	46.821434020996094
19856/28840	However the last two or three years I had allowed myself some resp	48.9411506652832
19857/28840	But now I will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my	105.08148193359375
19858/28840	But replied Madame Danglars the Count of Monte Cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he	29.27329444885254
19859/28840	Oh the wickedness of man is very great said Villefort since it surpasses the goodness of	94.94334411621094
19860/28840	Did you observe that mans eyes while he was speaking to us  	55.216400146484375
19861/28840	But have you ever watched him carefully   Doubtless he is capricious but that is all one thing alone struck meof all the exquisite things he placed before us he touched	102.42353057861328
19862/28840	I might have suspected he was poisoning	152.831787109375
19863/28840	And you see you would have been	35.90727996826172
19864/28840	But believe me that man has other	203.7477264404297
19865/28840	For that reason I wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against	88.24726104736328
19866/28840	Tell me cried Villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection   Never to	94.43358612060547
19867/28840	You understand me replied Villefort affectionately when I say anyonepardon my urgencyto anyone living I mean   Yes yes I understand very well ejaculated the baroness never I swear to	74.8784408569336
19868/28840	Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning Do you keep a journal   No my life has been passed in frivolity I wish to forget it	63.08013153076172
19869/28840	Do you talk in your sleep   30275m       I sleep soundly like a child do you not remember   The color mounted to the baronesss face and Villefort turned awfully	29.74489402770996
19870/28840	It is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be	38.00002670288086
19871/28840	Well I understand what I now have to do replied Ville	36.16499328613281
19872/28840	In less than one week from this time I will ascertain who this	287.2109069824219
19873/28840	de Monte Cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a	82.5870361328125
19874/28840	Villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard	48.080326080322266
19875/28840	Then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the	52.581329345703125
19876/28840	Madame Danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for	44.5429801940918
19877/28840	A Summer Ball   The same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the procureur a travellingcarriage entered the Rue du Helder passed through the gateway of	38.45489501953125
19878/28840	In a moment the door was opened and Madame de Morcerf alighted leaning on her sons	20.85365867614746
19879/28840	Albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the ChampsÉlysées to the house of Monte Crist	28.33125877380371
19880/28840	The count received him with his habitual	114.32221221923828
19881/28840	It was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that mans	74.44828796386719
19882/28840	Those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable	103.8434829711914
19883/28840	Morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his	70.35227966308594
19884/28840	Monte Cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable	369.5176696777344
19885/28840	From Dieppe   No from Tré	77.52757263183594
19886/28840	Indeed   And I have come at once to see	22.335025787353516
19887/28840	That is extremely kind of you said Monte Cristo with a tone of perfect	39.50725555419922
19888/28840	And what is the news   You should not ask a stranger a foreigner for	66.04578399658203
19889/28840	I know it but in asking for news I mean have you done anything for me   Had you commissioned me said Monte Cristo feigning uneas	36.94855880737305
19890/28840	Come come said Albert do not assume so much	106.1687240600586
19891/28840	It is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at Tréport I felt the electric shock you have either been working for me or thinking of	112.82830810546875
19892/28840	Possibly said Monte Cristo I have indeed thought of you but the magnetic wire I was guiding acted indeed without my	136.60215759277344
19893/28840	30277m       Indeed Pray tell me how it	27.661754608154297

19897/28840	Is he not a count   What can I know of him He calls himself	68.25846099853516
19898/28840	I of course give him the same title and everyone else does	195.67599487304688
19899/28840	What a strange man you are What next You say	258.50177001953125
19900/28840	Danglars dined here   Yes with Count Cavalcanti the marquis his father Madame Danglars	35.66830825805664
19901/28840	Did they speak of me   Not a	46.37974548339844
19902/28840	Why so I thought you wished them to forget you   If they did not speak of me I am sure they thought about me and I am in	50.92277526855469
19903/28840	How will that affect you since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the number here who thought of you Truly she might have thought of you at	50.75399398803711
19904/28840	I have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which I think of	41.61367416381836
19905/28840	Touching sympathy So you hate each other said the	317.911376953125
19906/28840	Listen said Morcerfif Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families I am ready to agree to the	48.03504180908203
19907/28840	But as this dream cannot be realized since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens	87.6039810180664
19908/28840	One may forsake a mistress but a wifegood heavens There she must always be and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be	57.84452438354492
19909/28840	Yes for I often wish for what is	92.73115539550781
19910/28840	What is that   To find such a wife as my father	47.317264556884766
19911/28840	Monte Cristo turned pale and looked at Albert while playing with some magnificent	156.2327423095703
19912/28840	Your father was fortunate then said	121.76512908935547

19914/28840	30279m       That is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single	60.15521240234375
19915/28840	Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Dangl	18.619796752929688
19916/28840	Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugénie perceives I am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has	78.41339111328125
19917/28840	That is what I call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry	147.99691772460938
19918/28840	Apropos continued he Franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him I think   I said Monte Cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that I did not like	56.976959228515625

19920/28840	Did you say he was coming   Yes summoned by	97.58657836914062
19921/28840	de Villefort who is apparently as anxious to get Mademoiselle Valentine married as	54.3952522277832
19922/28840	Danglars is to see Mademoiselle Eugénie	10.498236656188965
19923/28840	It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grownup daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise ones pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is	142.4979705810547

19925/28840	Still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his	238.19229125976562
19926/28840	He entertains a very high opinion of	189.42909240722656
19927/28840	Which they deserve do they not   I believe they	57.603050231933594
19928/28840	de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a just	97.25137329101562
19929/28840	There is then one said Monte Cristo whom you do not condemn like poor Danglars   Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied Albert	43.50686264038086
19930/28840	Indeed my dear sir said Monte Cristo you are revoltingly fopp	43.73411178588867

19932/28840	Let things take their course perhaps you may not have to	62.7176399230957
19933/28840	Doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement   I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do	35.03604507446289
19934/28840	Danglars would give double that sum to attain the same	60.029823303222656
19935/28840	Am I indeed so happy said Albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his	76.73795318603516
19936/28840	Danglars any reason   Ah there is your proud and selfish	68.84954071044922

20009/28840	I will come again at that time replied the visitor who then	81.4273452758789
20010/28840	At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue Férou drove up to the green	63.16423034667969
20011/28840	He knocked and it opened immediately to admit	284.9949645996094
20012/28840	From the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good	77.67713928222656
20013/28840	Is the abbé at home asked	45.549049377441406
20014/28840	Yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the val	47.72119903564453
20015/28840	Have I the honor of addressing the Abbé Busoni asked the	23.42230987548828

20018/28840	One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris   Yes sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and bl	47.134002685546875
20019/28840	The abbé replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the	76.80634307861328
20020/28840	I am at your service sir said the abbé with a marked Italian	18.8433895111084
20021/28840	The mission with which I am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is	109.9092025756836
20022/28840	Your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which I am deputed to see	81.7305679321289
20023/28840	It is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the	153.00320434570312
20024/28840	Provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my	108.05775451660156
20025/28840	I am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and God and not between me and human	149.14735412597656
20026/28840	Do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your	89.39181518554688
20027/28840	At this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained	100.23262786865234
20028/28840	Excuse me abbé said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eyes very	64.42941284179688
20029/28840	I will come at once to the	32.30854034423828
20030/28840	Well be it solet us not dispute about words and since	430.271484375
20031/28840	Zaccone are the same   Absolutely the	105.78239440917969
20032/28840	I asked you if you knew him   Extremely	46.4903450012207
20033/28840	Who is he   The son of a rich shipbuilder in	75.21538543701172
20034/28840	I know that is the report but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague	99.85091400146484
20035/28840	However replied the abbé with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the	61.307979583740234
20036/28840	Are you sure of what you assert   What do you mean by that question   Understand sir I do not in the least suspect your veracity I ask if you are certain of it   I knew his father	46.014076232910156
20037/28840	Ah indeed   And when a child I often played with the son in the timbery	119.17033386230469
20038/28840	But whence does he derive the title of count   You are aware that may be	51.96759796142578
20039/28840	And his immense riches whence does he procure them   They may not be so very	121.72623443603516
20040/28840	How much do you suppose he possesses   From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per ann	30.629737854003906
20041/28840	That is reasonable said the visitor I have heard he had three or four	61.42092514038086
20042/28840	Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of	254.18748474121094
20043/28840	But I was told he had four millions per ann	82.03246307373047
20044/28840	Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo   Certainly everyone who has come from Palermo Naples or Rome to France by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen	71.34916687011719
20045/28840	I am told it is a delightful place   It is a	40.26655197143555
20046/28840	And why has the count bought a rock   For the sake of being a	92.1645736694336
20047/28840	In Italy one must have territorial possessions to be a	197.84136962890625
20048/28840	You have doubtless heard the adventures of	112.81120300292969
20049/28840	Zaccones youth   The fathers   No the	585.3029174804688
20050/28840	I know nothing certain at that period of his life I lost sight of my young	103.34323120117188
20051/28840	Was he in the wars   I think he entered the	54.17698287963867

20053/28840	Are you not his confessor   No sir I believe he is a	36.085357666015625
20054/28840	A Lutheran   I say I believe such is the case I do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in	113.55982971191406
20055/28840	Doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police I ask you what you know of	53.72941589355469
20056/28840	He passes for a very charitable	478.2867126464844

20059/28840	He is a Quaker then   Exactly he is a Quaker with the exception of the peculiar	41.99720001220703
20060/28840	Has he any friends   Yes everyone who knows him is his	99.4943618774414

20065/28840	Do you know his abode   Its somewhere in the Chaussée dAntin but I know neither the street nor the	36.169189453125

20068/28840	Now sir I have but one question more to ask and I charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candid	70.4161148071289
20069/28840	What is it sir   Do you know with what design	32.78590774536133

20071/28840	What is it sir   To make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the Count of Pisani at Paler	45.64501953125
20072/28840	Do you know about that institution   I have heard of	32.61046600341797
20073/28840	Having said this the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his	67.60211181640625
20074/28840	The visitor either understood the abbés meaning or had no more questions to ask he arose and the abbé accompanied him to the	72.13774108886719
20075/28840	However   My resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevol	93.74956512451172
20076/28840	The abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of	69.88809204101562
20077/28840	An hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the Rue FontaineSaintGeorges and stopped at	72.56138610839844
20078/28840	The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten o	78.60784149169922
20079/28840	As the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that Lord Wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock	64.49568939208984
20080/28840	The visitor was introduced into the drawingroom which was like all other furnished drawing	109.31378173828125
20081/28840	It was illuminated by lamps with groundglass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoys weak	244.73207092285156
20082/28840	After ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten at the fifth stroke the door opened and Lord Wilmore	79.81588745117188

20084/28840	His first remark on entering was   You know sir I do not speak French   I know you do not like to converse in our language replied the	52.408145904541016
20085/28840	But you may use it replied Lord Wilmore I understand	53.07659149169922
20086/28840	And I replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of English to keep up the	303.5273742675781
20087/28840	Do not put yourself to the slightest	291.40625
20088/28840	Aw said Lord Wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of Great	61.742496490478516
20089/28840	The envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with English coolness and having finished   I understand said he	114.28743743896484
20090/28840	30293m       Then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the Abbé Bus	22.442134857177734
20091/28840	It was there Wilmore had first met him and fought against him and in that war Zaccone had been taken prisoner sent to England and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by	132.39114379882812
20092/28840	Then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in Greece broke out and he had served in the Grecian	122.84736633300781
20093/28840	While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from	79.95146179199219
20094/28840	After the battle of Navarino when the Greek government was consolidated he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district which was given	176.17852783203125
20095/28840	Hence that immense fortune which in Lord Wilmores opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annuma precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the	231.36697387695312
20096/28840	But asked the visitor do you know why he came to France   He is speculating in railways said Lord Wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to	65.91002655029297
20097/28840	How much does he spend yearly asked the pre	192.71673583984375
20098/28840	Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said Lord Wilmore he is a	15.694700241088867
20099/28840	Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avar	158.47109985351562
20100/28840	Do you know his house at Auteuil  	17.981647491455078
20101/28840	What do you know respecting it   Do you wish to know why he bought it  	23.950054168701172
20102/28840	The count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in	171.1529541015625
20103/28840	He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagnères Luchon and Cautere	287.14984130859375
20104/28840	He is going to turn his house into a _Badhaus_ as the Germans term	71.0264892578125
20105/28840	He has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous	104.2550277709961
20106/28840	Now as I dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him I am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take	101.48753356933594
20107/28840	What was the cause of your quarrel   When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my	33.63129806518555
20108/28840	Why do you not seek revenge   I have already fought three duels with him said the Englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sab	73.00395202636719

20110/28840	The Englishman turned down his shirtcollar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent	161.94332885742188
20111/28840	So that you see there is a deadly feud between	55.13768005371094
20112/28840	But said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if I understand you	46.362239837646484
20113/28840	Aw said the Englishman I practice shooting every day and every other day Grisier comes to my	128.15426635742188
20114/28840	This was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the Englishman appeared to	84.44436645507812

20121/28840	At this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to	82.41461181640625
20122/28840	Until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the diningroom or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the	103.36101531982422

20159/28840	Why so   Because it is a secret just	63.71359634399414
20160/28840	Then the news originated   At the prefects last	102.94725799560547
20161/28840	Paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made	71.7203598022461
20162/28840	Well well Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too	119.08921813964844
20163/28840	Indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so	81.86595153808594
20164/28840	Poor count And is he aware of the danger he has been in   I think	74.985595703125
20165/28840	Then it will be but charitable to inform	55.870601654052734
20166/28840	When he arrives I will not fail to do	52.098289489746094
20167/28840	Just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to Madame de Ville	33.41178894042969
20168/28840	Madame said Albert allow me to present to you	57.934207916259766
20169/28840	Maximilian Morrel captain of Spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest	60.342323303222656
20170/28840	I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo replied Madame de Villefort turning away with marked coldness of	17.619977951049805
20171/28840	This answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor Mor	104.93817138671875
20172/28840	But a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her	123.05120849609375
20173/28840	They might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their	358.02142333984375
20174/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo had just	15.71194839477539
20175/28840	We have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he	121.2103271484375
20176/28840	Many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more _significant_ if the expression may be	186.2236328125
20177/28840	Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be	74.79900360107422
20178/28840	Yet the Parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense	113.78749084472656
20179/28840	She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to	34.35218811035156
20180/28840	No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow Monte Cristo directed his steps to Albert who received him cord	69.3123550415039
20181/28840	Have you seen my mother asked	93.21131896972656
20182/28840	I have just had the pleasure replied the count but I have not seen your	29.07254981994629
20183/28840	See he is down there talking politics with that little group of great gen	193.25442504882812
20184/28840	Indeed said Monte Cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great	72.27738952636719
20185/28840	And for what kind of talent are they celebrated You know there are different	332.0779724121094
20186/28840	That tall harshlooking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of Rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the	172.08766174316406
20187/28840	The thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his	140.87730407714844
20188/28840	I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the Legion of Honor was made an	42.00038146972656
20189/28840	Come said Monte Cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely	32.62961959838867
20190/28840	I suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a	119.98233032226562
20191/28840	Indeed said Monte Cristo so this gentleman is an Academician   Within the last week he has been made one of the learned	59.44554138183594
20192/28840	And what is his especial talent   His talent I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits he makes fowls eat madder and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whale	150.98138427734375
20193/28840	And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this   No of the French	42.34074020385742
20194/28840	But what has the French Academy to do with all this   I was going to tell	27.160263061523438
20195/28840	It seems   That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless   No that his style of writing is very	158.58934020996094
20196/28840	This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out   Albert	92.35047912597656
20197/28840	And the other one demanded the	138.2987518310547
20198/28840	That one   Yes the	49.608238220214844
20199/28840	The one in the dark blue coat  	44.11476135253906
20200/28840	He is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a	52.08287811279297
20201/28840	He was very successful upon that	236.6298065185547
20202/28840	He stood badly with the Liberal papers but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the	154.81687927246094
20203/28840	They talk of making him an	158.86550903320312
20204/28840	30303m       And what are his claims to the peerage   He has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the _Siècle_ and voted five or six years on the ministerial	60.066932678222656
20205/28840	Bravo viscount said Monte Cristo smiling you are a delightful _cicerone	36.36925506591797
20206/28840	And now you will do me a favor will you not   What is it   Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn	44.40748977661133
20207/28840	Just then the count felt his arm	169.9423828125
20208/28840	Ah is it you baron said	43.01327133178711
20209/28840	Why do you call me baron said Danglars you know that I care nothing for my	33.42196273803711
20210/28840	I am not like you viscount you like your title do you not   Certainly replied Albert seeing that without my title I should be nothing while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the	59.564422607421875
20211/28840	Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July replied Dangl	47.93564987182617
20212/28840	Unfortunately said Monte Cristo ones title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of France or academician for example the millionaires Franck  Poulmann of Frankfurt who have just become bankrupt	157.69747924804688
20213/28840	Yes I received the news this evening by a	160.60018920898438
20214/28840	I had about a million in their hands but warned in time I withdrew it a month	133.0054931640625
20215/28840	Ah _mon Dieu_ exclaimed Danglars they have drawn on me for 200000 francs   Well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per	52.63240432739258
20216/28840	Yes but it is too late said Danglars I have honored their	24.836502075195312
20217/28840	Then said Monte Cristo here are 200000 francs gone after   Hush do not mention these things said Danglars then approaching Monte Cristo he added especially before young	59.686458587646484
20218/28840	Cavalcanti after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in	132.41830444335938
20219/28840	Albert had left the count to speak to his mother Danglars to converse with young Cavalcanti Monte Cristo was for an instant	30.31486701965332
20220/28840	The footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with 	250.0062255859375
20221/28840	Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the waiter was presented to him he took no refresh	71.70135498046875
20222/28840	Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of	46.7592658996582
20223/28840	Albert she asked did you notice that   What mother   That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of	56.03065490722656
20224/28840	Yes but then he breakfasted with meindeed he made his first appearance in the world on that	85.55118560791016
20225/28840	de Morcerfs murmured Mercédès and since he has been here I have watched	24.35116195678711
20226/28840	Well   Well he has taken nothing	55.698768615722656
20227/28840	Approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking	435.65802001953125
20228/28840	But why mother   Just to please me Albert said Mercédè	54.071876525878906
20229/28840	Albert kissed his mothers hand and drew near the	74.98151397705078
20230/28840	Another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately	358.2073669433594
20231/28840	Albert rejoined his mother she was very	52.96124267578125
20232/28840	Well said she you see he refuses   Yes but why need this annoy you   You know Albert women are singular	95.88709259033203
20233/28840	I should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an	96.68523406982422
20234/28840	Perhaps he cannot reconcile himself to the French style of living and might prefer something	135.99105834960938
20235/28840	Oh no I have seen him eat of everything in Italy no doubt he does not feel inclined this	72.58367156982422
20236/28840	And besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we	110.34342956542969
20237/28840	I do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as the	57.095481872558594
20238/28840	In a word said Mercédès it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was	38.99845504760742
20239/28840	A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the	140.1565399169922
20240/28840	Dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joyeveryone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated	245.11268615722656
20241/28840	At the same time Mercédès reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes	28.554323196411133
20242/28840	She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the	70.30570220947266
20243/28840	Do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer I should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not	184.18173217773438
20244/28840	Ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung _Partant pour la Syrie_we will not go alone to the	158.8940887451172
20245/28840	Then said Mercédès I will lead the	19.22760581970215
20246/28840	Turning towards Monte Cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm   The count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on Mercédè	52.69993209838867
20247/28840	It was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one	65.8766860961914
20248/28840	He offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camell	81.3968734741211
20249/28840	Behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of	109.45361328125
20250/28840	Bread and Salt   Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her	67.1830062866211
20251/28840	It led through a grove of lindens to a conserv	292.3174133300781
20252/28840	It was too warm in the room was it not count she	84.58323669433594
20253/28840	Yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blind	38.06918716430664
20254/28840	As he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of Mercédès trem	35.383480072021484
20255/28840	But you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold   Do you know where I am leading you said the countess without replying to the	73.19782257080078
20256/28840	No madame replied Monte Cristo but you see I make no	22.56904411315918
20257/28840	We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the gro	65.54312133789062
20258/28840	The count looked at Mercédès as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from	46.28304672241211
20259/28840	They reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our	117.57332611083984
20260/28840	The countess left the arm of Monte Cristo and gathered a bunch of Muscatel	47.8458251953125
20261/28840	See count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelidssee our French grapes are not to be compared I know with yours of Sicily and Cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern	111.4492416381836
20262/28840	Do you refuse said Mercédès in a tremulous	15.59931468963623
20263/28840	Pray excuse me madame replied Monte Cristo but I never eat Muscatel	38.31955337524414
20264/28840	A magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial	310.7641296386719
20265/28840	Mercédès drew near and plucked the	42.83512878417969
20266/28840	What again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain	206.918212890625
20267/28840	A long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the	231.94920349121094
20268/28840	Count added Mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful Arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same	86.25066375732422
20269/28840	I know it madame replied the count but we are in France and not in Arabia and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one	65.88935089111328
20270/28840	Certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be   The answer was so little like the one Mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a gro	60.801300048828125
20271/28840	They went the whole length of the garden without uttering a	43.910743713378906
20272/28840	Sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply   I have suffered deeply madame answered Monte Crist	50.726219177246094
20273/28840	But now you are happy   Doubtless replied the count since no one hears me	49.441123962402344
20274/28840	And your present happiness has it softened your heart   My present happiness equals my past misery said the	117.17170715332031
20275/28840	Are you not married asked the count	54.05536651611328
20276/28840	I married exclaimed Monte Cristo shuddering who could have told you so   No one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the Opera with a young and lovely	58.893280029296875
20277/28840	She is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople madame the daughter of a	72.08282470703125
20278/28840	I have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the	80.09481811523438

20281/28840	How can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life   It is not my fault mad	70.24652099609375
20282/28840	At Malta I loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me	133.05877685546875
20283/28840	I thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my	68.61389923095703
20284/28840	This is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of	37.3044548034668
20285/28840	Perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and I suffered more than they would have done in my place that is	61.365455627441406
20286/28840	The countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for	129.84036254882812
20287/28840	Yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heartone can only love onceand did you ever see her again   30309m      	52.222808837890625
20288/28840	Never   I never returned to the country where she	42.909114837646484
20289/28840	She is then now at Malta   I think	66.66663360595703
20290/28840	And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer   Hery	149.03433227539062
20291/28840	But only her do you then still hate those who separated you   I hate them Not at all why should I The countess placed herself before Monte Cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed	88.4837646484375
20292/28840	Madame I never eat Muscatel grapes replied Monte Cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned	39.07665252685547
20293/28840	The countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of	127.20687866210938
20294/28840	Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to	92.33700561523438
20295/28840	Oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened   What What has happened asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life did you say a misfortune Indeed I should expect misfortun	66.72531127929688
20296/28840	Well   He comes to fetch his wife and	33.363006591796875
20297/28840	Why so   Because Madame de SaintMéran is just arrived in Paris bringing the news of	24.801542282104492

20302/28840	Ah indeed   So Franz must	191.90133666992188
20303/28840	And she took two or three steps	89.69808959960938
20304/28840	Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them	90.61048126220703
20305/28840	We are friends are we not she	154.6134033203125

20307/28840	The countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her	47.3818359375

20348/28840	He was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ballroom that Valentine ran to him saying   Oh father some misfortune has happened   Your grandmamma has just arrived Valentine said	45.64664077758789

20358/28840	Alas sir exclaimed Barrois a great misfortune has	73.41478729248047

20369/28840	Within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a	143.86520385742188

20371/28840	Valentine kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears whose sources he thought must be	61.01936721801758

20461/28840	I will go and take a turn in the garden to recover	47.765869140625
20462/28840	The doctor pressed Valentines hand and while he visited her grandmother she descended the	159.96163940429688
20463/28840	We need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite	261.8325500488281
20464/28840	After remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the	105.88700866699219
20465/28840	As usual Valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering	268.9682922363281
20466/28840	The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of w	124.24235534667969
20467/28840	30327m       She then turned towards the	34.30914306640625
20468/28840	As she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her	96.49211883544922
20469/28840	She stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of Maximil	139.07525634765625
20470/28840	The Promise   It was indeed Maximilian Morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous	54.45772933959961
20471/28840	With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of Madame de SaintMéran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at	61.30415344238281
20472/28840	de Villeforts in connection with his attachment for	111.3536148071289
20473/28840	His presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnutt	120.25285339355469
20474/28840	Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through	123.48941040039062
20475/28840	Morrel called her and she ran to the	100.73641204833984

20478/28840	This is indeed a house of mourning said Valentine speak Maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already	201.0316925048828
20479/28840	Dear Valentine said Morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen I entreat you what I am about to say is very	33.03532409667969
20480/28840	When are you to be married   I will tell you all said Valentine from you I have nothing to	23.351160049438477
20481/28840	This morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom I depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of	130.71641540527344
20482/28840	dÉpinay and the following day the contract will be	57.99167251586914
20483/28840	A deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he	142.074462890625
20484/28840	Alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own	226.4138946533203
20485/28840	The sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and I will not endeavor to prevent	65.27722930908203

20489/28840	I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since said Morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and I of your grief when a carriage rolled into the	67.93268585205078
20490/28840	Never till then had I placed any confidence in presentiments but now I cannot help believing them	281.3232727050781
20491/28840	At the sound of that carriage I shuddered soon I heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did Don	141.92320251464844
20492/28840	Perhaps I turned pale and trembled but certainly I smiled and five minutes after I left without having heard one word that had	99.41288757324219
20493/28840	Valentine the time has arrived when you must answer	57.558101654052734

20499/28840	The idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to	88.10497283935547
20500/28840	What do you say Maximilian asked	21.91523551940918

20503/28840	You are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear Maximil	53.82588577270508
20504/28840	No no I shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you	139.20257568359375
20505/28840	But to grieve my fatherto disturb my grandmothers last momentsnever   You are right said Morrel	64.78829193115234

20510/28840	What would you have proposed Maximilian had you found me willing to accede   It is not for me to	36.95151901245117
20511/28840	You are wrong you must advise me what to	86.05134582519531
20512/28840	Do you seriously ask my advice Valentine   Certainly dear Maximilian for if it is good I will follow it you know my devotion to	51.32987594604492
20513/28840	Valentine said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my	106.00360870361328
20514/28840	Oh if you refuse my advice   What do you advise said Valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sigh	35.84134292602539
20515/28840	I am free replied Maximilian and rich enough to support	43.208251953125
20516/28840	I swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your	146.22743225097656
20517/28840	You make me tremble said the young	31.442113876342773

20520/28840	Yesif I die   Well Valentine resumed Maximilian I can only say again that you are	41.662506103515625
20521/28840	Truly it is I who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most well	118.32071685791016
20522/28840	It is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to	71.75330352783203
20523/28840	I think only that I have known you not a whole	70.9979476928711
20524/28840	From the day I first saw you all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your	128.81153869628906
20525/28840	One day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to	126.5136489868164
20526/28840	Now I think no more I say only that fortune has turned against meI had thought to gain heaven and now I have lost	103.97998809814453
20527/28840	It is an everyday occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has	85.30879974365234
20528/28840	Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness Valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her	117.37744140625
20529/28840	But in a word what are you going to do asked	27.048484802246094
20530/28840	I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your	60.071861267089844

20534/28840	Then adieu Valentine   Valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as Morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung	54.5179443359375
20535/28840	I must know what you mean to do said	27.30547332763672
20536/28840	Where are you going   Oh fear not said Maximilian stopping at a short distance I do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for	49.075416564941406
20537/28840	Franz to provoke him and to fight with him all that would be	123.59468841552734

20544/28840	Listen my dear my adored Valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each others	155.28887939453125
20545/28840	I never was romantic and am no melancholy	461.62890625

20549/28840	This is what I shall do I will wait until the very moment you are married for I will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since	56.63814163208008
20550/28840	Franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach itnothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is	279.4388427734375
20551/28840	30333m       Valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her	44.038665771484375
20552/28840	The young man stood before her sorrowful and res	77.37984466552734
20553/28840	Oh for pitys sake said she you will live will you not   No on my honor said Maximilian but that will not affect	26.563508987426758
20554/28840	You have done your duty and your conscience will be at	61.64248275756836
20555/28840	Valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting	77.9831314086914
20556/28840	Maximilian said she Maximilian my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven I entreat you do as I do live in suffering perhaps we may one day be	101.04180145263672

20562/28840	Valentine said he dear Valentine you must not speak thusrather let me	46.6747932434082
20563/28840	Why should I obtain you by violence if our love is mutual Is it from mere humanity you bid me live I would then rather	314.2804260253906

20577/28840	It is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been	40.662479400634766
20578/28840	If we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further	84.88383483886719

20584/28840	My adored Valentine words cannot express one half of my	456.8172302246094
20585/28840	Valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of Morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable	79.65426635742188
20586/28840	Adieu then till we meet again said Valentine tearing herself	393.9137268066406

20588/28840	Thanks thanks dear love adieu   The sound of a kiss was heard and Valentine fled through the	141.74261474609375
20589/28840	Morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also	118.91699981689453
20590/28840	The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any	90.73686218261719
20591/28840	It was only on the following day at about ten oclock in the morning as he was starting to call on	23.136215209960938
20592/28840	Deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from Valentine although he had not before seen her	100.97663879394531

20601/28840	Morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that	88.21907043457031
20602/28840	Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and heard still	51.27177810668945
20603/28840	Franz had been to announce the ceremony and Madame de Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of	66.37181091308594

20606/28840	It is easy to suppose that Morrels agitation would not escape the counts penetrating	81.10111236572266
20607/28840	Monte Cristo was more affectionate than everindeed his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on the point of telling him	83.68028259277344
20608/28840	But he recalled the promise he had made to Valentine and kept his	105.96368408203125
20609/28840	The young man read Valentines letter twenty times in the course of the	74.69828033447266
20610/28840	It was her first and on what an occasion Each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her	159.2658233642578
20611/28840	Morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine say Here I am Maximilian come and help	104.07305145263672
20612/28840	Occasionally he shuddered he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate	95.34771728515625
20613/28840	When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated	173.47756958007812
20614/28840	He shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the	96.88631439208984
20615/28840	Never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on	272.6078186035156
20616/28840	Morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at halfpast	133.81129455566406
20617/28840	He then said It is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oclock but perhaps Valentine will not wait for	62.61974334716797
20618/28840	Consequently Morrel having left the Rue Meslay at halfpast eight by his timepiece entered the cloverfield while the clock of SaintPhilippeduRoule was striking	66.39209747314453
20619/28840	The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where Morrel had often	101.65007019042969
20620/28840	The night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper	258.6274108886719
20621/28840	Then Morrel came out from his hidingplace with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be	43.57706069946289
20622/28840	The clock struck halfpast eight and still another halfhour was passed in waiting while Morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the	114.98322296142578
20623/28840	The garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of	113.32025146484375
20624/28840	The house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriagecontract was going	73.5185546875
20625/28840	Morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking halfpast	132.55006408691406
20626/28840	This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had	94.4160385131836
20627/28840	It was a terrible moment for the young	37.382686614990234
20628/28840	The slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first	62.791282653808594
20629/28840	Amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck	278.7688903808594
20630/28840	It is impossible said Maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interrupt	132.71438598632812
20631/28840	I have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have	213.85012817382812
20632/28840	And then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the	146.45248413085938
20633/28840	Had Valentine fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight These were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young	107.08196258544922
20634/28840	The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his	89.98799896240234
20635/28840	In that case said he I should lose her and by my own	89.44596862792969
20636/28840	He dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared	80.36019134521484
20637/28840	He even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate	68.08111572265625
20638/28840	It was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other	72.81861114501953
20639/28840	He was on Villeforts premiseshad arrived there by scaling the	93.69646453857422
20640/28840	What might be the consequences However he had not ventured thus far to draw	190.06704711914062
20641/28840	He followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of	127.1791000366211
20642/28840	In a moment he had passed through them and could see the house	89.4873046875
20643/28840	30341m       Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not	26.610746383666992
20644/28840	Instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moons feeble	178.52874755859375
20645/28840	A light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second	93.08699798583984
20646/28840	These three windows were in Madame de SaintMérans	28.09663200378418
20647/28840	Another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villeforts	53.158451080322266
20648/28840	So many times in order to follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it	81.74214935302734
20649/28840	This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentines absence had	149.32012939453125
20650/28840	At this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motion	188.3712615966797
20651/28840	If it was Valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible	105.63158416748047
20652/28840	The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in	75.3821792602539
20653/28840	They descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as Doctor dAvrign	32.04931640625
20654/28840	30339m       The young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamoretree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to	42.953155517578125
20655/28840	Who could be dead in that house which Villefort himself had called accursed   My dear	71.60226440429688
20656/28840	de Villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man I have not led you here to console you on the contrary   What can you mean asked the procureur	30.94298553466797
20657/28840	I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still	91.43586730957031
20658/28840	Can it be possible murmured Villefort clasping his	23.60528564453125
20659/28840	What are you going to tell me   Are we quite alone my friend   Yes quite but why all these precautions   Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the	32.37627029418945
20660/28840	The doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his	91.6460952758789
20661/28840	Morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be	192.63873291015625
20662/28840	Dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also	159.14581298828125
20663/28840	Speak doctorI am listening said Villefort strikeI am prepared for everything   Madame de SaintMéran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent	92.69985961914062
20664/28840	Morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten	86.24478149414062
20665/28840	Villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amaz	54.91742706298828
20666/28840	Were you present during the last struggle asked	171.4528045654297
20667/28840	I was replied the procureur you begged me not to	83.1808853149414
20668/28840	Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de SaintMéran has fallen a victim   I	36.724395751953125
20669/28840	Madame de SaintMéran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the	58.94556427001953
20670/28840	Then I understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had	77.81292724609375
20671/28840	This crisis past I endeavored to catch your eye but could	219.14401245117188
20672/28840	You held her handyou were feeling her pulseand the second fit came on before you had turned towards	225.3953094482422
20673/28840	This was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned	189.23020935058594
20674/28840	At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my	82.67525482177734
20675/28840	Yes before others replied the doctor but now we are alone   What are you going to say Oh spare me   That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the	43.64217758178711
20676/28840	de Villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motion	58.53876876831055
20677/28840	Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or	355.5865783691406
20678/28840	Listen said the doctor I know the full importance of the statement I have just made and the disposition of the man to whom I have made	49.22848892211914
20679/28840	Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend asked Ville	31.283676147460938
20680/28840	As a friend and only as a friend at this	69.79644775390625
20681/28840	The similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated I should hesitate I therefore repeat to you I speak not to a magistrate but to a	87.3524169921875
20682/28840	Can it be possible   The symptoms are marked do you seesleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of the brain torpor of the nerve	172.01162719726562
20683/28840	Madame de SaintMéran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to	63.86443328857422
20684/28840	Oh it is impossible said he I must be dreaming It is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you Tell me I entreat you my dear doctor that you may be	35.381011962890625
20685/28840	Doubtless I may but   But   30345m       But I do not think	22.891857147216797
20686/28840	Have pity on me doctor So many dreadful things have happened to me lately that I am on the verge of	105.70227813720703
20687/28840	Has anyone besides me seen Madame de SaintMéran  	35.471580505371094
20688/28840	Has anything been sent for from a chemists that I have not examined  	80.77733612060547
20689/28840	Had Madame de SaintMéran any enemies   Not to my	26.923866271972656
20690/28840	Would her death affect anyones interest   It could not indeed my daughter is her only heiressValentine	133.73117065429688
20691/28840	Oh if such a thought could present itself I would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored	125.5371322631836
20692/28840	dAvrigny I would not accuse anyone I speak only of an accident you understandof a mistakebut whether accident or mistake the fact is there it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to	150.73681640625
20693/28840	Of whomhowof what   May not Barrois the old servant have made a mistake and have given Madame de SaintMéran a dose prepared for his master   For my father  	39.7492561340332
20694/28840	But how could a dose prepared for	214.6244659423828
20695/28840	Noirtier poison Madame de SaintMéran   Nothing is more	25.650257110595703
20696/28840	You know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is	358.02191162109375
20697/28840	For instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to	658.4553833007812
20698/28840	Noirtier I resolved to try one last means and for three months I have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six	80.17059326171875
20699/28840	This quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of	276.3445129394531
20700/28840	Noirtier which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another	84.7970199584961
20701/28840	My dear doctor there is no communication between	155.98477172851562
20702/28840	Noirtiers apartment and that of Madame de SaintMéran and Barrois never entered my motherinlaws	31.122217178344727
20703/28840	In short doctor although I know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although I place the utmost reliance in you I want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom _errare humanum est	156.7152557373047
20704/28840	Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself   Why do you ask me thatwhat do you wish   Send for him I will tell him what I have seen and we will consult together and examine the	50.318050384521484
20705/28840	Let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them rejoice and cover me with	128.3505859375
20706/28840	Pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you a priest I should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know	105.48259735107422
20707/28840	Doctor pray recall your words you have said nothing have you   My dear	104.78731536865234
20708/28840	de Villefort replied the doctor my first duty is to	110.98636627197266
20709/28840	I would have saved Madame de SaintMéran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the	45.48469543457031
20710/28840	Let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts I am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my	125.04496002197266
20711/28840	Meanwhile sir watch alwayswatch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop	604.0810546875
20712/28840	And when you have found the culprit if you find him I will say to you You are a magistrate do as you will   I thank you doctor said Villefort with indescribable joy I never had a better friend than	29.993135452270508
20713/28840	And as if he feared Doctor dAvrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the	57.0944709777832
20714/28840	When they were gone Morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a	53.676971435546875
20715/28840	I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but Valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow   As he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white	108.8487777709961
20716/28840	The light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless Madame de Villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the	105.27446746826172
20717/28840	At the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows	28.13329315185547
20718/28840	A waxlight placed on the mantlepiece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the	136.9633026123047
20719/28840	Morrel shuddered he thought he heard a	67.10709381103516
20720/28840	It cannot be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious	162.98597717285156
20721/28840	Although it was impossible that Valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him	102.0831527709961
20722/28840	Her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards	175.24765014648438
20723/28840	Her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her	534.4685668945312
20724/28840	Meanwhile Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of	90.31913757324219
20725/28840	de Villefort even would not have alarmed	39.909263610839844
20726/28840	He was quite prepared for any such	119.56945037841797
20727/28840	He would at once approach Valentines father and acknowledge all begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving	277.76336669921875
20728/28840	Now especially did he find the description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to	96.42220306396484
20729/28840	He turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in	120.54092407226562
20730/28840	He pushed the door open and	94.92610168457031
20731/28840	At the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly	82.68798828125
20732/28840	By its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easychair was Valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and	81.09662628173828
20733/28840	She had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utter	117.39451599121094
20734/28840	The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole	148.15423583984375
20735/28840	Morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but Valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in	126.8286361694336
20736/28840	He sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chaira head like that of a Magdalen by Correggiowas raised and turned towards	132.0139923095703
20737/28840	Valentine perceived him without betraying the least	99.32229614257812
20738/28840	A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor	326.41650390625
20739/28840	Morrel held out his hand to	59.04951095581055
20740/28840	Valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob	93.7922134399414
20741/28840	Neither dared for some time to speak in that	86.31986999511719
20742/28840	They hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length Valentine	195.34652709960938
20743/28840	My friend said she how came you here Alas I would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this	125.7601318359375
20744/28840	Valentine said Morrel with a trembling voice I had waited since halfpast eight and did not see you come I became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event   What voices asked	76.73074340820312
20745/28840	Morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and	43.36736297607422
20746/28840	de Villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple	107.6369400024414
20747/28840	Your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them I learned it	157.8580322265625
20748/28840	But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here	146.73509216308594
20749/28840	Forgive me replied Morrel I will go	40.59468460083008
20750/28840	No said Valentine you might meet someone	582.0071411132812
20751/28840	But if anyone should come here   The young girl shook her	28.796972274780273
20752/28840	No one will come said she do not fear there is our safeguard pointing to the	83.89759063720703

20754/28840	Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was	205.31942749023438
20755/28840	Alas said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed	99.7190170288086
20756/28840	They both listened steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the	142.29052734375
20757/28840	It is my father who has just left his	34.94072341918945

20759/28840	How do you know it is the doctor asked Valentine	67.96939849853516
20760/28840	I imagined it must be said Mor	42.43412399291992
20761/28840	Valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then	62.318145751953125
20762/28840	de Villefort locked the garden door and returned	76.36824798583984
20763/28840	He stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into Madame de SaintMérans Morrel concealed himself behind a door Valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all	54.23040771484375
20764/28840	de Villefort passed on to his own	29.80901527404785
20765/28840	Now said Valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the	98.75945281982422
20766/28840	There is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfathers	110.55193328857422
20767/28840	Can you mean it Valentine   I have long wished it he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help	197.413818359375
20768/28840	Be careful Valentine said Morrel hesitating to comply with the young girls wishes I now see my errorI acted like a madman in coming in	111.69534301757812
20769/28840	Are you sure you are more reasonable   Yes said Valentine and I have but one scruplethat of leaving my dear grandmothers remains which I had undertaken to	57.758392333984375
20770/28840	Valentine said Morrel death is in itself	116.52082824707031
20771/28840	Yes said Valentine besides it will not be for	74.21461486816406
20772/28840	She then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to	171.07315063476562
20773/28840	Noirtiers room Morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old	33.75480651855469
20774/28840	Barrois said Valentine shut the door and let no one come	141.22691345214844
20775/28840	Noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door he saw Valentine and his eye bright	68.20683288574219
20776/28840	There was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrog	67.89813995361328
20777/28840	said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now I have no friend in the world but	73.40386962890625
20778/28840	His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tender	170.15814208984375
20779/28840	To you alone then may I confide my sorrows and my hopes   The paralytic motioned	99.58060455322266
20780/28840	The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on Mor	78.221923828125
20781/28840	Maximilian Morrel said she the son of that good merchant of Marseilles whom you doubtless recol	60.171913146972656
20782/28840	He brings an irreproachable name which Maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the Legion of	60.856815338134766
20783/28840	The old man signified that he recollected	100.92170715332031
20784/28840	Well grandpapa said Valentine kneeling before him and pointing to Maximilian I love him and will be only his were I compelled to marry another I would destroy	75.1695327758789
20785/28840	The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous	108.50148010253906
20786/28840	Maximilian Morrel do you not grandpapa asked	21.761259078979492
20787/28840	And you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father   Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel as if to say perhaps I	47.814178466796875
20788/28840	Mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmothers room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with	48.154747009277344
20789/28840	Noirtier   That is it said the old mans	18.98554229736328
20790/28840	Do you fear he will not understand  	36.137577056884766
20791/28840	Oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how I talk to	97.81961822509766
20792/28840	Then turning to Maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrowHe knows everything I know said	111.75059509277344
20793/28840	Valentine arose placed a chair for Morrel requested Barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of Morrel she went	89.25083923339844
20794/28840	To prove to Noirtier that he was in Valentines confidence and knew all their secrets Morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a	67.29631042480469
20795/28840	But first said Morrel allow me sir to tell you who I am how much I love Mademoiselle Valentine and what are my designs respecting	49.49836349487305
20796/28840	Noirtier made a sign that he would	18.697744369506836
20797/28840	It was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and	290.3363342285156
20798/28840	His remarkably noble and austere expression struck Morrel who began his story with	367.8951110839844
20799/28840	He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with Valentine and how he had loved her and that Valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his	71.87147521972656
20800/28840	He told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered That is good	135.02609252929688
20801/28840	And now said Morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now I have told you of my love and my hopes may I inform you of my intentions   Yes signified the old	35.0046272277832
20802/28840	This was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sisters house to marry her and to wait respectfully	70.84867095947266
20803/28840	We must not do so  	28.94784927368164
20804/28840	You do not sanction our project  	75.68280029296875
20805/28840	The old mans interrogative eye said Which   I will go continued Maximilian I will seek	69.48101806640625
20806/28840	Franz dÉpinayI am happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villeforts absenceand will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge	50.309242248535156
20807/28840	You wish to know what I will do  	15.812984466552734
20808/28840	I will find him as I told	21.59326171875
20809/28840	Noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful	104.75493621826172
20810/28840	Still when Morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying	80.91326904296875
20811/28840	No said Morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first   I do signified the old	44.34591293334961
20812/28840	But what then must be done asked Mor	60.59779357910156
20813/28840	Madame de SaintMérans last request was that the marriage might not be delayed must I let things take their course Noirtier did not	76.05654907226562
20814/28840	I understand said Morrel I am to	26.921016693115234
20815/28840	But delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young	115.85588073730469
20816/28840	Alone Valentine has no power she will be compelled to	142.1390380859375
20817/28840	I am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur	94.19595336914062
20818/28840	Believe me there are only the two plans I have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you	116.40364837646484
20819/28840	Do you authorize Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor  	37.56821823120117
20820/28840	Do you prefer I should seek	154.45668029785156
20821/28840	Whence then will come the help we needfrom chance resumed Mor	272.8071594238281
20822/28840	You thoroughly understand me sir Pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your	205.2449188232422
20823/28840	Will our help come from you  	82.93981170654297
20824/28840	You are sure of it  	16.2265682220459
20825/28840	There was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his	140.68235778808594
20826/28840	Then I must wait asked the young	33.88442611694336
20827/28840	But the contract The same smile	467.6699523925781
20828/28840	Will you assure me it shall not be signed   Yes said Noirt	25.83350372314453
20829/28840	The contract shall not be signed cried Mor	122.46662139892578
20830/28840	Oh pardon me sir I can scarcely realize so great a	122.9305191040039
20831/28840	Will they not sign it   No said the paraly	47.56832504272461
20832/28840	This promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled	83.53137969970703
20833/28840	Whether Noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at	45.531654357910156
20834/28840	What do you wish sir asked Morrel that I should renew my promise of remaining tranquil Noirtiers eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his	67.25221252441406
20835/28840	Shall I swear to you sir asked Maximil	19.85940170288086
20836/28840	Yes said the paralytic with the same solemn	34.15544891357422
20837/28840	Morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an	188.86231994628906
20838/28840	I swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course I am to pursue with	62.75674057006836
20839/28840	That is right said the old	36.995914459228516
20840/28840	Now said Morrel do you wish me to retire  	14.978151321411133
20841/28840	Without seeing Mademoiselle Valentine  	10.6491060256958
20842/28840	Morrel made a sign that he was ready to	32.571380615234375
20843/28840	But said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just	85.51341247558594
20844/28840	The young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old mans forehead where Valentines had	46.72653579711914
20845/28840	Then he bowed a second time and	104.70919799804688
20846/28840	He found outside the door the old servant to whom Valentine had given	113.41280364990234
20847/28840	He got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay threw himself on his bed and slept sound	109.04447174072266
20848/28840	The Villefort Family Vault   Two days after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten oclock in the morning around the door of	44.887596130371094
20849/28840	de Villeforts house and a long file of mourningcoaches and private carriages extended along the Faubourg SaintHonoré and the Rue de la Pépini	41.129634857177734
20850/28840	Among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a	66.40606689453125
20851/28840	It was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to	90.17449951171875
20852/28840	Inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de SaintMéran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow	95.86331939697266
20853/28840	The Marquis de SaintMéran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XV	28.574548721313477
20854/28840	had preserved a great number of friends and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a claim on formed a considerable	156.53407287597656
20855/28840	Due information was given to the authorities and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same	81.64362335205078
20856/28840	A second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to	422.94281005859375
20857/28840	de Villeforts door and the coffin removed into it from the post	74.19066619873047
20858/28840	The two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of PèreLachaise where	78.69571685791016
20859/28840	de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his	47.90332794189453
20860/28840	The remains of poor Renée were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with	95.69762420654297
20861/28840	The Parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracythe greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their	323.09210205078125
20862/28840	In one of the mourningcoaches Beauchamp Debray and ChâteauRenaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchion	24.70645523071289
20863/28840	How old was she   Franz assured me replied Albert that she was sixtysix years	111.22074127197266
20864/28840	But she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her	109.1678237915039
20865/28840	But of what disease then did she die asked Debr	88.47490692138672
20866/28840	It is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not  	33.140281677246094
20867/28840	It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said Beauch	22.419979095458984
20868/28840	Madame de SaintMéran whom I once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de SaintMé	69.52440643310547
20869/28840	At any rate said Albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her	386.0498352050781
20870/28840	de Villefort or rather Mademoiselle Valentineor still rather our friend Franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting I believe to 80000 livres per ann	64.68926239013672
20871/28840	And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin Noirt	37.2354621887207
20872/28840	That is a tenacious old grandfather said Beauch	107.14698028564453
20873/28840	I think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to	105.99430847167969

20876/28840	Ideas do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep	247.9568328857422
20877/28840	Ideas and men appeared the same to him said	190.1275177001953
20878/28840	One thing only puzzles me namely how Franz dÉpinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his	82.32540893554688
20879/28840	But where is Franz   In the first carriage with	59.285037994384766

20881/28840	40024m       Such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which	105.59391784667969
20882/28840	dAvrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to	63.0391731262207
20883/28840	They arrived in about an hour at the cemetery the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral	167.5087432861328
20884/28840	Among the groups which flocked towards the family vault ChâteauRenaud recognized Morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yewt	74.5638656616211
20885/28840	You here said ChâteauRenaud passing his arms through the young captains are you a friend of Villeforts How is it that I have never met you at his house   I am no acquaintance of	32.2904052734375

20887/28840	Albert came up to them at this moment with	55.16063690185547
20888/28840	The time and place are but illsuited for an	527.6600341796875

20893/28840	Morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to	86.7033462524414
20894/28840	Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said Debray to	18.0366268157959
20895/28840	Extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning I scarcely knew	216.1754913330078

20906/28840	The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance	233.05543518066406

20911/28840	As the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated ChâteauRenaud Albert and Morrel went one way and Debray and Beauchamp the	52.52141571044922
20912/28840	de Villefort at the gate of the cemetery Morrel made an excuse to wait he saw Franz and	54.47892379760742
20913/28840	de Villefort get into the same mourningcoach and thought this meeting forboded	116.19258880615234
20914/28840	He then returned to Paris and although in the same carriage with ChâteauRenaud and Albert he did not hear one word of their	29.68994903564453
20915/28840	As Franz was about to take leave of	48.82622146606445
20916/28840	de Villefort When shall I see you again said the	48.47512435913086

20919/28840	On the contrary I shall feel much	103.29203796386719
20920/28840	Thus the future father and soninlaw stepped into the same carriage and Morrel seeing them pass became	94.24295043945312
20921/28840	Villefort and Franz returned to the Faubourg SaintHonor	7.889178276062012
20922/28840	The procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair  	79.82962799072266
20923/28840	You know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order and her will bequeaths to Valentine the entire property of the SaintMéran family the notary showed me the documents yesterday which will enable us to draw up the contract	70.87725067138672

20926/28840	In that case replied Franz as I shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please I have pledged my word and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to	113.28400421142578
20927/28840	Then said Villefort nothing further is	62.96746063232422
20928/28840	The contract was to have been signed three days since we shall find it all ready and can sign it	118.62057495117188
20929/28840	Dont be uneasy on that score replied Villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my	61.381256103515625
20930/28840	Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of SaintMéran I say hers for she inherits it	38.12727355957031
20931/28840	There after a few days if you like the civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or	146.86607360839844
20932/28840	Madame de SaintMéran wished her daughter should be married	49.8509521484375
20933/28840	When that is over you sir can return to Paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her motherin	89.7216567993164
20934/28840	de Villefort have the kindness to wait half an hour Valentine shall come down into the drawing	42.53301239013672
20935/28840	Deschamps we will read and sign the contract before we separate and this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine to her estate where we will rejoin them in a	79.82430267333984
20936/28840	Sir said Franz I have one request to	51.809940338134766
20937/28840	What is it   I wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de ChâteauRenaud to be present at this signature you know they are my	23.632822036743164
20938/28840	Half an hour will suffice to apprise them will you go for them yourself or shall you send   I prefer going	114.6419906616211
20939/28840	I shall expect you then in half an hour baron and Valentine will be	62.03565979003906
20940/28840	Scarcely had the door closed when	224.98468017578125
20941/28840	de Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawingroom in half an hour as he expected the notary and	34.8832893371582
20942/28840	The news caused a great sensation throughout the house Madame de Villefort would not believe it and Valentine was thunderstru	58.749000549316406
20943/28840	She looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfathers room but on the stairs she met	69.23363494873047
20944/28840	de Villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawing	21.3123836517334
20945/28840	In the anteroom Valentine met Barrois and looked despairingly at the old	92.4344482421875
20946/28840	A moment later Madame de Villefort entered the drawingroom with her little	37.70557403564453
20947/28840	It was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatig	54.00520324707031
20948/28840	She sat down took Edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her bos	77.88958740234375
20949/28840	Two carriages were soon heard to enter the	121.25067901611328
20950/28840	One was the notarys the other that of Franz and his	62.880958557128906
20951/28840	In a moment the whole party was	116.65931701660156
20952/28840	Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her	77.91511535644531
20953/28840	ChâteauRenaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to	36.996910095214844
20954/28840	Madame de Villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her	77.5921401977539
20955/28840	The notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards Franz   Are you	95.37914276123047
20956/28840	Franz de Quesnel baron dÉpinay asked he although he knew it	64.44097137451172
20957/28840	I have then to inform you sir at the request of	61.108116149902344
20958/28840	de Villefort that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed the feeling of	20.606300354003906
20959/28840	Noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left	65.49769592285156
20960/28840	Let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and	124.75218963623047
20961/28840	dÉpinay that during my lifetime my fathers will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be	124.31572723388672
20962/28840	40032m       Sir said Franz I regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine I have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds	38.76288986206055
20963/28840	My family has sought consideration in this alliance with	397.80841064453125
20964/28840	de Villefort all I seek is	185.4857635498047
20965/28840	Valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her	82.56171417236328
20966/28840	Besides sir said Villefort addressing himself to his future soninlaw excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you	76.34429168701172
20967/28840	Noirtiers weakness of mind sufficiently explains	388.6632385253906
20968/28840	It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same	51.117828369140625
20969/28840	Old age is selfish sir and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to	31.132829666137695
20970/28840	Noirtier which she cannot be when she becomes the Baroness dÉpin	42.96584701538086
20971/28840	My fathers melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married	103.03270721435547
20972/28840	Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended	114.33055114746094
20973/28840	de Villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and Barrois	32.97626495361328
20974/28840	Gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstancesgentlemen	402.94873046875
20975/28840	Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to	37.04381561279297
20976/28840	He as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom	46.2046012878418
20977/28840	Villefort started Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees Valentine rose pale and dumb as a	77.37728881835938
20978/28840	Albert and ChâteauRenaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the	19.478160858154297
20979/28840	dÉpinay cannot leave the drawingroom at	57.3332405090332
20980/28840	It is at this moment replied Barrois with the same firmness that	29.84990882873535
20981/28840	Noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to	152.54412841796875
20982/28840	Grandpapa Noirtier can speak now then said Edward with his habitual quick	124.9151611328125
20983/28840	However his remark did not make Madame de Villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the	119.83909606933594
20984/28840	Nortier resumed Villefort that what he demands is	303.5916442871094
20985/28840	Nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied Barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing	107.55341339111328
20986/28840	Something like a smile was perceptible on Madame de Villeforts count	35.619197845458984
20987/28840	Valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank	83.96158599853516
20988/28840	de Villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfathers	82.8887710571289
20989/28840	Valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when	78.66468811035156
20990/28840	Stop said he I will go with	25.664466857910156
20991/28840	Excuse me sir said Franz since	135.58766174316406
20992/28840	Noirtier sent for me I am ready to attend to his wish besides I shall be happy to pay my respects to him not having yet had the honor of doing	41.14628982543945
20993/28840	Pray sir said Villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb	46.02090072631836
20994/28840	40032m       Forgive me sir said Franz in a resolute	35.93955993652344
20995/28840	I would not lose this opportunity of proving to	89.57200622558594
20996/28840	Noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which I am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my	111.06689453125
20997/28840	And without listening to Villefort he arose and followed Valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling	65.45597839355469
20998/28840	ChâteauRenaud and Morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing	51.889923095703125
20999/28840	A Signed Statement   Noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his arm	56.06711196899414
21000/28840	When the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately	97.21826934814453
21001/28840	Listen whispered Villefort to Valentine who could not conceal her joy if	80.7059555053711
21002/28840	Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage I forbid you to understand	124.47676849365234
21003/28840	Franz dÉpinay said he you requested to see	42.02300262451172
21004/28840	We have all wished for this interview and I trust it will convince you how illformed are your objections to Valentines	171.39100646972656
21005/28840	Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villeforts blood run	92.20906066894531
21006/28840	In a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a	74.01949310302734
21007/28840	Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the	58.27457809448242
21008/28840	She opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless	94.69119262695312
21009/28840	Shall I open the secretaire asked	181.0992431640625
21010/28840	Those at the side  	26.73862075805664
21011/28840	Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of	40.26521682739258
21012/28840	Is that what you wish for asked	84.89059448242188
21013/28840	She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was	221.9376983642578
21014/28840	But there are no more said	59.39564514160156
21015/28840	Noirtiers eye was fixed on the	35.43951416015625
21016/28840	Yes I understand grandfather said the young	58.148895263671875
21017/28840	40036m       She pointed to each letter of the	63.309505462646484
21018/28840	At the letter S the old man stopped	147.35316467285156
21019/28840	She opened and found the word	326.34722900390625
21020/28840	Ah is there a secret spring said	129.86563110351562
21021/28840	And who knows it Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone	31.89667320251465
21022/28840	Shall I call him  	36.70612716674805
21023/28840	Valentine went to the door and called Barro	20.140703201293945
21024/28840	Villeforts impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and Franz was stupef	52.169189453125
21025/28840	Barrois said Valentine my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a secret spring in it which you knowwill you open it   Barrois looked at the old	61.294593811035156
21026/28840	Barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black	258.04022216796875
21027/28840	Is that what you wish for said Barro	30.812021255493164
21028/28840	Shall I give these papers to	218.58450317382812
21029/28840	Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover read   To be given after my death to General Durand who shall bequeath the packet to his son with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important	95.07286834716797
21030/28840	Well sir asked Franz what do you wish me to do with this paper   To preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procure	35.50539779663086
21031/28840	Do you wish him to read it said	60.5848503112793
21032/28840	You understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said	146.3416290283203
21033/28840	Then let us sit down said Villefort impatiently for it will take some	30.357656478881836
21034/28840	Villefort took a chair but Valentine remained standing by her fathers side and Franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his	93.56275177001953
21035/28840	February 5th 1815 said he it is the day my father was	53.423179626464844
21036/28840	Valentine and Villefort were dumb the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly Go	45.931060791015625
21037/28840	But it was on leaving this club said he my father	116.81634521484375
21038/28840	had just granted to him with his estate of Épin	157.28533935546875
21039/28840	400340m       A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel begging him to be present at the meeting next day the 5	59.01499938964844
21040/28840	The note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o	88.48304748535156
21041/28840	The meetings were always held from that time till	969.4126586914062
21042/28840	General de Quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they	134.0099334716797
21043/28840	The generals carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he	118.46931457519531
21044/28840	What must be done then asked the	64.84114074707031
21045/28840	I have my carriage here said the	68.41284942626953
21046/28840	Have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know   Our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a StateCouncill	41.99965286254883
21047/28840	Then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being	149.07057189941406
21048/28840	We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came	97.99665069580078
21049/28840	When they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no	74.18641662597656
21050/28840	On the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his	75.24064636230469
21051/28840	The carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue SaintJac	40.00801086425781
21052/28840	The general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly	89.58049774169922
21053/28840	The members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in	67.99987030029297
21054/28840	When in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many wellknown faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been	83.14579010009766
21055/28840	And hence said Villefort arose my affection for your father my dear	65.99333190917969
21056/28840	Opinions held in common are a ready bond of	753.6812133789062
21057/28840	Franz continued   The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but	132.0857696533203
21058/28840	de Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with	60.793643951416016
21059/28840	He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of Elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their	26.137367248535156
21060/28840	One paragraph spoke of the return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the _Pharaon_ belonging to the shipbuilder Morrel of Marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the	47.47933578491211
21061/28840	During all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repug	143.09156799316406
21062/28840	When the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brow	222.55076599121094
21063/28840	Well asked the president what do you say to this letter general   I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XV	54.2110595703125
21064/28840	to break my vow in behalf of the exem	283.9421081542969
21065/28840	This answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his	216.99147033691406
21066/28840	General said the president we acknowledge no King Louis XV	54.579471588134766

21068/28840	Excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge Louis XV	82.53837585449219
21069/28840	but I do as he has made me a baron and a fieldmarshal and I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his happy return to	50.344566345214844

21071/28840	We will not constrain you to help us we enroll no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do	73.90987396240234
21072/28840	You would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what I should call becoming your accompl	148.24093627929688
21073/28840	You see I am more candid than	127.56605529785156
21074/28840	Ah my father said Franz interrupting	77.88992309570312
21075/28840	I understand now why they murdered	198.1271514892578
21076/28840	Valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to	101.25328826904297
21077/28840	Villefort walked to and fro behind	98.04871368408203
21078/28840	Noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding	138.57217407226562
21079/28840	Franz returned to the manuscript and continued   Sir said the president you have been invited to join this assemblyyou were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfoldedyou	85.78648376464844
21080/28840	When you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XV	91.55157470703125
21081/28840	or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the	48.8780632019043
21082/28840	It would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in	57.25636291503906
21083/28840	No no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the	139.22149658203125
21084/28840	I am a royalist replied the general I have taken the oath of allegiance to Louis XV	51.673255920410156
21085/28840	These words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rash	60.82545471191406
21086/28840	The president again arose and having imposed silence saidSir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer	124.86031341552734
21087/28840	The general putting his hand on his sword exclaimedIf you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by	228.1023406982422
21088/28840	And you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the generals anger I advise you not to touch your	65.88102722167969

21090/28840	Then you must die replied the president	96.45016479492188

21092/28840	A significant silence followed these words and as the general did not replyClose the doors said the president to the door	88.43934631347656
21093/28840	40042m       The same deadly silence succeeded these	65.49032592773438
21094/28840	Then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelingsI have a son said he and I ought to think of him finding myself among	103.01143646240234
21095/28840	General said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fiftyit is the privilege of	125.68038940429688

21097/28840	Follow my advice swear and do not	295.43389892578125
21098/28840	The general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the presidents deskWhat is the form said	194.63143920898438
21099/28840	It is thisI swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what I have seen and heard on the 5th of February 1815 between nine and ten oclock in the evening and I plead guilty of death should I ever violate this	55.60886001586914
21100/28840	Now am I at liberty to retire said the	100.33511352539062
21101/28840	The president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his	188.83261108398438
21102/28840	One of those three members was the coachman who had driven them	51.40211868286133
21103/28840	Where do you wish to be taken asked the	36.33858871459961
21104/28840	Anywhere out of your presence replied	149.337158203125
21105/28840	Beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals do not insult them unless you wish to be held	70.28528594970703
21106/28840	dÉpinay went onYou are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against	97.21646118164062
21107/28840	They were at that part of the Quai des Ormes where the steps lead down to the	104.960693359375
21108/28840	Why do you stop here asked dÉpin	48.062503814697266
21109/28840	Because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable rep	109.97808837890625
21110/28840	Another method of assassination said the general shrugging his	34.10763168334961
21111/28840	Make no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a	77.79586791992188
21112/28840	You are alone one alone shall answer you you have a sword by your side I have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve	95.57942199707031
21113/28840	Now if you please remove your band	134.20657348632812
21114/28840	The general tore the handkerchief from his	59.71384048461914
21115/28840	At last said he I shall know with whom I have to	51.3376350402832
21116/28840	They opened the door and the four men alight	24.76240348815918
21117/28840	Franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his fathers death which had hitherto been a	156.14566040039062
21118/28840	Valentine clasped her hands as if in	35.45341873168945
21119/28840	Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and	37.595916748046875
21120/28840	Franz continued   It was as we said the fifth of	98.29335021972656
21121/28840	For three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with	84.4491195678711
21122/28840	The general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting	175.98414611816406
21123/28840	The ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and	109.65159606933594
21124/28840	One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coalbarge near and by its light they examined the	195.52806091308594
21125/28840	The presidents sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the generals and had no	161.73411560058594
21126/28840	The general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own	120.88785552978516
21127/28840	The witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be	167.37318420410156
21128/28840	The lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel	104.42916870117188
21129/28840	The light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so	109.52263641357422
21130/28840	40044m       General dÉpinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and	50.94426727294922
21131/28840	The witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to	88.58509063720703
21132/28840	The circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his	235.33218383789062
21133/28840	But his opponent did not allow his guard to be	103.06312561035156
21134/28840	He received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the	99.63545989990234
21135/28840	They thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with	98.77216339111328
21136/28840	The general who had almost fainted	274.4631652832031
21137/28840	Ah said he they have sent some fencingmaster to fight with	96.97293090820312
21138/28840	The president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third	116.33589935302734
21139/28840	Still he had not even uttered a	60.67108917236328
21140/28840	He had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the waterit was the generals body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was	61.16233825683594
21141/28840	The general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been	128.8051300048828
21142/28840	In proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of	102.88394927978516
21143/28840	Villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door Valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfathers answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few	107.63056945800781
21144/28840	Mademoiselle said Franz turning towards Valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of	45.869972229003906
21145/28840	Hold sir said Villefort do not prolong this dreadful	39.91184616088867
21146/28840	The names have been purposely concealed my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he cannot tell you proper names are not in the	209.5199737548828
21147/28840	Oh mademoiselle mademoiselle cried Franz your grandfather says he can indicate the	58.900299072265625
21148/28840	Help melend me your assistance   Noirtier looked at the	66.32083892822266
21149/28840	Franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to	74.92990112304688
21150/28840	At that letter the old man signified	127.45125579833984
21151/28840	The young mans finger glided over the words but at each one Noirtier answered by a negative	156.39059448242188
21152/28840	Valentine hid her head between her	62.386470794677734
21153/28840	At length Franz arrived at the word MYS	187.4815216064453

21157/28840	Progress of Cavalcanti the Younger   Meanwhile	86.7214584350586
21158/28840	Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria but at the gamingtable of the baths of Lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous court	81.05924224853516
21159/28840	He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of	137.6190643310547
21160/28840	Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the Marchioness Oliva Corsin	44.66875076293945
21161/28840	He was now fairly launched in that Parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be	149.54501342773438
21162/28840	Besides what is required of a young man in Paris To speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in	98.58560180664062
21163/28840	They are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a	249.83462524414062
21164/28840	Andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair	455.7817687988281

21166/28840	A learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of	232.6290740966797
21167/28840	Such was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before our readers when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay	69.4198226928711
21168/28840	Danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the	35.50788879394531
21169/28840	It was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at Auteuil and the events which followed it that Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristos name	52.62428283691406
21170/28840	If he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars soon dispelled every impression of	120.36959075927734
21171/28840	It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested enduseless injury is repugnant to every	272.8187255859375
21172/28840	40048m       When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with	36.40998077392578
21173/28840	Cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his	106.09732055664062
21174/28840	The latter took in the whole scene at a	171.60772705078125
21175/28840	The baroness was partially reclining on a sofa Eugénie sat near her and Cavalcanti was	47.17940139770508
21176/28840	This movement was accompanied by killing glances at Mademoiselle Danglars and by sighs launched in the same	41.895442962646484
21177/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars was still the samecold beautiful and	15.358319282531738
21178/28840	Not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of Minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of Sapp	161.93275451660156
21179/28840	Cavalcanti the company of Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly her singing	61.83082580566406
21180/28840	It was then especially while conversing with Madame Danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed	63.799476623535156
21181/28840	Andrea Cavalcantis solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his	182.74327087402344
21182/28840	His first look was certainly directed towards Monte Cristo but the second was for	149.628173828125
21183/28840	As for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal	136.354736328125
21184/28840	Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said Danglars to	51.03960418701172
21185/28840	Alas no sir replied Andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former	89.23981475830078
21186/28840	Danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened	21.243444442749023
21187/28840	40050m       The two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admir	63.68227767944336
21188/28840	Mademoiselle dArmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with Eugénie one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the Germans are so	56.07390213012695
21189/28840	She was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formeda little fairylike figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as Perugino sometimes makes his Virgins and her eyes dull from	185.11422729492188
21190/28840	She was said to have a weak chest and like Antonia in the _Cremona Violin_ she would die one day while	193.49600219726562
21191/28840	Monte Cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen Mademoiselle dArmilly of whom he had heard	62.146121978759766
21192/28840	The count soon heard Andreas voice singing a Corsican song accompanied by the	379.9461975097656
21193/28840	The praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the barons countenance would not have led him to suspect	74.35388946533203
21194/28840	Hem thought Monte Cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boasted of	187.85414123535156
21195/28840	Danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the Bourse what he loses	51.50559616088867
21196/28840	I see that you participate in a prevalent error said Madame Dangl	36.39856719970703
21197/28840	Debray told meapropos what has become of him I have seen nothing of him the last three or four	42.5833854675293

21200/28840	I was once very fond of it but I do not indulge	57.57786560058594

21203/28840	Madame Danglars blushed in spite of all her	19.056081771850586

21216/28840	You may well say perchance replied the banker for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings	122.34392547607422
21217/28840	But should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be disple	68.04761505126953
21218/28840	Albert would not do us the honor to be jealous he does not like Eugénie	62.883121490478516
21219/28840	Besides I care not for his	193.44020080566406
21220/28840	Still situated as we are   Yes do you know how we are situated At his mothers ball he danced once with Eugénie and	82.30523681640625
21221/28840	Cavalcanti three times and he took no notice of	157.9363250732422
21222/28840	The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcer	18.33317756652832
21223/28840	The baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when Danglars stopped	53.56284713745117
21224/28840	Monte Cristo appeared to be unconscious of what	284.5199890136719
21225/28840	Albert entered looking very handsome and in high	206.30215454101562
21226/28840	He bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to Danglars and affectionately to Monte Crist	33.131717681884766
21227/28840	Then turning to the baroness May I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is said	17.38529396057129
21228/28840	She is quite well replied Danglars quickly she is at the piano with	40.24749755859375
21229/28840	Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew Monte Cristos eye was on	145.82644653320312
21230/28840	Cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and Mademoiselle Eugénie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like Thal	134.4390106201172
21231/28840	The concert must be a delightful	273.1996154785156
21232/28840	They suit each other remarkably well said Dangl	29.145753860473633
21233/28840	Albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that Madame Danglars bl	57.33143615722656
21234/28840	I too said the young man am a musicianat least my masters used to tell me so but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than	84.1941146850586
21235/28840	Danglars smiled and seemed to say It is of no	34.41719436645508
21236/28840	Then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he saidThe prince and my daughter were universally admired	342.2101135253906
21237/28840	You were not of the party	119.46253967285156
21238/28840	de Morcerf   What prince asked	51.757232666015625
21239/28840	Prince Cavalcanti said Danglars who persisted in giving the young man that	26.23659324645996
21240/28840	Pardon me said Albert I was not aware that he was a	39.13353729248047
21241/28840	And Prince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle Eugénie yesterday It must have been charming	38.7607536315918
21242/28840	But I was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a German concert given by the Baroness of ChâteauRen	56.46897506713867
21243/28840	This was followed by rather an awkward	289.8977966308594
21244/28840	Bravo bravi brava The banker was enthusiastic in his	817.7555541992188
21245/28840	40054m       Indeed said Albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti	47.01028060913086
21246/28840	You said prince did you not But he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in	103.18453216552734
21247/28840	But to return to the charming musiciansyou should give us a treat Danglars without telling them there is a	57.38534164428711
21248/28840	Ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by	140.72764587402344
21249/28840	Danglars was quite annoyed by the young mans	41.01820373535156
21250/28840	What do you think of our lover said	45.19398880004883
21251/28840	Yes doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does	50.12407302856445
21252/28840	See him there cold as marble and proud like his	363.0798645019531
21253/28840	If he were rich if he had Cavalcantis fortune that might be pard	59.892608642578125
21254/28840	Why do you doubt   The pastthat obscurity on the	151.17828369140625
21255/28840	But that does not affect the	86.92697143554688
21256/28840	Now I beg of you dont go off your	62.4384651184082
21257/28840	Its a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young Cavalcanti whom I do not really know at	51.74089813232422
21258/28840	Have you made inquiry   Is there any need of that Does not his appearance speak for him And he is very	112.71619415283203
21259/28840	I am not so sure of	31.071788787841797
21260/28840	And yet you said he had	269.572021484375
21261/28840	Hem said Monte Cristo in his	36.78723907470703
21262/28840	Come count you do not do that young man	102.197509765625
21263/28840	Well I acknowledge it annoys me knowing your connection with the Morcerf family to see him throw himself in the	133.5391082763672
21264/28840	What a Puritan you are said he that happens every	90.36859130859375
21265/28840	But you cannot break it off in this way the Morcerfs are depending on this	94.86930084228516
21266/28840	Then let them explain themselves you should give the father a hint you are so intimate with the	143.75186157226562
21267/28840	Iwhere the devil did you find out that   At their ball it was apparent	101.43896484375
21268/28840	But let it be done explicitly and	116.0505599975586
21269/28840	If he demands my daughter let him fix the daydeclare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or	203.4977264404297
21270/28840	Yes sir I will give my attention to the	45.94654846191406
21271/28840	I do not say that I await with pleasure his decision but I do await	71.67028045654297
21272/28840	A banker must you know be a slave to his	245.13406372070312
21273/28840	Cavalcanti had done half an hour	213.8004608154297
21274/28840	Bravi bravo brava cried Morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an	279.73638916015625
21275/28840	Danglars began to look suspiciously at Morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to	35.63337707519531
21276/28840	I shall soon return said the banker to Monte Cristo wait for	39.501380920410156
21277/28840	I shall perhaps have something to say to	42.50998306274414
21278/28840	The baroness took advantage of her husbands absence to push open the door of her daughters study and	62.74225997924805
21279/28840	Andrea who was sitting before the piano with Mademoiselle Eugénie started up like a jackinthe	68.79814910888672
21280/28840	Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual cool	22.41834259033203
21281/28840	Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to Morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look	124.5948257446289
21282/28840	Then Albert launched out in praise of Mademoiselle Danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous	37.97114562988281
21283/28840	Cavalcanti being left alone turned to Monte Crist	226.1416778564453
21284/28840	Come said Madame Danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take	45.85154724121094
21285/28840	Come Louise said Mademoiselle Danglars to her	16.59791374206543
21286/28840	They passed into the next drawingroom where tea was	151.40444946289062
21287/28840	Just as they were beginning in the English fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and Danglars entered visibly	59.95258331298828
21288/28840	Monte Cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an	253.7362823486328
21289/28840	I have just received my courier from Greece said Dangl	30.57020378112793
21290/28840	Ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from	84.4000015258789
21291/28840	How is King Otho getting on asked Albert in the most sprightly	255.18125915527344
21292/28840	Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a	55.74016189575195
21293/28840	We shall go together shall we not said Albert to the	77.53662872314453
21294/28840	I shall compliment Mademoiselle Danglars on her cameo while the father talks to	31.91661262512207
21295/28840	If you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said Monte Crist	69.64082336425781
21296/28840	My dear viscount you are dreadfully impert	40.25741195678711
21297/28840	Meanwhile Danglars stooping to Monte Cristos ear Your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the names Fernand and Yan	90.38229370117188
21298/28840	Yes I will tell you all but take away the young man I cannot endure his	44.78419494628906
21299/28840	Shall I send the father to you  	77.01864624023438
21300/28840	Haydée   Scarcely had the counts horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when Albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughtermuch too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and	72.58349609375
21301/28840	Well said he I will ask you the same question which Charles	42.24355697631836
21302/28840	put to Catherine de Medici after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew How have I played my little part   To what do you allude asked Monte Crist	70.92858123779297
21303/28840	To the installation of my rival at	188.00218200683594
21304/28840	What rival   _Ma foi_ what rival Why your protégé	174.39378356933594
21305/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti   Ah no joking viscount if you please I do not patronize	60.21869659423828
21306/28840	And you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with	107.48143768310547
21307/28840	What do you think he is paying his addresses   I am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his	50.873130798339844
21308/28840	He aspires to the hand of the proud Eugé	69.17892456054688
21309/28840	What does that signify so long as they favor your suit   But it is not the case my dear count on the	50.65684509277344
21310/28840	What   It is so indeed Mademoiselle Eugénie scarcely answers me and Mademoiselle dArmilly her confidant does not speak to me at	20.532468795776367
21311/28840	But the father has the greatest regard possible for you said Monte Crist	74.54278564453125
21312/28840	He Oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedyweapons I own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and	154.68154907226562
21313/28840	Of whomof Debray   No of	49.04732131958008
21314/28840	Of me I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against	88.72373962402344
21315/28840	Do you wish me to do so  	11.480597496032715
21316/28840	Well I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the Comte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the bar	27.02552604675293
21317/28840	By whom are you charged   By the baron	66.21334838867188
21318/28840	Oh said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was	49.777530670166016
21319/28840	You surely will not do that my dear count   Certainly I shall Albert as I have promised to do	43.784793853759766
21320/28840	Well said Albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry	49.08818435668945
21321/28840	I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said Monte Crist	31.582202911376953
21322/28840	But apropos of Debray how is it that I have not seen him lately at the barons house   There has been a	30.810712814331055
21323/28840	What with the baroness   No with the bar	16.5024356842041
21324/28840	Has he perceived anything   Ah that is a good joke   Do you think he suspects said Monte Cristo with charming art	37.07956314086914
21325/28840	Where have you come from my dear count said	31.278276443481445
21326/28840	It must be farther off than even	192.48915100097656
21327/28840	But what do I know of your Parisian husbands   Oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole	103.79536437988281
21328/28840	But then what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and Debray They seemed to understand each other so well said Monte Cristo with renewed	38.085140228271484
21329/28840	Ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis in which I am not	60.526180267333984
21330/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that	84.52964782714844
21331/28840	Here we are said Monte Cristo it is only halfpast ten oclock come	19.595340728759766
21332/28840	No thank you I gave orders for my _coupé_ to follow	38.11941146850586
21333/28840	There it is then said Monte Cristo as he stepped out of the	25.43988800048828
21334/28840	They both went into the house the drawingroom was lighted upthey went in	105.90998840332031
21335/28840	You will make tea for us Baptistin said the	70.45198822021484
21336/28840	Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy	152.892578125
21337/28840	What you say is perhaps true they know my	233.8625030517578
21338/28840	For instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during teatime   _Ma foi_ I should like to	59.45679473876953
21339/28840	Monte Cristo took the gong and struck it	218.6796875
21340/28840	In about the space of a second a private door opened and Ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent lat	80.62356567382812
21341/28840	Oh no it is as simple as possible replied Monte Crist	34.19601058959961
21342/28840	Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that youAh but what do I hear and Morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a	82.51118469238281
21343/28840	_Ma foi_ my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening you have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars piano to be attacked by Haydées guz	34.960121154785156
21344/28840	Haydéewhat an adorable name Are there then really women who bear the name of Haydée anywhere but in Byrons poems   Certainly there	141.24610900878906
21345/28840	Haydée is a very uncommon name in France but is common enough in Albania and Epirus it is as if you said for example Chastity Modesty Innocenceit is a kind of baptismal name as you Parisians call	100.73982238769531
21346/28840	And you think she would be angry   No certainly not said the count with a haughty	26.84776496887207
21347/28840	She is very amiable then is she not said	105.0903549194336
21348/28840	It is not to be called amiability it is her duty a slave does not dictate to a	95.1127700805664
21349/28840	Are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name   Und	103.19761657714844
21350/28840	Really count you do nothing and have nothing like other	146.48516845703125
21351/28840	The slave of the Count of Monte Cristo Why it is a rank of itself in France and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a	33.9617919921875
21352/28840	A hundred thousand francs The poor girl originally possessed much more than that she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the _Thousand and One Nights_ would seem but	63.17787170410156
21353/28840	You are right and she is one of the greatest in her country	82.04740142822266
21354/28840	You know the history of the Pasha of Yanina do you not   Of Ali Tepelini13 Oh yes it was in his service that my father made his	28.313079833984375
21355/28840	40062m       Well what is Haydée to Ali Tepelini   Merely his	18.837650299072266
21356/28840	What the daughter of Ali Pasha   Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasil	33.248050689697266
21357/28840	And your slave   _Ma foi_	17.821569442749023
21358/28840	But how did she become so   Why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as I was passing through the market at	88.49140167236328
21359/28840	Wonderful Really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when I listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking	129.7490234375
21360/28840	Now I am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but   Say	56.88690948486328
21361/28840	But since you go out with Haydée and sometimes even take her to the Opera   Well   I think I may venture to ask you this	39.38532257080078
21362/28840	You may venture to ask me	78.666748046875
21363/28840	Well then my dear count present me to your	177.74082946777344
21364/28840	I will do so but on two	105.56612396240234
21365/28840	The first is that you will never tell anyone that I have granted the	72.21414184570312
21366/28840	Very well said Albert extending his hand I swear I will	39.92344665527344
21367/28840	The second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served	140.9416046142578
21368/28840	I give you my oath that I will	39.595237731933594
21369/28840	Enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not But I know you to be a man of	48.68596267700195
21370/28840	Tell Haydée said he that I will take coffee with her and give her to understand that I desire permission to present one of my friends to	49.107208251953125
21371/28840	Now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear Morcerf if you wish to know anything tell me and I will ask	48.542057037353516
21372/28840	Ali reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door to signify to his master and Albert that they were at liberty to pass	53.9720458984375
21373/28840	Let us go in said Monte Crist	30.78396987915039
21374/28840	Albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and	67.89933013916016
21375/28840	Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three French attendants commanded by Myrth	118.44434356689453
21376/28840	Haydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawing	64.95758819580078
21377/28840	Her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except Monte Cristo had been accorded an entrance into her	64.51958465576172
21378/28840	She was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the Eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped	88.23177337646484
21379/28840	Near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its	101.06517028808594
21380/28840	On perceiving Monte Cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest	61.05265808105469
21381/28840	Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her	113.91419982910156
21382/28840	Whom do you bring asked the young girl in Romaic of Monte Cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an	69.45848846435547
21383/28840	A friend said Monte Cristo in the same	18.151819229125977
21384/28840	What is his name   Count Albert it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the banditti at	31.969512939453125
21385/28840	In what language would you like me to converse with him   Monte Cristo turned to	35.746944427490234
21386/28840	Do you know modern Greek asked	270.1142578125
21387/28840	Alas no said Albert nor even ancient Greek my dear count never had Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than	235.8621063232422
21388/28840	Then said Haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood Monte Cristos question and Alberts answer then I will speak either in French or Italian if my lord so wills	100.37506866455078
21389/28840	You will speak in Italian said	128.7568817138672
21390/28840	The count made a sign to Haydée to address his	46.01523971557617
21391/28840	Sir she said to Morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and	34.23276901245117
21392/28840	This was said in excellent Tuscan and with that soft Roman accent which makes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of	124.50823211669922
21393/28840	Then turning to Ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to	75.58853149414062
21394/28840	Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of	117.1800308227539
21395/28840	Ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to	85.62934112548828
21396/28840	Baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to	454.9742126464844
21397/28840	Albert refused the pipe which the Nubian offered	93.64323425292969
21398/28840	Oh take ittake it said the count Haydée is almost as civilized as a Parisian the smell of a Havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the East is a most delicious perfume you	71.87682342529297
21399/28840	The cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for	186.07699584960938
21400/28840	Monte Cristo and Haydée took the beverage in the original Arabian manner that is to say without	127.5271224975586
21401/28840	Haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it	147.25875854492188
21402/28840	At this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that	201.59786987304688
21403/28840	My dear host and you signora said Albert in Italian excuse my apparent	196.0170440673828
21404/28840	I am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be	24.29122543334961
21405/28840	Oh signora if I could but speak Greek your conversation added to the fairyscene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to	139.11380004882812
21406/28840	I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you sir said Haydée quietly and if you like what is Eastern I will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are	71.00993347167969
21407/28840	On what subject shall I converse with her said Albert in a low tone to Monte Crist	38.70979309082031
21408/28840	Just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of Rome Naples or	91.96886444091797
21409/28840	Oh said Albert it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if one converses just in the same style as with a Parisian let me speak to her of the	87.25720977783203
21410/28840	Do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her	80.80989837646484
21411/28840	At what age did you leave Greece signora asked	229.1719512939453
21412/28840	I left it when I was but five years old replied Hayd	40.698219299316406
21413/28840	And have you any recollection of your country   When I shut my eyes and think I seem to see it all	62.29396438598633
21414/28840	The mind can see as well as the	121.65850830078125
21415/28840	The body forgets sometimes but the mind always	683.6390380859375
21416/28840	Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the	88.85706329345703
21417/28840	And how old were you at that time   I was three years old said Hayd	44.39971923828125
21418/28840	Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old said	87.93892669677734
21419/28840	Count said Albert in a low tone to Monte Cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her	46.787479400634766
21420/28840	You prohibited my mentioning my fathers name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful	83.18485260009766
21421/28840	Haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful	145.3650360107422
21422/28840	What are you saying to her said Morcerf in an undert	21.10872459411621
21423/28840	I again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from	102.21851348876953
21424/28840	Then from time to time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which I paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either Kill or P	85.93739318847656
21425/28840	It is very strange said Albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to ones self This is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe	106.97258758544922
21426/28840	Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes I have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest	83.11582946777344
21427/28840	40068m       Speak speak signora said Albert I am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you	47.651947021484375
21428/28840	Haydée answered his remark with a melancholy	81.09059143066406
21429/28840	You wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said	80.25255584716797
21430/28840	I beg you to do so replied	31.34613609313965
21431/28840	Well I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened by my	105.60071563720703
21432/28840	We were in the palace of Yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which I was sleeping and on opening my eyes I saw hers filled with	82.48109436035156
21433/28840	When I saw her weeping I began to cry	209.6335906982422
21434/28840	I saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mothers servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest	129.75718688964844
21435/28840	Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed since they have again become a	199.8439483642578
21436/28840	Here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pinetorches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof	179.1034393310547
21437/28840	Quick said a voice at the end of the	22.926380157470703
21438/28840	This voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obe	480.42413330078125
21439/28840	As for me it made me trem	94.30448913574219
21440/28840	This voice was that of my	106.5679931640625
21441/28840	He came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented	151.37974548339844
21442/28840	He was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite Selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling	131.30056762695312
21443/28840	My father said Haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and before whom Turkey tremb	33.023956298828125
21444/28840	Soon said Haydée we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a	60.393592834472656
21445/28840	My mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces I saw my father who was glancing anxiously	72.57121276855469
21446/28840	Four marble steps led down to the waters edge and below them was a boat floating on the	190.43020629882812
21447/28840	40070m       From where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were	59.960933685302734
21448/28840	This kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discern	101.56794738769531
21449/28840	I remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when I leaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our Palik	77.90979766845703
21450/28840	14 Besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother Selim and	258.13323974609375
21451/28840	The Palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of	81.38212585449219
21452/28840	Why does the boat go so fast asked I of my	270.14129638671875
21453/28840	Silence child Hush we are flying I did not	290.9645690917969
21454/28840	Why should my father flyhe the allpowerfulhe before whom others were accustomed to flyhe who had taken for his device   They hate me then they fear me     It was indeed a flight which my father was trying to	117.8781967163086
21455/28840	I have been told since that the garrison of the castle of Yanina fatigued with long service   Here Haydée cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her	35.80911636352539
21456/28840	The young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is	194.7909393310547
21457/28840	And this officer asked Albert do you remember his name signora   Monte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by	39.074745178222656
21458/28840	No said she I do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently I will tell	35.59341812133789
21459/28840	Albert was on the point of pronouncing his fathers name when Monte Cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was	40.068992614746094
21460/28840	It was towards this kiosk that we were ro	156.1197509765625
21461/28840	A ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the	114.46621704101562
21462/28840	But beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were	104.95128631591797
21463/28840	In this place were together 60000 pouches and 200 barrels the pouches contained 25000000 of money in gold and the barrels were filled with 30000 pounds of gun	214.44134521484375
21464/28840	Near the barrels stood Selim my fathers favorite whom I mentioned to you just	170.4563446044922
21465/28840	He stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everythingkiosk guards women gold and Ali Tepelini himselfat the first signal given by my	164.8778076171875
21466/28840	I remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and gro	237.65066528320312
21467/28840	As for me I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world I am quite sure I shall recognize Sel	72.81676483154297
21468/28840	I cannot tell you how long we remained in this state at that period I did not even know what time	42.34267807006836
21469/28840	Sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as I never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and Selims fiery l	104.85128784179688
21470/28840	One morning my father sent for us my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than	122.82979583740234

21472/28840	If my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to Yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this	165.69583129882812
21473/28840	But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my	70.1861572265625
21474/28840	Oh make yourself easy on that head said Ali smiling Selim and his flaming lance will settle that	198.9342803955078
21475/28840	They would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with	43.542724609375
21476/28840	My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my fathers	127.9399642944336
21477/28840	Presently he made such a sudden movement that I was paralyzed with	111.1246337890625
21478/28840	Then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his	67.73263549804688
21479/28840	My mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she	128.5596923828125
21480/28840	A boattwothree murmured my fatherfour He then arose seizing his arms and priming his	300.4281921386719
21481/28840	Vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide	231.08139038085938
21482/28840	In the space of half an hour we shall know the emperors	53.96632385253906
21483/28840	I will not quit you said Vasiliki if you die my lord I will die with	27.28884506225586
21484/28840	Adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of	117.88432312011719
21485/28840	Take away Vasiliki said my father to his Palik	69.31781005859375
21486/28840	As for me I had been forgotten in the general confusion I ran toward Ali Tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his	55.766536712646484
21487/28840	Oh how distinctly I remember that kissit was the last he ever gave me and I feel as if it were still warm on my	77.427490234375
21488/28840	On descending we saw through the latticework several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our	321.8427734375
21489/28840	At first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the	224.5369110107422
21490/28840	During this time in the kiosk at my fathers feet were seated twenty Palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the	88.57849884033203
21491/28840	They were armed with their long guns inlaid with motherofpearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the	97.34202575683594
21492/28840	My father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest	69.48048400878906
21493/28840	This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last	108.9992446899414
21494/28840	My mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the	122.81210327148438
21495/28840	Selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we	72.78347778320312
21496/28840	We fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by Sel	35.76064682006836
21497/28840	In great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as I was I quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our	178.3436737060547
21498/28840	Monte Cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and	41.25293731689453
21499/28840	Go on my child said the count in the Romaic	33.92011260986328
21500/28840	40074m       Haydée looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristos voice had awakened her from a dream and she resumed her	48.317718505859375
21501/28840	It was about four oclock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant outofdoors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the	46.31772994995117
21502/28840	One single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was Selims flaming l	236.63681030273438
21503/28840	My mother was a Christian and she	191.5519256591797
21504/28840	Selim repeated from time to time the sacred words God is great However my mother had still some	257.2928161621094
21505/28840	As she was coming down she thought she recognized the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the French emperor were naturally noble and	83.51298522949219
21506/28840	She advanced some steps towards the staircase and	185.9113311767578
21507/28840	They are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty   What do you fear Vasiliki said Selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so	55.70838165283203
21508/28840	If they do not bring us peace we will give them war if they do not bring life we will give them	77.52667999267578
21509/28840	And he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of Dionysus of old Cre	127.74976348876953
21510/28840	16 But I being only a little child was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and I recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited	194.0873260498047
21511/28840	My mother experienced the same sensations for I felt her trem	189.52891540527344
21512/28840	Mamma mamma said I are we really to be killed And at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lament	80.4750747680664
21513/28840	My child said Vasiliki may God preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread Then whispering to Selim she asked what were her masters	171.0960693359375
21514/28840	Suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of	263.58343505859375
21515/28840	The name of the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was	40.05323028564453
21516/28840	And do you not remember the Frenchmans name said Morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the	63.13923263549805
21517/28840	Monte Cristo made a sign to him to be	67.11785125732422

21519/28840	The noise increased steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the steps leading to the	263.7217102050781
21520/28840	Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy	87.78550720214844
21521/28840	But whoever you may be I charge you not to advance another	188.77561950683594

21526/28840	And she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to God in my behalf to raise me actually to his	72.7918701171875
21527/28840	And for the second time Haydée stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and	121.53495025634766
21528/28840	40076m       Monte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of commandCour	67.09771728515625
21529/28840	Haydée dried her eyes and continued   By this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pashait was a	112.38184356689453

21531/28840	In whose name do you come said he to	50.43001937866211
21532/28840	I come in the name of our master Ali Tepel	22.71706771850586
21533/28840	If you come from Ali himself said Selim you know what you were charged to remit to meYes said the messenger and I bring you his	79.86416625976562
21534/28840	At these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable Selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his	79.35939025878906
21535/28840	I do not see what you have in your hand said Sel	25.832611083984375
21536/28840	Approach then said the messenger or I will come nearer to you if you prefer	93.6035385131836
21537/28840	I will agree to neither one nor the other replied the young soldier place the object which I desire to see in the ray of light which shines there and retire while I examine	102.398681640625
21538/28840	Be it so said the envoy and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by Sel	106.31233978271484
21539/28840	Oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed	97.52313232421875
21540/28840	But was it my fathers ring that was the	164.01541137695312
21541/28840	Selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the	96.56562805175781

21543/28840	The messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his	42.70891571044922
21544/28840	At this signal four soldiers of the Seraskier Kourchid suddenly appeared and Selim fell pierced by five	185.23837280273438
21545/28840	Each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of	159.6061248779297
21546/28840	At this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and	124.60100555419922
21547/28840	The lower rooms were entirely filled with Kourchids troops that is to say with our	224.64764404296875
21548/28840	Just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening	78.33816528320312
21549/28840	My mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards I luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing	131.583740234375
21550/28840	What do you want said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of	80.56231689453125
21551/28840	What we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his high	84.46602630615234

21554/28840	40078m       My father answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two	67.50747680664062
21555/28840	The Palikares who were prostrated at my fathers feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and	101.2681655883789
21556/28840	At the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round	153.96914672851562
21557/28840	Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with	111.07965087890625
21558/28840	My father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks	235.12828063964844
21559/28840	But immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly dev	118.40205383300781
21560/28840	In the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with	145.85598754882812
21561/28840	These two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful	75.10124206542969
21562/28840	However he remained standing clinging to a	60.35714340209961

21569/28840	Oh it is nothing said Monte Crist	18.297832489013672

21576/28840	Who and where is heHe is	75.42535400390625
21577/28840	And Kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father said Haydée in a tone of chastened	61.057552337646484
21578/28840	Then said Albert you became the property of this man   40080m       No replied Haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slavemerchants who were going to	33.828941345214844

21583/28840	Oh you are good you are great my lord said Haydée kissing the counts hand and I am very fortunate in belonging to such a master   Albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and	36.2899055480957

21587/28840	Villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter   After all the disclosures which were made this morning	53.63261795043945
21588/28840	Noirtier de Villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of	52.258087158203125
21589/28840	dÉpinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that	70.6404037475586
21590/28840	de Villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this	52.202781677246094
21591/28840	And in justice to Villefort it must be understood that	44.481685638427734
21592/28840	This harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of Ville	181.5916290283203
21593/28840	Hardly had he read the letter when his wife	96.46511840820312
21594/28840	The sudden departure of Franz after being summoned by	478.629638671875
21595/28840	Noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of Madame de Villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more	47.91641616821289
21596/28840	Determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden	103.89623260498047
21597/28840	de Villeforts communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between	77.28510284423828
21598/28840	dÉpinay and himself and that the marriage of Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken	104.74345397949219
21599/28840	This was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were	115.51017761230469
21600/28840	She therefore contented herself with saying that	159.11166381835938
21601/28840	Noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days	58.46791076660156
21602/28840	This news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a	86.70661163330078

21605/28840	In the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of Valentines	63.8665657043457
21606/28840	She expected every moment that she should see Morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the Laird of Ravenswood in _The Bride of Lammermoor	145.88694763183594
21607/28840	It was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for Maximilian had long awaited her	80.86817169189453
21608/28840	He had half guessed what was going on when he saw Franz quit the cemetery with	108.819091796875
21609/28840	dÉpinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then reenter with Albert and ChâteauRen	38.29487609863281
21610/28840	He was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the	62.1562614440918
21611/28840	The first glance which Maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with	90.44169616699219

21614/28840	However he would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine again the next	118.35000610351562
21615/28840	Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry	72.13629150390625
21616/28840	During the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed Madame de Villefort had gone to visit	46.5306282043457
21617/28840	The old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive	66.90251922607422
21618/28840	Sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentines marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was	50.547767639160156
21619/28840	But one thing I can tell you of which I do not think you are aware that is that I have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approb	36.71164321899414
21620/28840	Noirtier regarded his daughterinlaw with the look of a man desiring an	56.400516510009766
21621/28840	Now that this marriage which I know you so much disliked is done away with I come to you on an errand which neither	99.60216522216797
21622/28840	de Villefort nor Valentine could consistently	83.90083312988281
21623/28840	Noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her	149.8177947998047
21624/28840	There was a doubtful expression in Noirtiers eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing	60.06759262084961
21625/28840	May I hope sir said Madame de Villefort that your intentions accord with my request   Noirtier made a sign that they	22.777618408203125
21626/28840	In that case sir rejoined Madame de Villefort I will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my	56.57810592651367
21627/28840	Noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to Valentine on condition that she should never be separated from	53.72881317138672
21628/28840	While all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriagecontract were being carried on at the house of	71.90979766845703
21629/28840	de Villefort Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to	21.135950088500977
21630/28840	Danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best	86.15559387207031
21631/28840	At the first sight of his old friend Danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy	60.614498138427734
21632/28840	40086m       Well baron said he here I am at last some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet	46.18496322631836
21633/28840	Morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars and which he attributed to his silence but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and	93.67560577392578
21634/28840	To what do you allude monsieur said Danglars as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the generals	35.22658157348633
21635/28840	Ah said Morcerf I see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be	56.63471221923828
21636/28840	_Ma foi_ I beg your pardon but as I have but one son and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him I am still serving my apprenticeship you know come I will	55.08414840698242
21637/28840	And Morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to	44.14030456542969
21638/28840	Danglars said   Baron I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars for my son the Vicomte Albert de Morcer	12.527583122253418
21639/28840	I do not understand you baron said Morcer	12.541913986206055
21640/28840	de Monte Cristo have you not   I see him very often said Danglars drawing himself up he is a particular friend of	34.52598571777344
21641/28840	Well in one of your late conversations with him you said that I appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not   I did say	93.89581298828125
21642/28840	Well here I am proving at once that I am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that	71.80656433105469
21643/28840	Danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just	34.84128189086914
21644/28840	I am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the	33.51249313354492
21645/28840	What do you mean to say   I mean to say that I have a good reason but that it is difficult to	17.485595703125
21646/28840	You must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my	74.52949523925781
21647/28840	No sir said Danglars I merely suspend my decision that is	40.02269744873047
21648/28840	A cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned	239.7174072265625
21649/28840	My dear Danglars said Morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each others	29.03345489501953
21650/28840	You owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that I should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your	82.95075988769531
21651/28840	It is from no personal illfeeling towards the viscount that is all I can say sir replied Danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and calmed	45.746952056884766
21652/28840	And towards whom do you bear this personal illfeeling then said Morcerf turning pale with	63.993106842041016
21653/28840	The expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said   You may perhaps be better satisfied that I should not go farther into	66.70384216308594
21654/28840	A tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said I have a right to insist on your giving me an	88.01204681396484
21655/28840	No do not seek any longer to discover the	76.32437896728516
21656/28840	I really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe selfexamination let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an	189.9475555419922
21657/28840	My daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twenty	198.38287353515625
21658/28840	Calumnies did you say sir cried Morcerf turning livid with	94.37547302246094
21659/28840	Does anyone dare to slander me   Monsieur I told you that I considered it best to avoid all	83.42334747314453
21660/28840	Enough sir said Morcerf we will speak no more on the	31.30657386779785

21662/28840	Danglars observed that during the whole conversation Morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that Danglars recalled his	32.6464729309082
21663/28840	That evening he had a long conference with several friends and	159.5925750732422

21665/28840	The next morning as soon as he awoke Danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on _lImpartial_ the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief	40.76765060424805
21666/28840	He hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious smile at a paragraph headed   _We hear from Yan	201.323974609375
21667/28840	_     Very good observed Danglars after having read the paragraph here is a little article on Colonel Fernand which if I am not mistaken would render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me perfectly	52.34055709838867
21668/28840	When he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about half an hour	51.257198333740234
21669/28840	Did he take Baptistin with him   No my	35.38883590698242
21670/28840	Call him then I wish to speak to	27.10169792175293
21671/28840	The concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an	20.839256286621094
21672/28840	My good friend said Albert I beg pardon for my intrusion but I was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or	62.28297424316406
21673/28840	He is really out sir replied Baptist	76.34174346923828
21674/28840	Out even to me   I know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said Baptistin and I should therefore never think of including him in any general	61.43082809448242
21675/28840	You are right and now I wish to see him on an affair of great	40.44783020019531
21676/28840	Do you think it will be long before he comes in   No I think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten o	50.724281311035156
21677/28840	Albert left the cab in which he had come at the counts door intending to take a turn on	52.61590576171875
21678/28840	As he was passing the Allée des Veuves he thought he saw the counts horses standing at Gossets shootinggallery he approached and soon recognized the coach	156.27549743652344
21679/28840	Is the count shooting in the gallery said Morcer	45.91636657714844
21680/28840	While he was speaking Albert had heard the report of two or three pistol	55.769195556640625
21681/28840	He entered and on his way met the	138.883544921875
21682/28840	Excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment   What for Philip asked Albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his	98.2209243774414
21683/28840	Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of	76.23053741455078
21684/28840	Not even before you Philip Then who loads his pistol   His	147.4347686767578

21686/28840	Oh that is quite another thing	38.375125885009766
21687/28840	I will go immediately and inform him of your	64.1910171508789
21688/28840	And Philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery a second afterwards Monte Cristo appeared on the	114.08712005615234
21689/28840	I ask your pardon my dear count said Albert for following you here and I must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that I did so I alone am to blame for the indisc	46.52560043334961
21690/28840	I went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten oclock to	58.33176803588867
21691/28840	I was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten oclock when I caught sight of your carriage and	73.50786590576172
21692/28840	What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with	86.56269073486328
21693/28840	40092m       No thank you I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse	102.4605712890625
21694/28840	What on earth are you talking of   I am to fight	65.75558471679688
21695/28840	For what   For the sake of fighting   Yes I understand that but what is the quarrel People fight for all sorts of reasons you	64.36824798583984
21696/28840	I fight in the cause of	92.03730010986328
21697/28840	So serious that I come to beg you to render me a	85.29497528076172
21698/28840	What is it   To be my	34.23638153076172
21699/28840	That is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get	102.26322174072266
21700/28840	The count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after	111.43095397949219
21701/28840	Come in my lord said Philip in a low tone and I will show you something d	48.16544723510742
21702/28840	Morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playingcards fixed against the	136.33062744140625
21703/28840	At a distance Albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the	140.72584533691406
21704/28840	Ah ha said Albert I see you were preparing for a game of	103.89717102050781
21705/28840	No said the count I was making a	47.67249298095703
21706/28840	Those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and	499.1626892089844
21707/28840	In fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with	232.63851928710938
21708/28840	In going up to the target Morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the counts	58.152137756347656
21709/28840	What would you have my dear viscount said Monte Cristo wiping his hands on the towel which Ali had brought him I must occupy my leisure moments in some way or	36.3589973449707
21710/28840	But come I am waiting for	32.91484832763672
21711/28840	Both men entered Monte Cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at	109.56651306152344
21712/28840	Monte Cristo took Albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for	201.1027374267578
21713/28840	Now let us talk the matter over quietly said the	66.01583862304688
21714/28840	You see I am perfectly composed said	253.80560302734375
21715/28840	With whom are you going to fight   With Beauch	26.248214721679688
21716/28840	One of your friends   Of course it is always with friends that one	68.06011199951172
21717/28840	I suppose you have some cause of quarrel   I	35.93080139160156
21718/28840	40094m       What has he done to you   There appeared in his journal last nightbut wait and read for	73.60298156738281
21719/28840	And Albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows   A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in	106.97492980957031
21720/28840	The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand in whom the grand vizier Ali Tepelini had reposed the greatest	60.635372161865234
21721/28840	Oh my dear viscount do talk reason   I do not desire to do	44.60439682006836
21722/28840	They have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high	112.50001525878906
21723/28840	I inherit my fathers name and I do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken	147.14083862304688
21724/28840	I am going to Beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and I shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two	92.47037506103516
21725/28840	No you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same	84.25700378417969
21726/28840	I will efface that blot on my fathers	222.44955444335938
21727/28840	My father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant   Oh well he will add We are warranted in believing that this Fernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf who also bears the same Christian	75.45398712158203
21728/28840	I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retract	94.17098999023438
21729/28840	And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you  	44.70258712768555
21730/28840	Which means I suppose that you refuse the service which I asked of you   You know my theory regarding duels I told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at	71.5765609741211
21731/28840	Nevertheless my dear count I found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to	122.9651107788086
21732/28840	Because my dear fellow you understand one must never be	80.04037475585938
21733/28840	If ones lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study	510.1712646484375
21734/28840	You admit that you would fight then Well if so why do you object to my doing so   I do not say that you ought not to fight I only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due	65.08229064941406
21735/28840	Did he reflect before he insulted my father   If he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be	88.90296173095703
21736/28840	Ah my dear count you are far too indul	91.54751586914062
21737/28840	Supposing for instance and do not be angry at what I am going to say  	33.682350158691406
21738/28840	Supposing the assertion to be really true   A son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers	192.4716339111328
21739/28840	_Ma foi_ we live in times when there is much to which we must	155.85325622558594
21740/28840	That is precisely the fault of the	133.9215850830078
21741/28840	And do you undertake to reform it   Yes as far as I am personally	55.94082260131836
21742/28840	Well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow   Yes I own	55.84833908081055
21743/28840	Are you quite impervious to good advice   Not when it comes from a	101.06873321533203
21744/28840	And do you account me that title   Certainly I	69.99634552001953
21745/28840	Well then before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the	147.0386505126953
21746/28840	You reject this means of information then   I domost	446.6561279296875
21747/28840	Then let me offer one more word of	246.84002685546875
21748/28840	Do so then but let it be the	106.20108032226562
21749/28840	You do not wish to hear it perhaps   On the contrary I request	25.729549407958984
21750/28840	Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchampvisit him	84.05447387695312
21751/28840	That would be contrary to all	255.55604553222656
21752/28840	Your case is not an ordinary	225.9559326171875
21753/28840	And what is your reason for advising me to go alone   Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauch	49.03480911254883
21754/28840	If Beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free willthe satisfaction to you will be the	76.19267272949219
21755/28840	If on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your	93.89447021484375
21756/28840	They will not be strangers they will be	100.5259017944336
21757/28840	Ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow Beauchamp for	108.70515441894531
21758/28840	So you recommend   I recommend you to be	80.16871643066406
21759/28840	Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp   I do and I will tell you	23.857187271118164
21760/28840	When you wish to obtain some concession from a mans selflove you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound	132.219482421875
21761/28840	Go but you would do better still by not going at	140.84996032714844
21762/28840	Do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you	85.6030502319336
21763/28840	Why   Perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time I request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my	102.19326782226562
21764/28840	Well I will have Franz and ChâteauRenaud they will be the very men for	32.203067779541016
21765/28840	But if I do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing   That too is	146.29969787597656
21766/28840	What a singular being you areyou will not interfere in	189.96475219726562
21767/28840	You are rightthat is the principle on which I wish to	68.69953918457031
21768/28840	We will say no more about it	68.1659927368164
21769/28840	Morcerf took his hat and left the	37.732093811035156
21770/28840	He found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp who was in his	54.46052551269531
21771/28840	It was a gloomy dustylooking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immem	295.97845458984375
21772/28840	Beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be	53.71061325073242
21773/28840	Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the	83.71927642822266
21774/28840	This way this way my dear Albert said he holding out his hand to the young	34.47045135498047
21775/28840	Beauchamp said Albert it is of your journal that I come to	87.06075286865234
21776/28840	Indeed What do you wish to say about it   I desire that a statement contained in it should be rect	56.817344665527344
21777/28840	To what do you refer But pray sit	94.8138198852539
21778/28840	Thank you said Albert with a cold and formal	116.44207000732422
21779/28840	Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you   An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my	59.79530334472656
21780/28840	What is it said Beauchamp much surprised surely you must be	56.144935607910156
21781/28840	Yanina   Yes really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me	93.53130340576172
21782/28840	Such is really the case I assure you upon my honor Baptiste give me yesterdays paper cried Beauch	100.99440002441406
21783/28840	Here I have brought mine with me replied	121.55117797851562
21784/28840	Beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which Albert pointed in an undert	85.69547271728516
21785/28840	You see it is a serious annoyance said Morcerf when Beauchamp had finished the perusal of the	33.8353157043457
21786/28840	Is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the	121.98252868652344
21787/28840	Well what do you wish me to do for you said Beauchamp	15.14140796661377
21788/28840	My dear Beauchamp I wish you to contradict this	44.52823257446289
21789/28840	Beauchamp looked at Albert with a benevolent	69.28067016601562
21790/28840	Come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you	112.17604064941406
21791/28840	Sit down and I will read it	63.858070373535156
21792/28840	Albert resumed his seat and Beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his	70.53339385986328
21793/28840	Well said Albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and I insist on a retractation being	99.57718658447266
21794/28840	You insist   Yes I	104.9945297241211
21795/28840	Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber my dear vis	36.10478973388672
21796/28840	Nor do I wish to be there replied the young man	32.62739562988281
21797/28840	I repeat that I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday	63.376502990722656
21798/28840	You have known me long enough continued Albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that Beauchamps anger was beginning to riseyou have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this	70.53507995605469
21799/28840	If I have been your friend Morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that	82.14491271972656
21800/28840	But wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not	68.46385955810547
21801/28840	You are irritated and vexedtell me how this Fernand is related to you   He is merely my father said Albert	82.57447814941406
21802/28840	Fernand Mondego Count of Morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of	86.30583190917969
21803/28840	Is it your father said Beauchamp that is quite another	24.528461456298828
21804/28840	Then I can well understand your indignation my dear	80.77999877929688
21805/28840	I will look at it again and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he	89.85533142089844
21806/28840	But the paper nowhere identifies this Fernand with your	118.6755599975586
21807/28840	40100m       No but the connection will be seen by others and therefore I will have the article	70.25640869140625
21808/28840	At the words _I will_ Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to Alberts countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few	62.77472686767578
21809/28840	You will retract this assertion will you not Beauchamp said Albert with increased though stifled	114.55904388427734
21810/28840	When I am convinced that the statement is	110.9887466430664
21811/28840	What   The thing is worth looking into and I will take pains to investigate the matter	112.80447387695312
21812/28840	But what is there to investigate sir said Albert enraged beyond measure at Beauchamps last	188.55287170410156
21813/28840	If you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing	66.7186050415039
21814/28840	Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his	83.03592681884766
21815/28840	Sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which I have been patiently listening for the last half	76.3708724975586

21831/28840	When he had concluded his speech Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert turned his back upon him and went to the press	71.3522720336914
21832/28840	He was passing the Chinese Baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the Porte SaintMartin and to be going towards the Madele	42.46736526489258
21833/28840	Ah said Morcerf there goes a happy man And it so happened Albert was not mistaken in his	100.18346405029297
21834/28840	The Lemonade   Morrel was in fact very	79.8069076538086
21835/28840	Noirtier had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab	59.09421157836914
21836/28840	He had therefore set off at a furious rate from the Rue Meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the Faubourg SaintHonor	19.306121826171875
21837/28840	Morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor Barrois followed him as he best	142.3252716064453
21838/28840	Morrel was only thirtyone Barrois was sixty years of age Morrel was deeply in love and Barrois was dying with heat and exert	77.03334045410156
21839/28840	These two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of	376.13348388671875
21840/28840	On arriving at the house Morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but Barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to	81.8825454711914
21841/28840	The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of	109.7157211303711
21842/28840	She looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her	130.98277282714844
21843/28840	But the easychair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the	54.485172271728516
21844/28840	Noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of Valentine and himselfan intervention which had saved them from	113.87222290039062
21845/28840	Morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on	118.06507873535156
21846/28840	Valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to	41.202728271484375
21847/28840	Am I to say what you told me asked	40.81262969970703
21848/28840	Noirtier made a sign that she was to do	15.967467308044434
21849/28840	Monsieur Morrel said Valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather	34.85612106323242
21850/28840	Noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that I may repeat them to	37.27345275878906
21851/28840	I will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter I will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his	75.7755355834961

21853/28840	Valentine cast down her eyes this was a good omen for Morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming	86.82614135742188
21854/28840	My grandfather intends leaving this house said she and Barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in	194.95895385742188

21861/28840	Valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but Morrels intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear	70.84181213378906
21862/28840	Have I not explained your wishes grandpapa said Valentine addressing Noirt	37.88996505737305
21863/28840	Morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness in that case I shall expect	129.40646362304688
21864/28840	Morrel to come and claim me at my own	185.69381713867188

21868/28840	Morrel the justice to say that he ran still	220.76010131835938
21869/28840	Noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a	69.05876159667969
21870/28840	The decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by	70.58222198486328
21871/28840	Come Barrois said the young girl take some of this lemonade I see you are coveting a good draught of	35.5479850769043
21872/28840	The fact is mademoiselle said Barrois I am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me I cannot say I should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of	65.15921020507812
21873/28840	Take some then and come back	313.9287414550781
21874/28840	Barrois took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the door which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which Valentine had	157.34474182128906
21875/28840	Valentine and Morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was heard at the door	40.043704986572266
21876/28840	It was the signal of a	48.7563362121582

21886/28840	What is the matter Barrois said	25.624359130859375
21887/28840	The old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand	107.49552917480469
21888/28840	He is going to fall cried Mor	30.623699188232422
21889/28840	The rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous	136.17579650878906
21890/28840	Noirtier seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of	163.09326171875
21891/28840	Barrois made some steps towards his	305.20623779296875

21902/28840	One might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless	131.4545440673828

21909/28840	Her first look on entering the room was at Noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying	77.03594970703125
21910/28840	She turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the	89.51487731933594

21927/28840	The young man pressed Valentines hand to his lips and then left the house by a back	39.685359954833984

22123/28840	de Monte Cristo did not make his proposal for you   Andrea blushed impercept	41.80132293701172

22126/28840	He has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never	99.7445068359375
22127/28840	I must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable	90.54733276367188
22128/28840	Besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to	77.1192626953125

22130/28840	And what may you have to say to him said Danglars laughing in his	18.697021484375
22131/28840	That the day after tomorrow I shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs but the count expecting my bachelors revenue could not suffice for the coming months outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand franc	72.00810241699219

22137/28840	The following morning with the bankers usual punctuality the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young mans hands as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred francs for Cader	39.46601867675781
22138/28840	He went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the	109.80721282958984
22139/28840	But scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his	59.82154083251953
22140/28840	Sir said he that man has been	61.60398864746094

22151/28840	Andrea examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents but it was so carefully folded that no one could have read it and the seal was	119.56210327148438
22152/28840	Poor man he is a worthy	76.42675018310547
22153/28840	He left the porter to ponder on these words not knowing which most to admire the master or the	145.91114807128906
22154/28840	Take out the horses quickly and come up to me said Andrea to his	103.48426818847656
22155/28840	In two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt Caderousses	56.46641540527344
22156/28840	The servant entered just as he had	104.94598388671875

22165/28840	40132m       Andrea went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hares paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable illtem	82.30653381347656
22166/28840	A moment after Caderousses face appeared at the grating in the	50.36701965332031

22174/28840	While speaking Caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of	102.75921630859375
22175/28840	But said Andrea illtemperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me I wish the devil had taken you   My boy said Caderousse sententiously one can talk while	77.50244140625
22176/28840	And then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend I am weeping with	68.58344268798828
22177/28840	He was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the PontduG	103.88493347167969

22277/28840	Well then I must be contented to imagine	55.36980056762695
22278/28840	That is the best plan believe	129.89114379882812
22279/28840	Try at least to give me an idea of what it	23.645559310913086
22280/28840	How can I   Nothing is	118.00135803222656
22281/28840	How is it arranged   Faith I should require pen ink and paper to make a	66.2992172241211
22282/28840	They are all here said Caderousse brisk	73.04684448242188
22283/28840	He fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and	92.36483764648438
22284/28840	Here said Caderousse draw me all that on the paper my	75.46438598632812
22285/28840	Andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and	61.910980224609375
22286/28840	The house as I said is between the court and the garden in this way do you see Andrea drew the garden the court and the	86.79977416992188
22287/28840	40142m       High walls   Not more than eight or ten	32.997093200683594
22288/28840	In the court are orangetrees in pots turf and clumps of	119.50943756103516
22289/28840	The stables   Are on either side of the gate which you see	65.29718017578125
22290/28840	Let us see the ground floor said Cader	28.477510452270508
22291/28840	On the ground floor diningroom two drawingrooms billiardroom staircase in the hall and a little back	160.83900451660156
22292/28840	Windows   Magnificent windows so beautiful so large that I believe a man of your size should pass through each	111.38176727294922
22293/28840	Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows   Luxury has	182.72845458984375
22294/28840	But shutters   Yes but they are never	46.8692512512207
22295/28840	That Count of Monte Cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at	57.905208587646484
22296/28840	And where do the servants sleep   Oh they have a house to	147.95809936523438
22297/28840	Picture to yourself a pretty coachhouse at the righthand side where the ladders are	127.51660919189453
22298/28840	Well over that coachhouse are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different	216.00465393066406
22299/28840	I was saying to him only yesterday You are imprudent Monsieur Count for when you go to Auteuil and take your servants the house is left	58.65930938720703
22300/28840	Well said he what next Well next some day you will be	283.0717468261719
22301/28840	What did he answer   He quietly said What do I care if I am   Andrea he has some secretaire with a	66.75294494628906
22302/28840	How do you know   Yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a	85.78803253173828
22303/28840	I was told there were such at the last	157.41409301757812
22304/28840	He has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always	170.05238342285156
22305/28840	And he is not robbed   No his servants are all devoted to	83.1176528930664
22306/28840	There ought to be some money in that secretaire   There may	64.26210021972656
22307/28840	And where is it   On the first	34.78266906738281
22308/28840	Sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my	134.0829315185547
22309/28840	On the first story do you see there is the anteroom and the drawingroom to the right of the drawingroom a library and a study to the left a bedroom and a dressing	44.07170867919922
22310/28840	The famous secretaire is in the dressing	120.21248626708984
22311/28840	Is there a window in the dressingroom   Twoone here and one	68.29114532470703
22312/28840	Andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the	135.7748260498047
22313/28840	Does he often go to Auteuil added	42.363014221191406
22314/28840	Tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night	52.0635986328125
22315/28840	Are you sure of it   He has invited me to dine	30.05943489074707
22316/28840	Theres a life for you said Caderousse a town house and a country	98.31937408447266
22317/28840	That is what it is to be	54.091270446777344
22318/28840	And shall you dine there  	145.60186767578125
22319/28840	When you dine there do you sleep there   If I like I am at home	75.07568359375
22320/28840	Caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his	33.23770523071289
22321/28840	But Andrea drew a cigarcase from his pocket took a Havana quietly lit it and began	244.15289306640625
22322/28840	When do you want your twelve hundred francs said he to Cader	21.06190299987793
22323/28840	Andrea took fiveandtwenty louis from his	60.8560905456543
22324/28840	Yellow boys said Caderousse no I thank	76.59764862060547
22325/28840	On the contrary I esteem them but will not have	119.6114273071289
22326/28840	You can change them idiot gold is worth five s	461.537109375
22327/28840	Exactly and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse lay hands on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in	185.11483764648438
22328/28840	No nonsense my good fellow silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on	185.20895385742188
22329/28840	But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me I should want a p	63.98282241821289
22330/28840	Well leave them with your porter he is to be	79.80972290039062
22331/28840	Today   No tomorrow I shall not have time	61.95761489868164
22332/28840	Well tomorrow I will leave them when I go to Auteu	32.025264739990234
22333/28840	May I depend on it  	66.244140625
22334/28840	Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of	109.3078384399414
22335/28840	Now see here will that be all Eh And will you not torment me any more  	102.90322875976562
22336/28840	Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the	72.56040954589844
22337/28840	How sprightly you are said Caderousse One would say you were already in possession of your	46.91400146484375
22338/28840	No unfortunately but when I do obtain it   Well   I shall remember old friends I can tell you	64.54090881347656
22339/28840	Yes since you have such a good	39.19820022583008
22340/28840	What do you want It looks as if you were trying to fleece me   I What an idea I who am going to give you another piece of good	58.086181640625
22341/28840	What is it   To leave behind you the diamond you have on your	69.84998321533203
22342/28840	You will ruin both yourself and me by your	187.141845703125
22343/28840	How You put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand franc	103.61051177978516
22344/28840	I know something of diamonds I have had	106.14949035644531
22345/28840	You do well to boast of it said Andrea who without becoming angry as Caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the	136.869873046875
22346/28840	Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were	85.07843017578125
22347/28840	It is a false diamond said Cader	21.96725845336914
22348/28840	Do not be angry we can try	116.61114501953125
22349/28840	Caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would	70.0249252319336
22350/28840	_Confiteor_ said Caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger I was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jewellers shopit is another branch of industry	112.97846221923828
22351/28840	Have you finished said Andreado you want anything morewill you have my waistcoat or my hat Make free now you have	233.25099182128906
22352/28840	No you are after all a good companion I will not detain you and will try to cure myself of my	86.07445526123047
22353/28840	But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the	80.81586456298828
22354/28840	I shall not sell itdo not	137.99954223632812
22355/28840	Not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young	35.452606201171875
22356/28840	Happy rogue said Caderousse you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed   Yes said	30.76622200012207
22357/28840	Well I hope you will make a handsome weddingpresent the day you marry Mademoiselle Dangl	19.486270904541016
22358/28840	I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your	33.764747619628906
22359/28840	What fortune has she   But I tell you   A million   Andrea shrugged his	32.92422866821289
22360/28840	Let it be a million said Caderousse you can never have so much as I wish	29.45939826965332
22361/28840	Oh I wish it you with all my heart added Caderousse with his hoarse	48.67536926269531
22362/28840	Stop let me show you the	55.177001953125
22363/28840	Why   Because there is a little secret a precaution I thought it desirable to take one of Huret  Fichets locks revised and improved by Gaspard Caderousse I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a	103.49615478515625
22364/28840	Thank you said Andrea I will let you know a week	75.83416748046875
22365/28840	Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen Andrea go down the three stories but also cross the	102.60478973388672
22366/28840	Then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan Andrea had left	104.85308837890625
22367/28840	Dear Benedetto said he I think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst	51.96783447265625
22368/28840	He was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to Andrea either by the arrival of Bertuccio from Normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sl	72.71115112304688
22369/28840	The house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to	98.57032775878906
22370/28840	The count praised Bertuccios zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in France would not be prolonged more than a	131.90310668945312
22371/28840	Now said he I may require to go in one night from Paris to Tréport let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten	96.55347442626953
22372/28840	Your highness had already expressed that wish said Bertuccio and the horses are	95.21400451660156
22373/28840	I have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally	148.92605590820312
22374/28840	Thats well said Monte Cristo I remain here a day or twoarrange	90.72699737548828
22375/28840	As Bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders Baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver	54.946136474609375
22376/28840	What are you doing here asked the count seeing him covered with dust I did not send for you I think   Baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the	43.431888580322266
22377/28840	The count opened the letter and read  	75.22601318359375
22378/28840	de Monte Cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the ChampsÉlysées with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing	31.607694625854492
22379/28840	The counts wellknown courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this	383.8822937011719
22380/28840	The count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressingroom would be able to defend his property	60.6955680847168
22381/28840	Many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and	486.1057434082031
22382/28840	de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the counta warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be	102.8307876586914
22383/28840	The counts first idea was that this was an artificea gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a	126.44229888916016
22384/28840	We know the counts vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great	250.01492309570312
22385/28840	From his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against God and sometimes against the world that is against the	120.96581268310547
22386/28840	They do not want my papers said Monte Cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but	61.54573440551758
22387/28840	I will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private	42.54719161987305
22388/28840	I am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this	90.59656524658203
22389/28840	The count recalled Baptistin who had left the room after delivering the	90.51581573486328
22390/28840	Return to Paris said he assemble the servants who remain	155.73365783691406
22391/28840	I want all my household at Auteu	31.954113006591797
22392/28840	But will no one remain in the house my lord asked Baptist	72.74628448486328
22393/28840	My lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the	66.26571655273438
22394/28840	Well   The house might be stripped without his hearing the least	102.17782592773438
22395/28840	Thieves might strip the houseit would annoy me less than to be disob	317.73089599609375
22396/28840	40150m       You understand me said the	14.856319427490234
22397/28840	Bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground	143.34144592285156
22398/28840	And those of the first floor   You know they are never	55.21213912963867
22399/28840	Go   The count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but Ali should attend	90.189208984375
22400/28840	All was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porters lodge about forty paces distant from the house as Baptistin had	87.50403594970703
22401/28840	Monte Cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passersby and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was	125.7750015258789
22402/28840	Ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching	96.5044937133789
22403/28840	Arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to Ali to stop then he passed into the dressingroom which he	85.12619018554688
22404/28840	Everything appeared as usualthe precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secret	61.482112884521484
22405/28840	He double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went	169.52854919433594
22406/28840	Meanwhile Ali had procured the arms the count requirednamely a short carbine and a pair of doublebarrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a singlebarrelled	99.06559753417969
22407/28840	Thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his	97.96781921386719
22408/28840	The count and Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine then Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining	89.18867492675781
22409/28840	He had within his reach his pistols and carbine and Ali standing near him held one of the small Arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the Crus	158.6598358154297
22410/28840	Through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressingroom the count could see into the	51.554420471191406
22411/28840	It was intensely dark still Ali thanks to his wild nature and the count thanks doubtless to his long confinement could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the	202.70521545410156
22412/28840	The little light in the lodge had long been	252.42076110839844
22413/28840	It might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in Monte Cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his	133.94329833984375
22414/28840	It would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing	59.07902908325195
22415/28840	The clock of the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three	208.41473388671875
22416/28840	A firm and wellpractised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a	126.9451675415039
22417/28840	The count felt his heart beat more	179.12991333007812
22418/28840	Inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the	108.29399871826172
22419/28840	However Monte Cristo only made a sign to apprise Ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his	71.18585205078125
22420/28840	Monte Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his	193.63473510742188
22421/28840	The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing	109.59912109375
22422/28840	He fixed his eyes on that windowhe distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without	111.11239624023438
22423/28840	Through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second the window turned on its hinges and a man	128.01605224609375
22424/28840	Thats a daring rascal whispered the	263.2909851074219
22425/28840	At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the	226.06716918945312
22426/28840	He turned Ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the	56.652347564697266
22427/28840	I see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands	121.96734619140625
22428/28840	He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressing	26.350650787353516
22429/28840	The glasscutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before	132.35446166992188
22430/28840	At last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his	118.9358139038086
22431/28840	There were two doors he bolted them	186.3807830810547
22432/28840	When he drew near to the bedroom door Monte Cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper	73.75778198242188
22433/28840	The nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full	147.5556640625
22434/28840	Alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was	91.17129516601562
22435/28840	But the glasscutter was a prudent man who had provided for all	67.83306121826172
22436/28840	The count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the	201.85507202148438
22437/28840	Ah ha whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a	41.400238037109375
22438/28840	But the man in the dark could not find the right	81.22135162353516
22439/28840	He reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and count	153.75653076171875

22442/28840	40154m       Then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knifegr	51.05327224731445
22443/28840	It was an order the count had just given for immediately Ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a threecornered	123.74718475341797
22444/28840	who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hat	103.75592041015625
22445/28840	The tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the threecornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abb	138.6100311279297
22446/28840	The man hearing nothing more stood erect and while Monte Cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nighting	139.57371520996094
22447/28840	Try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might betry again you have a few minutes work	130.5733184814453
22448/28840	Monte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to Ali he whispered   Remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if I call	150.46327209472656
22449/28840	Ali bowed in token of strict	383.286376953125

22451/28840	The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment the room was suddenly	183.44677734375
22452/28840	The count placed himself between Caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of	144.49220275878906

22500/28840	You are right it is not you who should apprise	62.659080505371094
22501/28840	Why not   Because you would bring us to	54.311588287353516
22502/28840	And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes   Reverend sir said Caderousse drawing still	113.72354125976562

22504/28840	At the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassins wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and Caderousse uttered a cry of	64.75956726074219

22526/28840	Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him Caderousse began to go	38.12367630004883
22527/28840	Then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the ChampsÉlysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a	25.074642181396484

22529/28840	He then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his	82.87754821777344
22530/28840	Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first Caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came	64.78779602050781
22531/28840	The count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come	57.3514518737793
22532/28840	Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was	167.10235595703125

22535/28840	Then Caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the	93.95475006103516
22536/28840	But once started he could not	168.1411895751953

22735/28840	But continued Monte Cristo you are not in your usual spirits   I have a dreadful headache said	38.92025375366211
22736/28840	Well my dear viscount said Monte Cristo I have an infallible remedy to propose to	18.163022994995117
22737/28840	What is that asked the young	22.726703643798828
22738/28840	Yes and as I am just now excessively annoyed I shall go from	59.14653778076172
22739/28840	Shall we go together   You annoyed count said Beauchamp and by what   Ah you think very lightly of it I should like to see you with a brief preparing in your	72.9293212890625

22744/28840	de Villefort heard of him at Marseilles and	38.71484375
22745/28840	I am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me vis	53.19557571411133
22746/28840	Then it is settled   Yes but where   I have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his	108.31491088867188
22747/28840	I love that humiliation I who am master of the universe as was	118.0097427368164
22748/28840	But where are you really going   To sea viscount you know I am a	47.19647979736328
22749/28840	You accept my proposal   I	43.18073654174805
22750/28840	Well viscount there will be in my courtyard this evening a good travelling britzka with four posthorses in which one may rest as in a	80.20033264160156
22751/28840	Beauchamp it holds four very well will you accompany us   Thank you I have just returned from	148.25733947753906
22752/28840	What you have been to sea   Yes I have just made a little excursion to the Borromean Islands	39.61037063598633
22753/28840	What of that come with us said	203.31430053710938
22754/28840	No dear Morcerf you know I only refuse when the thing is	50.408836364746094
22755/28840	Besides it is important added he in a low tone that I should remain in Paris just now to watch the	40.50123977661133
22756/28840	Ah you are a good and an excellent friend said Albert yes you are right watch watch Beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this	63.45182418823242
22757/28840	Albert and Beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a	97.3841781616211
22758/28840	Beauchamp is a worthy fellow said Monte Cristo when the journalist was gone is he not Albert   Yes and a sincere friend I love him devoted	90.6881103515625
22759/28840	But now we are alonealthough it is immaterial to mewhere are we going   Into Normandy if you	75.10904693603516
22760/28840	Delightful shall we be quite retired have no society no neighbors   Our companions will be ridinghorses dogs to hunt with and a fishing	267.28961181640625
22761/28840	Exactly what I wish for I will apprise my mother of my intention and return to	45.31260299682617
22762/28840	But shall you be allowed to go into Normandy   I may go where I	68.44805908203125
22763/28840	Yes I am aware you may go alone since I once met you in Italybut to accompany the mysterious Monte Cristo   You forget count that I have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in	68.70471954345703
22764/28840	woman is like a wave of the sea said Shakespeare both the great king and the great poet ought to have known womans nature	125.66410064697266
22765/28840	Womans yes my mother is not woman but _a_	576.7192993164062
22766/28840	As I am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if I do not understand all the subtle refinements of your	57.800132751464844
22767/28840	What I mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never	69.20386505126953
22768/28840	And does she try to make you dislike me   On the contrary she often says Morcerf I believe the count has a noble nature try to gain his	71.11541748046875
22769/28840	You see then said Albert that instead of opposing she will encourage	144.82669067382812
22770/28840	Adieu then until five oclock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or	148.14596557617188
22771/28840	At Tréport   Yes or in the	36.35145568847656
22772/28840	But can we travel fortyeight leagues in eight hours   Easily said Monte Crist	66.78936004638672
22773/28840	You are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in France but even the te	88.17276000976562
22774/28840	But viscount since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me	99.02465057373047
22775/28840	Do not fear I have little to	158.9732666015625
22776/28840	Monte Cristo smiled as he nodded to Albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep	245.64987182617188
22777/28840	But passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and Bertuccio	47.95527267456055
22778/28840	Bertuccio said he I intend going this evening to Normandy instead of tomorrow or the next	129.766845703125
22779/28840	You will have sufficient time before five oclock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first	80.46434020996094
22780/28840	Bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to Pontoise to say the travellingcarriage would arrive at six o	63.23040008544922
22781/28840	From Pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were	149.90884399414062
22782/28840	Before his departure the count went to Haydées apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her	116.39799499511719
22783/28840	The journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which Morcerf had formed no previous	163.02825927734375
22784/28840	The carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling	199.43748474121094
22785/28840	Ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the	211.3307647705078
22786/28840	This child of the desert was in his element and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared in the cloud of dust he raised like the genius of the simoom and the god of the	116.14987182617188
22787/28840	The thirtytwo that we shall use tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the	152.61126708984375
22788/28840	That is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses   You see I travel with	59.05683135986328
22789/28840	When I no longer require them Bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the	76.72789001464844
22790/28840	But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase	153.4518280029297
22791/28840	Then he will sell them to some Eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his	112.85989379882812
22792/28840	Count may I suggest one idea to you  	116.95574188232422
22793/28840	It is that next to you Bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in	85.74022674560547
22794/28840	You are mistaken viscount I believe he has not a franc in his	134.8459930419922
22795/28840	My dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things I warn you I shall not believe	40.3785514831543
22796/28840	I countenance nothing that is marvellous	54.4966926574707
22797/28840	Tell me why does a steward rob his master   Because I suppose it is his nature to do so for the love of	80.52425384521484
22798/28840	You are mistaken it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and	111.7927474975586
22799/28840	Also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the	103.47848510742188
22800/28840	Bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my	120.08409881591797
22801/28840	Why   Because I should never get a	45.5731086730957
22802/28840	But I deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and	93.50191497802734
22803/28840	Do you possess that right over Bertuccio  	59.66298294067383
22804/28840	There are words which close a conversation with an iron door such was the counts	360.7953796386719
22805/28840	The whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirtytwo horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight	242.27159118652344
22806/28840	At midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful	70.5842056274414
22807/28840	The porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the counts	54.82175064086914
22808/28840	At half past two in the morning Morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were	113.8428955078125
22809/28840	The servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him Baptistin who rode in front attended the	96.35096740722656
22810/28840	Albert bathed took his supper and went to	58.30659866333008
22811/28840	All night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the	87.48693084716797
22812/28840	On rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small	112.78780364990234
22813/28840	Around the schooner lay a number of small fishingboats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their	224.02870178222656
22814/28840	There as in every spot where Monte Cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost	120.28852081298828
22815/28840	Albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the Englisheminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggishhave invented for	178.23451232910156
22816/28840	The day passed in pursuing those exercises in which Monte Cristo exce	132.20220947265625
22817/28840	They killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summerhouse overlooking the ocean and took tea in the	105.16368865966797
22818/28840	Towards the evening of the third	415.81524658203125
22819/28840	He was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience Monte Crist	38.739986419677734
22820/28840	40188m       Florentin here cried he starting up is my mother ill And he hastened to the	50.956573486328125
22821/28840	Monte Cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a	112.3641586303711
22822/28840	From whom is this said he	177.72174072265625
22823/28840	Did he send you   Yes sir he sent for me to his house gave me money for my journey procured a horse and made me promise not to stop till I had reached you I have come in fifteen	91.18773651123047
22824/28840	Albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the	113.50045013427734
22825/28840	His sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not Florentin supported	110.93324279785156
22826/28840	Poor young man said Monte Cristo in a low voice it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth	39.94233703613281
22827/28840	Meanwhile Albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying   Florentin is your horse fit to return immediately   It is a poor lame post	78.77745056152344
22828/28840	In what state was the house when you left   All was quiet but on returning from	119.01223754882812
22829/28840	Beauchamps I found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would	89.36930847167969
22830/28840	I told her my orders from	209.66299438476562
22831/28840	Beauchamp she first extended her arms to prevent me but after a moments reflection Yes go Florentin said she and may he come	189.7065887451172
22832/28840	Yes my mother said Albert I will return and woe to the infamous wretch But first of all I must get	68.04304504394531
22833/28840	He went back to the room where he had left Monte Crist	19.567407608032227
22834/28840	Five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his	54.61429214477539
22835/28840	His voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the blueveined lids and he tottered like a drunken	132.61557006835938
22836/28840	Count said he I thank you for your hospitality which I would gladly have enjoyed longer but I must return to	62.147605895996094
22837/28840	What has happened   A great misfortune more important to me than	58.466712951660156
22838/28840	Dont question me I beg of you but lend me a	98.02230834960938
22839/28840	My stables are at your command viscount but you will kill yourself by riding on horse	92.36585235595703
22840/28840	No it would delay me and I need the fatigue you warn me of it will do me	116.96967315673828
22841/28840	Albert reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a chair near the	32.37675857543945
22842/28840	Monte Cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling   Ali a horse for	129.31820678710938
22843/28840	de Morcerfquick he is in a hurry   40190m       These words restored Albert he darted from the room followed by the	21.139785766601562
22844/28840	Thank you cried he throwing himself on his	86.4695816040039
22845/28840	Return as soon as you can Florent	54.1361198425293
22846/28840	Must I use any password to procure a horse   Only dismount another will be immediately sadd	188.92393493652344
22847/28840	You may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate	102.8859634399414
22848/28840	Read that said he when I am gone that you may not be witness of my	53.377220153808594
22849/28840	While the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an	50.8353271484375
22850/28840	He now calls himself the Count of Morcerf and ranks among the	68.603759765625
22851/28840	The Trial   At eight oclock in the morning Albert had arrived at Beauchamps	44.86177062988281
22852/28840	The valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at	36.364017486572266
22853/28840	Well my poor friend replied Beauchamp I expected	30.430078506469727
22854/28840	I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful	83.76416015625
22855/28840	Your having sent for me is another proof of your	93.67806243896484
22856/28840	So without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds   I think I have some cle	86.9099349975586
22857/28840	But first tell me all the particulars of this shameful	75.64665222167969
22858/28840	Beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following	77.96048736572266
22859/28840	Two days previously the article had appeared in another paper besides _ lImpartial_ and what was more serious one that was well known as a government	148.7169952392578
22860/28840	Beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the	158.46128845214844
22861/28840	He sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publishers	53.9228630065918
22862/28840	Although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper Beauchampas it sometimes we may say often happenswas his intimate	147.47933959960938
22863/28840	The editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beetsugar probably a composition of his	287.8621520996094
22864/28840	Ah _pardieu_ said Beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend I need not tell you the cause of my	26.262449264526367
22865/28840	Are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial	275.3313293457031
22866/28840	No replied Beauchamp I have not considered the question a totally different subject interests	155.57229614257812
22867/28840	What is it   The article relative to Morcer	21.029151916503906
22868/28840	Indeed Is it not a curious affair   So curious that I think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of	88.30012512207031
22869/28840	Not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure	89.00416564941406
22870/28840	de Morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to ones country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on	126.7024917602539
22871/28840	Who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing	110.00856018066406
22872/28840	de Morcerf as he is a peer of France and we are of the	38.65535354614258
22873/28840	Oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandal	81.82107543945312
22874/28840	A man arrived yesterday from Yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other	184.46878051757812
22875/28840	Beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to Morcer	101.3695297241211
22876/28840	But he had been unable to send to Albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the House of Peers among the usually calm members of that dignified	99.15369415283203
22877/28840	Everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious	91.32345581054688
22878/28840	Some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still	351.6705017089844
22879/28840	The Count of Morcerf was no favorite with his	41.35982894897461
22880/28840	Like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his	116.0146484375
22881/28840	The true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised	676.8071899414062
22882/28840	He was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice the finger of God once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and	158.28955078125
22883/28840	The Count of Morcerf alone was ignorant of the	33.938262939453125
22884/28840	He did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a	173.83238220214844
22885/28840	He arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the doorkeepers or the coolness of his	52.7214241027832

22889/28840	There was an impressive silence Morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complac	140.0277557373047

22891/28840	The article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his	197.20240783691406

22899/28840	The count was asked what time he required to prepare his	207.9769287109375
22900/28840	Morcerfs courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible	253.3692169189453
22901/28840	My lords answered he it is not by time I could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that I must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled	155.13079833984375

22925/28840	He held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the	97.77218627929688
22926/28840	The committee was made up of Liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with	197.1144256591797
22927/28840	Albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully	117.60523223876953
22928/28840	At this moment one of the doorkeepers brought in a letter for the	67.33715057373047
22929/28840	You are at liberty to speak	75.76358032226562
22930/28840	de Morcerf said the president as he unsealed the letter and the count began his defence I assure you Albert in a most eloquent and skilful	41.11581039428711
22931/28840	He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the	95.94792175292969
22932/28840	He produced the ring his mark of authority with which Ali Pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the ha	95.30035400390625

22935/28840	Albert started on hearing these words the history of Haydée recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a	45.57093811035156
22936/28840	And what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired	496.4706115722656
22937/28840	I acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said Beauch	124.45154571533203
22938/28840	Meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him but the first lines aroused his attention he read them again and again and fixing his eyes on	67.61307525634766

22945/28840	Can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have assertedAlas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away I know not	80.60196685791016
22946/28840	I believe that I alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful	139.7847137451172
22947/28840	A murmur of approbation ran through the assembly and at this moment Albert had nothing more transpired your fathers cause had been	87.7967300415039
22948/28840	It only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed Gentlemen and you monsieuryou will not be displeased I presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented	73.11392974853516
22949/28840	He is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our	153.01634216308594

22956/28840	I was present during his last	115.00576782226562

22959/28840	I shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to	57.14973831176758
22960/28840	And who is this witness or rather this enemy asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible	58.89833068847656
22961/28840	We shall know sir replied the	99.37269592285156
22962/28840	Is the committee willing to hear this witnessYes yes they all said at	366.8975830078125
22963/28840	Is there anyone in the lobby said the	85.71573638916016
22964/28840	Who is itA woman accompanied by a	410.2245178222656
22965/28840	Five minutes after the doorkeeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and I said Beauchamp shared the general expectation and	73.62042999267578
22966/28840	Behind the doorkeeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed	132.240478515625
22967/28840	It was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was	62.629119873046875
22968/28840	The president requested her to throw aside her veil and it was then seen that she was dressed in the Grecian costume and was remarkably	105.35787963867188
22969/28840	Who told you that   Alas I guess	48.14211654663086
22970/28840	You see I am calm and	220.40480041503906
22971/28840	And yet we must be drawing near the	181.6459197998047
22972/28840	de Morcerf continued Beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and	31.89217185974121
22973/28840	Her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or	165.5282440185547
22974/28840	To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the counts safety became now quite a secondary	195.06002807617188
22975/28840	The president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady but she declined availing herself of	156.1242218017578
22976/28840	As for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support	50.83933639526367
22977/28840	Madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at Yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the	74.33088684082031
22978/28840	I was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the	67.21973419189453
22979/28840	But allow me to say that you must have been very young	37.301963806152344
22980/28840	I was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my	118.50914001464844
22981/28840	In what manner could these events concern you and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on youOn them depended my fathers life replied	147.79107666015625
22982/28840	I am Haydée the daughter of Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and of Vasiliki his beloved	14.65439510345459
22983/28840	40202m       The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the	66.09130096435547
22984/28840	As for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before	59.56602096557617
22985/28840	A greenish pallor spread over the counts cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous	145.55731201171875
22986/28840	Haydée still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in	139.83499145507812
22987/28840	It had been supposed some of the papers might be in the Arabian Romaic or Turkish language and the interpreter of the House was in	72.46277618408203
22988/28840	The abovementioned purchase was made on his highnesss account whose mandate I had for the sum of four hundred thousand franc	78.39949035644531
22989/28840	Given at Constantinople by authority of his highness in the year 1247 of the Heg	125.65804290771484

22991/28840	Near the merchants signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime	226.23388671875
22992/28840	A dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on Haydée seemed one of fire and	124.11327362060547
22993/28840	Madame said the president may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo who is now I believe in Paris   Sir replied Haydée the Count of Monte Cristo my fosterfather has been in Normandy the last three	25.954124450683594
22994/28840	Although a Christian may God forgive me I have always sought to revenge my illustrious	99.60858154296875
22995/28840	Since I set my foot in France and knew the traitor lived in Paris I have watched	217.97488403320312
22996/28840	I live retired in the house of my noble protector but I do it from	115.2882080078125
22997/28840	I love retirement and silence because I can live with my thoughts and recollections of past	155.69964599609375
22998/28840	But the Count of Monte Cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in the	46.851341247558594
22999/28840	40204m       Then remarked the president the Count of Monte Cristo knows nothing of your present proceedingsHe is quite unaware of them and I have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what I have	40.380043029785156
23000/28840	But it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which I find at last an opportunity of avenging my father   The count had not uttered one word the whole of this	45.18224334716797
23001/28840	His colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a	125.34021759033203
23002/28840	His misery was depicted in sinister lines on his count	167.3284912109375
23003/28840	de Morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali Tepelini pasha of YaninaNo said Morcerf attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my	32.26814651489258
23004/28840	Haydée whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked You do not know me said	73.01362609863281
23005/28840	de Morcerf as the officer Fernand MondegoIndeed I do cried Hayd	34.64650344848633

23007/28840	This scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused	374.06317138671875
23008/28840	Count of Morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down	37.77839660644531
23009/28840	The justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of God it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending	101.27188110351562
23010/28840	Shall further inquiries be made Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina Speak Morcerf did not	174.2175750732422
23011/28840	Then all the members looked at each other with	45.309234619140625
23012/28840	They knew the counts energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend	116.01254272460938
23013/28840	They expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery	68.6640396118164
23014/28840	Well asked the president what is your decision   40206m       I have no reply to make said the count in a low	12.980642318725586
23015/28840	Has the daughter of Ali Tepelini spoken the truth said the	21.846885681152344
23016/28840	Is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead Not guilty Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused The count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his	101.55438995361328
23017/28840	Then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named	194.00949096679688
23018/28840	Gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the Count of Morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this HouseYes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous	114.92353820800781
23019/28840	Haydée had remained until the close of the	103.59075164794922
23020/28840	She heard the counts sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which Virgil attributes to his goddess	106.03662872314453
23021/28840	The Challenge   Then continued Beauchamp I took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being	41.40115737915039
23022/28840	The usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the Rue de Vaugir	80.30924987792969

23033/28840	Thank you my dear Beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice but it cannot	56.69331741333008
23034/28840	I have told you my wish or rather my	74.198974609375
23035/28840	You understand that interested as I am in this affair I cannot see it in the same light as you	45.844234466552734
23036/28840	What appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less	154.39341735839844
23037/28840	Now I repeat Beauchamp I wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the	88.62796783447266
23038/28840	Be it so said Beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth I submit and if you will seek your enemy I will assist you and I will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as	67.17442321777344
23039/28840	Well then you understand Beauchamp that we begin our search	150.76943969726562
23040/28840	Each moments delay is an eternity for	371.2210388183594
23041/28840	The calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives	88.45242309570312
23042/28840	Ah Beauchamp I see you know something already you will restore me to	54.88323974609375
23043/28840	I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of light in a dark night by following it we may perhaps discover something more	49.4449348449707
23044/28840	Well I will tell you what I did not like to mention on my return from Yan	26.216766357421875
23045/28840	I went of course to the chief banker of the town to make	149.1485595703125
23046/28840	At the first word before I had even mentioned your fathers name   Ah said	52.516868591308594
23047/28840	How and why   Because a fortnight since I was questioned on the same	69.8872299194336
23048/28840	By whom   By a banker of Paris my	152.0576934814453
23049/28840	He cried Albert yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous	111.38436889648438
23050/28840	He the man who would be popular cannot forgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being assignedyes it is all from the same	85.89376068115234
23051/28840	Make inquiries Albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be true   Oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all I have	53.867774963378906
23052/28840	Beware Morcerf he is already an old	62.71249771118164
23053/28840	I will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally Oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to	118.78874206542969
23054/28840	I do not condemn you Albert I only restrain	78.29364776611328
23055/28840	Oh do not fear besides you will accompany	33.464866638183594
23056/28840	Beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a	281.9204406738281
23057/28840	Danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or I shall	46.56997299194336
23058/28840	_Pardieu_ Beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral   When such resolutions are made Albert they should be promptly	137.7078857421875
23059/28840	Do you wish to go to	29.06687355041504
23060/28840	On entering the bankers mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of	131.94419860839844
23061/28840	Ah _parbleu_ thats good said Albert with a gloomy	36.39344787597656
23062/28840	Danglars will not fight with me I will kill his soninlaw Cavalcanti will certainly	28.63334846496582
23063/28840	The servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him	96.14476776123047
23064/28840	It was however too late Albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by Beauchamp found himself in the bankers	66.32716369628906
23065/28840	Sir cried the latter am I no longer at liberty to receive whom I choose in my house You appear to forget yourself	87.55353546142578
23066/28840	No sir said Albert coldly there are circumstances in which one cannot except through cowardiceI offer you that refugerefuse to admit certain persons at	273.7371520996094
23067/28840	Danglars turned pale Cavalcanti moved a step forward and Albert turned towards	52.3443489074707
23068/28840	And you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one of the family and I will give as many rendezvous of that kind as I can find persons willing to accept	57.94404602050781
23069/28840	Cavalcanti looked at Danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young	50.983795166015625
23070/28840	Alberts attack on Andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first	134.11279296875
23071/28840	Indeed sir said he to Albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because I have preferred him to you I shall resign the case to the kings	53.88958740234375
23072/28840	You mistake sir said Morcerf with a gloomy smile I am not referring in the least to matrimony and I only addressed myself to	36.61754608154297
23073/28840	Cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between	388.549072265625
23074/28840	In one respect you are right for I am ready to quarrel with everyone today but you have the first claim	93.77710723876953
23075/28840	Now if you are mad and try to bite me I will kill you without	58.121009826660156
23076/28840	Is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself   Yes miserable wretch cried Morcerf it is your	45.76631546020508
23077/28840	My fault said he you must be mad What do I know of the Grecian affair Have I travelled in that country Did I advise your father to sell the castle of Yaninato betray   Silence said Albert with a thundering	97.6661376953125
23078/28840	No it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked	206.5968017578125
23079/28840	I   Yes you How came it known   I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina   Who wrote to Yanina   To Yanina  	40.00163269042969
23080/28840	Who wrote for particulars concerning my father   I imagine anyone may write to Yan	120.96488952636719
23081/28840	But one person only wrote   One only   Yes and that was you   I doubtless	89.188720703125
23082/28840	It appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a	63.10931396484375
23083/28840	You wrote sir knowing what answer you would	400.9774169921875
23084/28840	Who then urged you to write Tell	237.19578552246094
23085/28840	_Pardieu_ it was the most simple thing in the	44.41029357910156
23086/28840	I was speaking of your fathers past	167.3592071533203
23087/28840	I said the origin of his fortune remained	163.48443603515625
23088/28840	The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property I answered In	182.27566528320312
23089/28840	And who thus advised you   No other than your friend Monte Crist	76.35481262207031
23090/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina   Yes and I wrote and will show you my correspondence if you	29.43047523498535
23091/28840	Albert and Beauchamp looked at each	9.070674896240234
23092/28840	Sir said Beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from Paris at this moment and cannot justify	39.19164276123047
23093/28840	I accuse no one sir said Danglars I relate and I will repeat before the count what I have said to	39.58470916748047
23094/28840	Does the count know what answer you received   Yes I showed it to	60.32659149169922
23095/28840	Did he know my fathers Christian name was Fernand and his family name Mondego   Yes I had told him that long since and I did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps	68.93156433105469
23096/28840	When the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of Monte Cristo to ask my daughters hand for you I decidedly refused him but without any explanation or	83.9127197265625
23097/28840	In short why should I have any more to do with the affair How did the honor or disgrace of	92.94050598144531
23098/28840	de Morcerf affect me It neither increased nor decreased my	213.063232421875
23099/28840	Albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the	99.6994400024414
23100/28840	Danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not whollynot for conscience sake but through	81.03446960449219
23101/28840	In addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his	352.9952392578125
23102/28840	Monte Cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha and knowing everything he had advised Danglars to write to Yan	59.646934509277344
23103/28840	Besides had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his fathers name before Haydée Lastly he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was	85.49290466308594
23104/28840	There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged Monte Cristo then was in league with his fathers	92.20857238769531
23105/28840	Albert took Beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to	121.12349700927734
23106/28840	You are right said the latter	66.86839294433594
23107/28840	Danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of	57.73207092285156
23108/28840	de Monte Cristo that you must demand an	40.1677131652832
23109/28840	Sir said he to Danglars understand that I do not take a final leave of you I must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Crist	43.55116653442383
23110/28840	He bowed to the banker and went out with Beauchamp without appearing to notice Cavalc	42.20363235473633
23111/28840	Danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the Count of Morcer	45.92788314819336
23112/28840	The Insult   At the bankers door Beauchamp stopped Morcer	89.25743103027344
23113/28840	Listen said he just now I told you it was of	62.28264617919922
23114/28840	de Monte Cristo you must demand an	52.94258499145508
23115/28840	Yes and we are going to his	26.553783416748047
23116/28840	Reflect Morcerf one moment before you	158.69085693359375
23117/28840	On what shall I reflect   On the importance of the step you are	91.27991485595703
23118/28840	Is it more serious than going to	179.85304260253906
23119/28840	Danglars is a moneylover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a	141.479736328125
23120/28840	The other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fear to find him a bully   I only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not	58.39346694946289
23121/28840	Do not be alarmed said Beauchamp he will meet	44.12256622314453
23122/28840	My only fear is that he will be too strong for	62.459129333496094
23123/28840	My friend said Morcerf with a sweet smile that is what I	19.87074851989746
23124/28840	The happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead that would save us	130.4833221435547
23125/28840	My poor mother said Albert passing his hand across his eyes I know she would but better so than die of	116.7451171875
23126/28840	Are you quite decided Albert   Yes let us	59.95461654663086
23127/28840	But do you think we shall find the count at home   He intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at	80.83135986328125
23128/28840	They ordered the driver to take them to	120.08203887939453
23129/28840	Beauchamp wished to go in alone but Albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of du	126.00761413574219
23130/28840	The cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following Morcer	59.369590759277344
23131/28840	Albert sprang from the porters lodge to the	45.910003662109375
23132/28840	The count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be	111.61128234863281
23133/28840	And after dinner   He will sleep an	83.36493682861328
23134/28840	Then   He is going to the	19.039541244506836
23135/28840	Are you sure of it asked	78.98352813720703
23136/28840	Quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight oclock	88.06713104248047
23137/28840	Very good replied Albert that is all I wished to	46.612060546875
23138/28840	Then turning towards Beauchamp If you have anything to attend to Beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till	56.78007507324219
23139/28840	I depend on you to accompany me to the Opera and if you can bring ChâteauRenaud with	27.531320571899414
23140/28840	Beauchamp availed himself of Alberts permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before	122.7890396118164
23141/28840	On his return home Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray and Morrel to see them at the Opera that	64.82438659667969
23142/28840	Then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone and had kept her	71.68162536621094
23143/28840	He found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public	193.16773986816406
23144/28840	The sight of Albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on Mercédès she pressed her sons hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved	143.1588592529297
23145/28840	Albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mothers	205.04029846191406
23146/28840	It was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing	121.04006958007812
23147/28840	My dear mother said he do you know if	38.871437072753906
23148/28840	de Morcerf has any enemy   Mercédès started she noticed that the young man did not say my	26.047412872314453
23149/28840	My son she said persons in the counts situation have many secret	346.8155212402344
23150/28840	Those who are known are not the most	169.04502868652344
23151/28840	I know it and appeal to your	113.04733276367188
23152/28840	You are of so superior a mind nothing escapes	352.4862976074219
23153/28840	Why do you say so   Because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that	53.96232986450195
23154/28840	de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our	57.24227523803711
23155/28840	Mercédès raised herself on her feverish	43.0588493347168
23156/28840	de Monte Cristo she exclaimed and how is he connected with the question you asked me   40219m       You know mother	29.24750328063965
23157/28840	de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental and it is customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their	102.5404281616211
23158/28840	de Monte Cristo is our enemy replied Mercédès becoming paler than the sheet which covered	30.178680419921875
23159/28840	Who told you so Why you are mad Albert	243.4134521484375
23160/28840	de Monte Cristo has only shown us	295.6817932128906
23161/28840	de Monte Cristo saved your life you yourself presented him to	119.09710693359375
23162/28840	Oh I entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it and my counsel to younay my prayeris to retain his	87.4852294921875
23163/28840	Mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that	76.14051818847656
23164/28840	I said Mercédès blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than	33.41041946411133
23165/28840	Yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm   Mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze You speak strangely said she to Albert and you appear to have some singular	57.7188835144043
23166/28840	What has the count done Three days since you were with him in Normandy only three days since we looked on him as our best	95.71729278564453
23167/28840	An ironical smile passed over Alberts	51.64065170288086
23168/28840	Mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strongminded she concealed both her sorrows and her	88.28874969482422
23169/28840	Albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed   You came to inquire after my health I will candidly acknowledge that I am not	82.13672637939453
23170/28840	You should install yourself here and cheer my	322.03387451171875
23171/28840	I do not wish to be left	17.825546264648438
23172/28840	Mother said the young man you know how gladly I would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole	80.62921905517578
23173/28840	Well replied Mercédès sighing go Albert I will not make you a slave to your filial	69.44342803955078
23174/28840	Albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his mother and quitted	87.12138366699219
23175/28840	Scarcely had he shut her door when Mercédès called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow Albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he	95.15219116210938
23176/28840	Then she rang for her ladys maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might	104.86438751220703
23177/28840	The footmans mission was an easy	346.2434997558594
23178/28840	Albert went to his room and dressed with unusual	112.91835021972656
23179/28840	At ten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived he had seen ChâteauRenaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was	35.70875930786133
23180/28840	Both got into Alberts _coupé_ and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud To the	38.61219024658203
23181/28840	In his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the	71.63423156738281
23182/28840	40221m       ChâteauRenaud was at his post apprised by Beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from	28.5657901763916
23183/28840	The conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that ChâteauRenaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of	71.16949462890625
23184/28840	Debray was not yet come but Albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the	103.50572967529297
23185/28840	Albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn	141.75546264648438

23187/28840	The bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with ChâteauRenaud and Beauch	27.096282958984375
23188/28840	But his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first	88.47347259521484
23189/28840	At last as Albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and Monte Cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the	51.562469482421875
23190/28840	Morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother inlaw he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to	115.74114227294922
23191/28840	The count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his	143.3839569091797
23192/28840	He recognized Albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomp	149.76515197753906
23193/28840	Without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his operaglass and looked another	126.72435760498047
23194/28840	Although apparently not noticing Albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two	51.919151306152344
23195/28840	Then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on	59.480159759521484
23196/28840	He was at the moment conversing cheerfully with Morrel but he was well prepared for what might	75.89895629882812
23197/28840	The door opened and Monte Cristo turning round saw Albert pale and trembling followed by Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	18.637287139892578
23198/28840	Well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his	94.35676574707031
23199/28840	The countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordial	97.6468505859375
23200/28840	Morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the Opera but he understood that something terrible was bro	73.61814880371094
23201/28840	We are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said Albert but to demand an	162.70907592773438
23202/28840	The young mans trembling voice was scarcely	161.56068420410156
23203/28840	An explanation at the Opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is	77.05508422851562
23204/28840	Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians I should not have thought this the place for such a	73.62496185302734
23205/28840	Still if people will shut themselves up said Albert and cannot be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be	130.6043243408203
23206/28840	I am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my	92.96931457519531
23207/28840	Yesterday I was at your house sir said the young man because then I knew not who you	49.776832580566406
23208/28840	In pronouncing these words Albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the	70.57986450195312
23209/28840	Thus the attention of many was attracted by this	138.8689727783203
23210/28840	Where are you come from sir  said Monte Cristo You do not appear to be in the possession of your	37.59844970703125
23211/28840	Provided I understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that I will be revenged I shall be reasonable enough said Albert	118.56034851074219
23212/28840	I do not understand you sir replied Monte Cristo and if I did your tone is too	36.8486213684082
23213/28840	I am at home here and I alone have a right to raise my voice above another	86.86820983886719
23214/28840	Leave the box sir   Monte Cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding	57.067691802978516
23215/28840	Ah I shall know how to make you leave your home replied Albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which Monte Cristo did not lose sight	40.181427001953125
23216/28840	Well well said Monte Cristo quietly I see you wish to quarrel with me but I would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in	47.439414978027344
23217/28840	It is in poor taste to make a display of a	117.36160278320312
23218/28840	Display is not becoming to everyone	435.50970458984375
23219/28840	At this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this	84.90707397460938
23220/28840	They had talked of no one but Morcerf the whole	54.56135940551758
23221/28840	Albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when Morrel seized his hand while Beauchamp and ChâteauRenaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him	38.92732620239258
23222/28840	Now leave me or I will summon my servants to throw you out at the	82.84810638427734
23223/28840	Wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed Albert stepped back and Morrel closed the	111.477783203125
23224/28840	Monte Cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like	124.74712371826172
23225/28840	Morrel whispered What have you done to him   I Nothingat least personally said Monte Crist	67.86103820800781
23226/28840	But there must be some cause for this strange	68.34552001953125
23227/28840	The Count of Morcerfs adventure exasperates the young	55.191734313964844
23228/28840	Have you anything to do with it   It was through Haydée that the Chamber was informed of his fathers	43.69024658203125
23229/28840	I had been told but would not credit it that the Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of Ali P	54.07740783691406
23230/28840	Then said Morrel I understand it all and this scene was premed	58.23280334472656
23231/28840	Albert wrote to request me to come to the Opera doubtless that I might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer	74.03685760498047
23232/28840	Probably said Monte Cristo with his imperturbable tranquill	9.16131591796875
23233/28840	But what shall you do with him   With whom   With	30.915376663208008
23234/28840	What shall I do with Albert As certainly Maximilian as I now press your hand I shall kill him before ten oclock tomorrow	73.3614273071289
23235/28840	Morrel in his turn took Monte Cristos hand in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it	79.04769134521484
23236/28840	Ah count said he his father loves him so much   Do not speak to me of that said Monte Cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed I will make him	52.85020446777344
23237/28840	Morrel amazed let fall Monte Cristos	245.67164611816406
23238/28840	Dear Maximilian interrupted the count listen how adorably Duprez is singing that line   O Mathilde idole de mon âme     I was the first to discover Duprez at Naples and the first to applaud	86.2997055053711
23239/28840	Bravo bravo   Morrel saw it was useless to say more and ref	115.97350311279297
23240/28840	The curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with Albert again fell and a rap was heard at the	93.29914093017578
23241/28840	Come in said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion and immediately Beauchamp	73.12278747558594
23242/28840	Beauchamp said Monte Cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be	47.00673294067383
23243/28840	Beauchamp bowed and sitting down Sir said he I just now accompanied	173.2312469482422
23244/28840	And that means replied Monte Cristo laughing that you had probably just dined	80.46234130859375
23245/28840	Beauchamp that you are more sober than he	66.80914306640625
23246/28840	Beauchamp Albert was wrong I acknowledge to betray so much anger and I come on my own account to apologize for	146.86061096191406
23247/28840	And having done so entirely on my own account be it understood I would add that I believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with Yan	130.2163543701172
23248/28840	Then I will add two words about the young Greek	140.20118713378906
23249/28840	Monte Cristo motioned him to be	129.1036834716797
23250/28840	Come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be	76.16154479980469
23251/28840	Doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric	296.71099853515625
23252/28840	I am in your opinion a Lara a Manfred a Lord Ruthven then just as I am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of	98.56295013427734
23253/28840	You bring me down to your own level and demand explanations Indeed	193.93431091308594
23254/28840	Yet replied Beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity commands  	68.81754302978516
23255/28840	Beauchamp interposed this strange man the Count of Monte Cristo bows to none but the Count of Monte Cristo	33.70149230957031
23256/28840	Beauchamp and it is always well	113.30502319335938
23257/28840	Sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such	37.47367858886719
23258/28840	I am sir a living guaranty replied Monte Cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shedthat is our mutual guarant	78.15567779541016
23259/28840	Tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten oclock I shall see what color his	86.05265808105469
23260/28840	Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel said Beauch	48.91278076171875
23261/28840	It is quite immaterial to me said Monte Cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the Opera for such a tr	31.71731948852539

23263/28840	Sure to gain repeated Beauchamp looking with amazement at the	66.80152893066406
23264/28840	Certainly said Monte Cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders otherwise I would not fight with	35.26527786254883
23265/28840	I shall kill himI cannot help	91.41193389892578
23266/28840	Only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour I do not like to be kept	74.46288299560547
23267/28840	Pistols then at eight oclock in the Bois de Vincennes said Beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural	78.86817932128906
23268/28840	Now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your friend Albert not to come any more this evening he will hurt himself with all his illchosen barbarisms let him go home and go to	116.46638488769531
23269/28840	Now said Monte Cristo turning towards Morrel I may depend upon you may I not   Certainly said Morrel I am at your service count still   What   It is desirable I should know the real	27.257972717285156
23270/28840	That is to say you would rather not  	45.150264739990234
23271/28840	The young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to God and to me but I give you my word Morrel that God who does know it will be on our	84.62627410888672
23272/28840	Enough said Morrel who is your second witness   I know no one in Paris Morrel on whom I could confer that honor besides you and your brother	74.837890625
23273/28840	Do you think Emmanuel would oblige me   I will answer for him	54.099082946777344

23276/28840	The Night   Monte Cristo waited according to his usual custom until Duprez had sung his famous _Suivezmoi_ then he rose and went	87.97445678710938
23277/28840	Morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven oclock and to bring	82.36931610107422
23278/28840	Then he stepped into his _coupé_ calm and smiling and was at home in five	33.72482681274414
23279/28840	No one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said   Ali bring me my pistols with the ivory	137.26007080078125
23280/28840	Ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and	80.38545227050781
23281/28840	These were pistols of an especial pattern which Monte Cristo had had made for target practice in his own	60.2026481628418
23282/28840	A cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand	134.7909698486328
23283/28840	He was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and Baptistin	100.20841217041016
23284/28840	Before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after Baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed	67.0918960571289
23285/28840	Baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after	57.05106735229492
23286/28840	Who are you madame said the count to the veiled	45.97647476196289
23287/28840	What name did you pronounce then Madame de Morcerf said	41.08429718017578
23288/28840	Yours cried she throwing back her veilyours which I alone perhaps have not	280.0645751953125
23289/28840	Edmond it is not Madame de Morcerf who is come to you it is Mercédè	18.14935302734375
23290/28840	Mercédès is dead madame said Monte Cristo I know no one now of that	20.10829734802246
23291/28840	Fernand do you mean replied Monte Cristo with bitter irony since we are recalling names let us remember them	57.67329788208008
23292/28840	Monte Cristo had pronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that Mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every	72.79669952392578
23293/28840	You see Edmond I am not mistaken and have cause to say Spare my son   And who told you madame that I have any hostile intentions against your son   No one in truth but a mother has twofold	74.70914459228516
23294/28840	I guessed all I followed him this evening to the Opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen	143.04844665527344
23295/28840	If you have seen all madame you know that the son of Fernand has publicly insulted me said Monte Cristo with awful calm	48.349998474121094
23296/28840	Oh for pitys sake   You have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if Morrel one of my friends had not stopped	45.69444274902344
23297/28840	Listen to me my son has also guessed who you arehe attributes his fathers misfortunes to	70.60803985595703
23298/28840	Madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunesit is a	37.58915710449219
23299/28840	It is not I who strike	151.62168884277344
23300/28840	de Morcerf it is Providence which punishes	77.1158447265625
23301/28840	And why do you represent Providence cried Mercédè	29.233518600463867
23302/28840	It does not concern me you are right and if I have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the French captain or the Count of Morcerf but on the fisherman Fernand the husband of Mercédès the Catal	28.223880767822266
23303/28840	Ah sir cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commitfor I am the only culprit Edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my	98.04208374023438
23304/28840	But exclaimed Monte Cristo why was I absent And why were you alone   40231m       Because you had been arrested Edmond and were a	31.835281372070312
23305/28840	And why was I arrested Why was I a prisoner   I do not know said Mercédè	36.69474411010742
23306/28840	You do not madame at least I hope	34.73566436767578
23307/28840	I was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of La Réserve the day before I was to marry you a man named Danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman Fernand himself	55.246925354003906
23308/28840	Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned Edmond Dantès who either carries the letter for Paris about with him or has it at his fathers ab	60.945674896240234
23309/28840	Should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the _Pharaon	29.06060791015625
23310/28840	And the result of that letter   You well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest	70.98697662353516
23311/28840	You do not know that I remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the Château d	26.190122604370117
23312/28840	That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had entered it and that is why on account of the living Mercédès and my deceased father I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand andI have revenged	71.6848373413086
23313/28840	Compared with such things what is the letter you have just reada lovers deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married	147.5675506591797

23318/28840	Her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised	240.98129272460938
23319/28840	Then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of Monte Cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening	75.39773559570312
23320/28840	Mercédès I must revenge myself for I suffered fourteen yearsfourteen years I wept I cursed now I tell you Mercédès I must revenge	49.90401077270508
23321/28840	The count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his	74.32882690429688
23322/28840	Since God himself dictated those words to his prophet why should I seek to make myself better than God   Edmond continued Mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since I first knew you I have adored your name have respected your	65.24137878417969
23323/28840	Edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my	134.7887725830078
23324/28840	Mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that Monte Cristo could not restrain a	35.571022033691406
23325/28840	The lion was daunted the avenger was	495.230712890625

23327/28840	Oh now I may say so   So much the better replied Monte Cristo as that poor Edmond will not have long to be loved by	31.269567489624023
23328/28840	Death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in	144.53326416015625

23333/28840	Mercédès shrieked and sprang towards Monte Cristo but suddenly stopping Edmond said she there is a God above us since you live and since I have seen you again I trust to him from my	44.19084930419922
23334/28840	While waiting his assistance I trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not   Yes madame he shall live said Monte Cristo surprised that without more emotion Mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for	59.85009765625
23335/28840	Mercédès extended her hand to the	15.214371681213379
23336/28840	Ah believe me Edmond as I told you I too have suffered much I repeat it is melancholy to pass ones life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope but that proves that all is not yet	104.1606674194336
23337/28840	No it is not finished I feel it by what remains in my	75.3037109375
23338/28840	Oh I repeat it Edmond what you have just done is beautifulit is grand it is	75.21331024169922
23339/28840	Mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her	40.394813537597656
23340/28840	Monte Cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its	117.9172134399414
23341/28840	Edmond said Mercédès I have but one word more to say to	20.142383575439453
23342/28840	Edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if Mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the	97.54605865478516
23343/28840	Adieu then Edmond I have nothing more to ask of heavenI have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you	108.89513397216797
23344/28840	Mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged	50.99179458618164
23345/28840	The clock of the Invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed Madame de Morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the ChampsÉlysées and made Monte Cristo raise his	35.21558380126953
23346/28840	The Meeting   After Mercédès had left Monte Cristo he fell into profound	44.97361755371094
23347/28840	Around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme	233.90110778808594
23348/28840	No it is not existence then that I regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously	203.78018188476562
23349/28840	Providence is now opposed to them when I most thought it would be prop	278.8958435058594
23350/28840	It is not Gods will that they should be	75.92302703857422
23351/28840	This burden almost as heavy as a world which I had raised and I had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my	81.75653076171875
23352/28840	There are virtues which become crimes by	952.8667602539062
23353/28840	No she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear	207.52964782714844
23354/28840	The blush of pride mounted to the counts forehead as this thought passed through his	173.21571350097656
23355/28840	Ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on	519.0045166015625
23356/28840	I ridiculous No I would rather	130.83383178710938
23357/28840	Seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in Paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his	96.7781753540039
23358/28840	I do this Oh my God said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for	114.64910125732422
23359/28840	I have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like Morcerf Danglars Villefort even Morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their	80.6143798828125
23360/28840	Let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by Providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for	108.69810485839844
23361/28840	While he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertaintieswretched waking dreams of griefthe first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of	177.7428436279297
23362/28840	It was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his	37.520668029785156
23363/28840	He turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its	89.18251037597656
23364/28840	He arose and quietly opening the door of the drawingroom saw Haydée who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown	62.608158111572266
23365/28840	She had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young cannot resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with	203.82984924316406
23366/28840	The noise of the door did not awaken her and Monte Cristo gazed at her with affectionate	65.89620208740234
23367/28840	She remembered that she had a son said he and I forgot I had a	71.41213989257812
23368/28840	Then shaking his head sorrowfully Poor Haydée said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed	71.063720703125
23369/28840	Oh I cannot go without taking leave of her I cannot die without confiding her to	143.7672882080078
23370/28840	These twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at Monte Cristo of which Bertuccio knows the	51.09191131591797
23371/28840	40241m       He was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his	56.15580368041992
23372/28840	Well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled	56.41654586791992
23373/28840	Well if any misfortune happen to me replied Monte Cristo I wish my daughter to be	28.6992130279541
23374/28840	Haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her	84.73857879638672
23375/28840	Do you think of dying my lord said	51.38294219970703
23376/28840	The wise man my child has said It is good to think of	203.0130157470703
23377/28840	Well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die I shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the	75.24186706542969
23378/28840	Then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the	158.7271728515625
23379/28840	Alas murmured he with intense suffering I might then have been happy	190.88394165039062
23380/28840	Then he carried Haydée to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed	119.93119049072266
23381/28840	As he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was	57.49747848510742
23382/28840	Monte Cristo approached the window and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel al	70.83948516845703
23383/28840	Good said he it was timeand he sealed his will with three	242.8599853515625
23384/28840	A moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawingroom and went to open the door	45.66147994995117
23385/28840	Morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time	159.27435302734375
23386/28840	I am perhaps come too soon count said he but I frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my	123.31201171875
23387/28840	I need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover	187.24636840820312
23388/28840	Monte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open	71.49121856689453
23389/28840	Morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that I am beloved by such a man as	38.059242248535156
23390/28840	Goodmorning Emmanuel you will come with me then Maximilian   Did you doubt it said the young	48.10322189331055
23391/28840	But if I were wrong   I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday I have been thinking of your firmness all night and I said to myself that justice must be on your side or mans countenance is no longer to be relied	68.31185913085938
23392/28840	But Morrel Albert is your friend   Simply an acquaintance	101.16353607177734
23393/28840	You met on the same day you first saw me   Yes that is true but I should not have recollected it if you had not reminded	37.009986877441406
23394/28840	said he to Ali who came immediately take that to my	260.00885009765625
23395/28840	When I am dead you will go and examine	59.1705436706543
23396/28840	What said Morrel you dead   Yes must I not be prepared for everything dear friend But what did you do yesterday after you left me   I went to Tortonis where as I expected I found Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	41.90616989135742
23397/28840	Why when all was arranged   Listen count the affair is serious and	216.78492736816406
23398/28840	Did you doubt it   No the offence was public and everyone is already talking of	116.13969421386719
23399/28840	Well   Well I hoped to get an exchange of armsto substitute the sword for the pistol the pistol is	192.0727081298828
23400/28840	Have you succeeded asked Monte Cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of	33.64313507080078
23401/28840	No for your skill with the sword is so well	68.75594329833984
23402/28840	Ahwho has betrayed me   The skilful swordsman whom you have	83.86471557617188
23403/28840	And you failed   They positively	261.65057373046875
23404/28840	Morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol  	76.35797882080078
23405/28840	Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when Mercédès entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the	79.49864959716797
23406/28840	He examined the bullets with which Monte Cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than bucks	74.29708099365234
23407/28840	Then turning towards Monte Cristo Count said he in the name of all that is dear to you I entreat you not to kill Albertthe unhappy youth has a	67.64293670654297
23408/28840	You are right said Monte Cristo and I have	14.515207290649414
23409/28840	These words were uttered in a tone which made Morrel	76.23261260986328
23410/28840	Doubtless what does that imply   That you will fire	212.34402465820312
23411/28840	I fire first   Oh I obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us	89.06822967529297
23412/28840	And at what distance   Twenty p	118.3110122680664
23413/28840	A smile of terrible import passed over the counts	138.22438049316406
23414/28840	Morrel said he do not forget what you have just	42.04237365722656
23415/28840	The only chance for Alberts safety then will arise from your	141.8466796875
23416/28840	I suffer from emotion said Monte Crist	83.25115966796875
23417/28840	Or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are I may say what would appear absurd to	151.60491943359375
23418/28840	What is that   Break his armwound himbut do not kill	121.85713195800781
23419/28840	I will tell you Morrel said the count that I do not need entreating to spare the life of	37.86008071899414
23420/28840	de Morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while I   And you   That will be another thing I shall be brought	44.89474868774414
23421/28840	No no cried Maximilian quite unable to restrain his	78.16353607177734
23422/28840	As I told you my dear Morrel	25.213632583618164
23423/28840	Morrel looked at him in utter amaz	100.88446807861328
23424/28840	But what has happened then since last evening count   The same thing that happened to Brutus the night before the battle of Philippi I have seen a	89.17383575439453
23425/28840	And that ghost   Told me Morrel that I had lived long	139.31195068359375
23426/28840	Maximilian and Emmanuel looked at each	32.72251510620117
23427/28840	Let us go said he it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eight o	66.04641723632812
23428/28840	A carriage was in readiness at the	57.390625
23429/28840	Monte Cristo stepped into it with his two	213.60818481445312
23430/28840	He had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and Maximilian and Emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from	85.33992004394531
23431/28840	As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of	97.46566772460938
23432/28840	We are first said Morrel looking out of the	48.088592529296875
23433/28840	Excuse me sir said Baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but I think I see a carriage down there under the	43.52162551879883
23434/28840	Monte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist Emmanuel and Maximil	101.54901123046875
23435/28840	The latter retained the counts hand between	213.21934509277344
23436/28840	I like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his	165.83168029785156
23437/28840	It seems to me said Emmanuel that I see two young men down there who are evidently	64.81124877929688
23438/28840	Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two behind his brotherin	179.31715393066406
23439/28840	Maximilian said he are your affections disengaged Morrel looked at Monte Cristo with aston	39.629425048828125
23440/28840	I do not seek your confidence my dear	38.32451629638672
23441/28840	I only ask you a simple question answer itthat is all I	156.861572265625
23442/28840	Do you love her much   More than my	93.95166015625
23443/28840	Then with a sigh Poor Haydée murmured	37.33234786987305
23444/28840	To tell the truth count if I knew less of you I should think that you were less brave than you	92.3921890258789
23445/28840	Because I sigh when thinking of someone I am leaving Come Morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of	106.17500305175781
23446/28840	Do I regret life What is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death Moreover do not alarm yourself Morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you	119.21602630615234
23447/28840	I know the world is a drawingroom from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor	118.67166137695312
23448/28840	Have you brought your arms   Iwhat for I hope these gentlemen have	123.45862579345703
23449/28840	Do but make no treatyyou understand me   You need not	82.88540649414062
23450/28840	Morrel advanced towards Beauchamp and ChâteauRenaud who seeing his intention came to meet	24.10003662109375
23451/28840	The three young men bowed to each other courteously if not aff	178.68075561523438
23452/28840	Excuse me gentlemen said Morrel but I do not see	36.9619255065918
23453/28840	He sent us word this morning replied ChâteauRenaud that he would meet us on the	40.876976013183594
23454/28840	It is only five minutes past eight said he to Morrel there is not much time lost	88.00311279296875
23455/28840	Oh I made no allusion of that kind replied Mor	62.31663131713867
23456/28840	There is a carriage coming said ChâteauRen	19.72795295715332
23457/28840	It advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were	151.6093292236328
23458/28840	You are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen	671.5357666015625
23459/28840	de Monte Cristo yields his right of using	123.75615692138672
23460/28840	We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said Beauchamp and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar	68.23600769042969
23461/28840	They are quite new and have not yet been	122.55944061279297
23462/28840	Beauchamp if you assure me that	96.16007995605469
23463/28840	de Morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite	59.75859069824219
23464/28840	Gentlemen said ChâteauRenaud it is not Morcerf coming in that carriagefaith it is Franz and Debray   The two young men he announced were indeed	45.63787078857422
23465/28840	What chance brings you here gentlemen said ChâteauRenaud shaking hands with each of	56.96986389160156
23466/28840	Because said Debray Albert sent this morning to request us to	103.88578033447266
23467/28840	Beauchamp and ChâteauRenaud exchanged looks of aston	23.472660064697266
23468/28840	I think I understand his reason said Mor	68.19857025146484
23469/28840	What is it   Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from	45.79481506347656
23470/28840	de Morcerf begging me to attend the	77.11550903320312
23471/28840	And we too added Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	14.318978309631348
23472/28840	Having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the	168.0844268798828
23473/28840	Exactly so said the young men you have probably guessed	141.34629821777344
23474/28840	But after all these arrangements he does not come himself said ChâteauRen	25.57614517211914
23475/28840	There he comes said Beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a	34.91652297973633
23476/28840	How imprudent said ChâteauRenaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions I had given	29.53626823425293
23477/28840	And besides said Beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat Why has he not painted a spot upon his heartit would have been more	74.29208374023438
23478/28840	Meanwhile Albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young	64.17945098876953
23479/28840	He jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servants arms and joined	114.18704223632812
23480/28840	He was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not	32.500850677490234
23481/28840	A shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to	91.5666732788086
23482/28840	I thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request I feel extremely grateful for this mark of	135.4530487060547
23483/28840	Morrel had stepped back as Morcerf approached and remained at a short	70.31857299804688
23484/28840	40248m       Sir said Maximilian you are not perhaps aware that I am	20.848703384399414
23485/28840	de Monte Cristos friend   I was not sure but I thought it might be	39.509761810302734
23486/28840	So much the better the more honorable men there are here the better I shall be	83.42008972167969
23487/28840	Morrel said ChâteauRenaud will you apprise the Count of Monte Cristo that	15.84417724609375
23488/28840	de Morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal   Morrel was preparing to fulfil his	42.48051834106445
23489/28840	Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the	141.86276245117188
23490/28840	Stop gentlemen said Albert I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Crist	17.768756866455078
23491/28840	No sir before all who are	195.0498046875
23492/28840	Franz and Debray exchanged some words in a whisper and Morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with	51.74362564086914
23493/28840	What does he want with me said Monte Crist	20.328611373901367
23494/28840	I do not know but he wishes to speak to	19.98306655883789
23495/28840	Ah said Monte Cristo I trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult   I do not think that such is his intention said Mor	31.779102325439453
23496/28840	The count advanced accompanied by Maximilian and	96.90696716308594
23497/28840	His calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to Alberts griefstricken face who approached also followed by the other four young	140.4547882080078
23498/28840	When at three paces distant from each other Albert and the count	88.96458435058594
23499/28840	Sir said Albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer I reproached you with exposing the conduct of	111.96533203125
23500/28840	de Morcerf in Epirus for guilty as I knew he was I thought you had no right to punish him but I have since learned that you had that	56.91542434692383
23501/28840	Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did Alberts	43.59165954589844
23502/28840	As for Monte Cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite	40.55976867675781
23503/28840	He could not understand how Alberts fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the Roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this	79.33604431152344
23504/28840	He recognized the influence of Mercédès and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be	63.766510009765625
23505/28840	Now sir said Albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your	101.04570770263672
23506/28840	Next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess I rank that of candidly acknowledging a	174.28114318847656
23507/28840	I acted well as a man but you have acted better than	83.72146606445312
23508/28840	An angel alone could have saved one of us from deaththat angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each	223.12400817871094
23509/28840	Monte Cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful	331.46038818359375
23510/28840	I hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience	143.09381103515625
23511/28840	But if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies I shall endeavor to correct his	115.9414291381836
23512/28840	What happened during the night asked Beauchamp of ChâteauRenaud we appear to make a very sorry figure	38.85612106323242
23513/28840	In truth what Albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the bar	103.97463989257812
23514/28840	What can it mean said Debray to	59.610260009765625
23515/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo acts dishonorably to	83.55340576171875
23516/28840	de Morcerf and is justified by his son Had I ten Yaninas in my family I should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten	140.74893188476562
23517/28840	As for Monte Cristo his head was bent down his arms were	73.20738983154297
23518/28840	Mother and Son   The Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with Maximilian and	28.0778751373291
23519/28840	Albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just	58.384727478027344
23520/28840	Indeed my dear friend said Beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhopedfor conclusion of a very disagreeable	55.2371826171875
23521/28840	Albert remained silent and wrapped in	113.49655151367188
23522/28840	ChâteauRenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible	38.15841293334961
23523/28840	Are we not going said he after this embarrassing	220.73748779296875
23524/28840	When you please replied Beauchamp allow me only to compliment	74.54100799560547
23525/28840	de Morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric	177.04197692871094
23526/28840	It is magnificent continued Beauchamp to be able to exercise so much selfcontrol   Assuredly as for me I should have been incapable of it said ChâteauRenaud with most significant cool	36.28660583496094
23527/28840	Gentlemen interrupted Albert I think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between	186.89517211914062
23528/28840	May I give you a friendly counsel Set out for Naples the Hague or	248.29342651367188

23530/28840	Seek quietude and oblivion so that you may return peaceably to France after a few	220.5910186767578
23531/28840	de ChâteauRenaud   40252m       That is quite my opinion said the gentleman nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsw	24.258867263793945
23532/28840	Thank you gentlemen replied Albert with a smile of indifference I shall follow your advicenot because you give it but because I had before intended to quit	102.57328796386719
23533/28840	I thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my	99.66544342041016
23534/28840	It is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said I remember that	69.0562515258789
23535/28840	Goodbye Albert said Beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young	48.08522033691406
23536/28840	The latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered	60.7044563293457
23537/28840	Goodbye said ChâteauRenaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his	26.313383102416992
23538/28840	Alberts lips scarcely whispered Goodbye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous	313.5705871582031
23539/28840	He preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of	77.14582061767578
23540/28840	In a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du He	15.958698272705078
23541/28840	As he alighted he thought he saw his fathers pale face behind the curtain of the counts	48.856407165527344
23542/28840	Albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own	27.88401222229004
23543/28840	He cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter	138.83831787109375
23544/28840	Then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and	120.24946594238281
23545/28840	At the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his	114.02283477783203
23546/28840	What do you want asked he with a more sorrowful than angry	74.16646575927734
23547/28840	Pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the Count of Morcerf has called	34.905147552490234
23548/28840	I did not like to go to him without first seeing	54.71086502075195
23549/28840	Why   Because the count is doubtless aware that I accompanied you to the meeting this	66.18458557128906
23550/28840	40254m       It is probable said	16.64788246154785
23551/28840	And since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened	85.98457336425781
23552/28840	What must I answer   The	84.73493194580078
23553/28840	Then I shall say the duel did not take place   You will say I apologized to the Count of Monte Crist	28.377416610717773
23554/28840	The valet bowed and retired and Albert returned to his	86.46025848388672
23555/28840	As he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his	103.3548583984375
23556/28840	He approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive	112.31305694580078
23557/28840	The door was scarcely closed when Albert bent his steps to his mothers room and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the	106.86461639404297
23558/28840	As if the same idea had animated these two beings Mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in	42.287601470947266
23559/28840	Everything was in orderlaces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the	140.65794372558594
23560/28840	Albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming My mother he threw his arms around her	100.64234924316406
23561/28840	The artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful	142.34815979003906
23562/28840	All these proofs of an energetic resolution which Albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his	126.68720245361328
23563/28840	Oh my mother exclaimed Albert so overcome he could scarcely speak it is not the same with you and meyou cannot have made the same resolution I have for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your house andand to	67.67481231689453
23564/28840	I also replied Mercédès am going and I acknowledge I had depended on your accompanying me have I deceived myself   Mother said Albert with firm	68.30254364013672
23565/28840	I cannot make you share the fate I have planned for	82.9203872680664
23566/28840	I must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a friend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned	104.50672912597656
23567/28840	So my dear mother I am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I shall require to supply my present	77.80573272705078
23568/28840	You my poor child suffer poverty and hunger Oh do not say so it will break my	173.40321350097656
23569/28840	I am young and strong I believe I am courageous and since yesterday I have learned the power of	75.26005554199219
23570/28840	No mother from this moment I have done with the past and accept nothing from itnot even a name because you can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before	97.79181671142578
23571/28840	Albert my child said Mercédès if I had a stronger heart that is the counsel I would have given you your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak listen to its	70.1031723022461
23572/28840	You had friends Albert break off their	924.1087646484375
23573/28840	But do not despair you have life before you my dear Albert for you are yet scarcely twentytwo years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my fathersit was	124.08433532714844
23574/28840	I am sure my dear Albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name	105.93685913085938
23575/28840	Then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows and if I am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for I have no future to look forward	103.81278228759766
23576/28840	For me the grave opens when I pass the threshold of this	140.10816955566406
23577/28840	I will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young	26.171926498413086
23578/28840	Yes I share your hopes the anger of Heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and I am	130.1217041015625

23581/28840	I am ready my son said Mercédè	14.151637077331543
23582/28840	He recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the Rue des SaintsPères where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the count	107.39788055419922
23583/28840	As the carriage stopped at the door and Albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a	38.105831146240234
23584/28840	Albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for Bertuccio but he was	60.38083267211914
23585/28840	He returned to Mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the	24.745410919189453

23587/28840	You are free you leave the counts house and you take your mother to your home but reflect Albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay	154.91952514648438
23588/28840	I know you are going to leave the Rue du Helder without taking anything with	30.3967227935791

23590/28840	Twentyfour years ago I returned proud and joyful to my	330.3141174316406
23591/28840	I had a betrothed Albert a lovely girl whom I adored and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless to	67.71458435058594
23592/28840	This money was for her I destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles on the Allées de Meil	70.87635040283203
23593/28840	Your mother Albert knows that poor house	759.9285888671875
23594/28840	A short time since I passed through Marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my	63.846771240234375
23595/28840	The iron box was thereno one had touched itunder a beautiful figtree my father had planted the day I was born which overshadowed the	162.04335021972656
23596/28840	Well Albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same	135.85391235351562
23597/28840	Oh feel for me who could offer millions to that poor woman but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I	167.77349853515625
23598/28840	Albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this	106.04653930664062
23599/28840	Mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards	41.1347541809082

23602/28840	Emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of	112.72285461425781
23603/28840	Morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brotherinlaws gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his count	160.7751922607422
23604/28840	At the Barrière du Trône they met Bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his	56.035972595214844

23607/28840	If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said Morrel I would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to	119.35311126708984
23608/28840	So we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten	51.43064498901367

23613/28840	The door was closed and the carriage	84.12677764892578

23615/28840	Have you not thought so   Yes said Monte Cristo for that reason I wished to keep you near	26.174470901489258
23616/28840	It is miraculous continued Morrel answering his own	194.15933227539062
23617/28840	Yes said the Count you are rightit is	47.96099090576172
23618/28840	Very brave said Monte Cristo I have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his	34.12641525268555
23619/28840	And I know he has fought two duels said Mor	92.11255645751953
23620/28840	How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning   All owing to your influence replied Monte Cristo	98.66305541992188
23621/28840	It is well for Albert he is not in the army said Mor	37.83682632446289
23622/28840	Why   An apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his	47.327369689941406
23623/28840	Doubtless doubtless said Morrel but I shall say like the Spaniard He has not been so brave today as he was	97.57606506347656

23629/28840	Now after what you told me this morning of your heart I may believe   Well count replied Morrel gayly I will not dispute	46.18124771118164
23630/28840	But you will not make me your confidant Maximilian said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the	34.078590393066406
23631/28840	I showed you this morning that I had a heart did I not count Monte Cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young	61.31266403198242
23632/28840	Well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the Bois de Vincennes it is elsewhere and I must go and find	40.15887451171875

23637/28840	Morrel disappeared down the Avenue de Marigny and Monte Cristo hastened to join Bertucc	62.17292022705078
23638/28840	She is going to leave her house said the stew	48.089290618896484
23639/28840	And her son   Florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the	40.1279411315918
23640/28840	Monte Cristo took Bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the stew	80.73320770263672
23641/28840	But first let Haydée be informed that I have	98.61921691894531
23642/28840	Here I am said the young girl who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return	50.15144729614258
23643/28840	Every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by Haydée during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly	140.49752807617188
23644/28840	Doubtless although less evident Monte Cristos joy was not less	537.7568359375
23645/28840	Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly	218.0021209716797
23646/28840	Monte Cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two Mercédès in the world and he might yet be	45.1861457824707
23647/28840	His eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of Haydée when suddenly the door	118.1248779296875
23648/28840	de Morcerf said Baptistin as if that name sufficed for his	52.4224967956543
23649/28840	Which asked he the viscount or the count   The	32.49567413330078
23650/28840	Oh exclaimed Haydée is it not yet over   I know not if it is finished my beloved child said Monte Cristo taking the young girls hands but I do know you have nothing more to	34.39356994628906
23651/28840	But it is the wretched   That man cannot injure me Haydée said Monte Cristo it was his son alone that there was cause to	45.60477066040039
23652/28840	And what I have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my	28.537397384643555
23653/28840	By my fathers tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl I swear to you Haydée that if any misfortune happens it will not be to	28.544078826904297
23654/28840	I believe you my lord as implicitly as if God had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to	42.2493782043457
23655/28840	Monte Cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other	393.3180236816406
23656/28840	Oh murmured the count shall I then be permitted to love again Ask	152.01747131347656
23657/28840	de Morcerf into the drawingroom said he to Baptistin while he led the beautiful Greek girl to a private	49.48149108886719
23658/28840	We must explain this visit which although expected by Monte Cristo is unexpected to our	148.15444946289062
23659/28840	He who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in Madame de Morcerfs	117.44915771484375
23660/28840	From that glass door the palefaced man went to the counts bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the	159.31224060058594
23661/28840	He remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own	115.63368225097656
23662/28840	For him those ten minutes were very	207.17864990234375
23663/28840	It was then Albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned	144.6263427734375
23664/28840	The counts eye expanded he knew Albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly	159.62416076660156
23665/28840	Albert returned safelythen the count was reven	236.24209594726562
23666/28840	An indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a	117.86881256103516
23667/28840	But as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his	51.952003479003906
23668/28840	Ten minutes afterwards General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black	67.17256164550781
23669/28840	He had apparently given previous orders for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coachhouse ready for	137.77146911621094
23670/28840	The valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coach	66.89112854003906
23671/28840	The coachman stooped down for his	117.5243911743164
23672/28840	To the ChampsÉlysées said the general the Count of Monte Crist	9.300559997558594
23673/28840	Hurry   The horses bounded beneath the whip and in five minutes they stopped before the counts	89.7580337524414
23674/28840	de Morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his	59.40269470214844
23675/28840	A moment afterwards Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte Cristo and the latter leading Haydée aside ordered that Morcerf be asked into the drawing	49.75399398803711
23676/28840	The general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived Monte Cristo at the	91.18843078613281
23677/28840	de Morcerf said Monte Cristo quietly I thought I had not heard ar	22.53750991821289
23678/28840	Yes it is I said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating	84.28787231445312
23679/28840	May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing	79.65794372558594
23680/28840	de Morcerf so early   Had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the	63.526206970214844
23681/28840	And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill	72.97766876220703
23682/28840	Yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even	64.64100646972656
23683/28840	Yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my	97.4745864868164
23684/28840	It is true sir said Monte Cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the	53.89571762084961
23685/28840	Doubtless you made then some apology or explanation   I explained nothing and it is he who apologized to	163.4266815185547
23686/28840	But to what do you attribute this conduct   To the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than	76.71878051757812
23687/28840	And who was that   His	47.60661697387695
23688/28840	That may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves	56.731929779052734
23689/28840	I know it and I expected this	126.05436706542969
23690/28840	You expected my son would be a coward cried the	68.9142837524414
23691/28840	Albert de Morcerf is no coward said Monte Crist	14.804681777954102
23692/28840	Albert that and he may know what to answer	75.3169937133789
23693/28840	Oh no no said the general smiling faintly I did not come for that purpose you are	68.38079071044922
23694/28840	I came to tell you that I also look upon you as my	48.12355041503906
23695/28840	I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively that it seems as if I had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do	55.97708511352539
23696/28840	Do you think so sir  	35.91826248168945
23697/28840	And when I told you I had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit I alluded	58.78495407104492
23698/28840	Are you prepared   Yes	37.487998962402344
23699/28840	You know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with	114.7424545288086
23700/28840	40262m       Until one of us dies repeated Monte Cristo moving his head slightly up and	48.215736389160156
23701/28840	Let us start then we need no	346.9349670410156
23702/28840	Very true said Monte Cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well   On the contrary said the count we know so little of each	28.531396865844727
23703/28840	Indeed said Monte Cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us	47.303836822509766
23704/28840	I know well demon that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past and that you have read by the light of what torch I know not every page of my life but perhaps I may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous cover	90.77039337158203
23705/28840	Nono I am aware you know me but I know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jew	70.16293334960938
23706/28840	You call yourself in Paris the Count of Monte Cristo in Italy Sinbad the Sailor in Malta I forget	40.5167236328125
23707/28840	But it is your real name I want to know in the midst of your hundred names that I may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when I plunge my sword through your	54.427513122558594
23708/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring	62.383880615234375
23709/28840	He leaped towards a dressingroom near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailors jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black	94.99284362792969
23710/28840	The fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness	154.0579376220703
23711/28840	He stopped at a short distance from the house and alight	22.473400115966797
23712/28840	The door was wide open a hackneycoach was standing in the middle of the yarda strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his	104.21348571777344
23713/28840	Two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid	151.685546875
23714/28840	It was Mercédès leaning on her sons arm and leaving the	23.938127517700195
23715/28840	The general drew himself up clinging to the curtain he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and	70.12252807617188
23716/28840	He soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackneycoach then the coachmans voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the	64.97149658203125
23717/28840	And at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the	75.81359100341797
23718/28840	Valentine   We may easily conceive where Morrels appointment	36.950138092041016
23719/28840	He knew his time wellthe hour when Valentine was giving Noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious	146.21041870117188
23720/28840	Noirtier and Valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that	68.75597381591797
23721/28840	Uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her	108.39335632324219
23722/28840	This uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report Morcerfs adventure had made in the world for the affair at the Opera was generally	105.20637512207031
23723/28840	No one at Villeforts doubted that a duel would ensue from	111.22944641113281
23724/28840	Valentine with her womans instinct guessed that Morrel would be Monte Cristos second and from the young mans wellknown courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to	76.32365417480469
23725/28840	We may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and Morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was	79.59693145751953
23726/28840	Now said Valentine motioning to Morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstoolnow let us talk about our own	55.77403259277344
23727/28840	You know Maximilian grandpapa once thought of leaving this house and taking an apartment away from	78.83392333984375
23728/28840	Yes said Maximilian I recollect the project of which I highly	38.24417495727539
23729/28840	Well said Valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of	103.94097137451172
23730/28840	40272m       And do you know said Valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this	53.1005744934082
23731/28840	Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him her looks her eyes her smile were all for Mor	92.81034088134766
23732/28840	Noirtiers reason answered Morrel I can readily believe it to be a good	48.05577850341797
23733/28840	He pretends the air of the Faubourg SaintHonoré is not good for	13.01801586151123
23734/28840	Noirtier may be right you have not seemed to be well for the last	54.95295333862305
23735/28840	And grandpapa has become my physician and I have the greatest confidence in him because he knows	50.20937728881836
23736/28840	Do you then really suffer asked Morrel	196.961669921875
23737/28840	Oh it must not be called suffering I feel a general uneasiness that is	52.603599548339844
23738/28840	I have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to	98.25198364257812
23739/28840	Noirtier did not lose a word of what Valentine	36.959510803222656
23740/28840	And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint   A very simple one said	119.35179901123047
23741/28840	I swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my	190.42820739746094
23742/28840	When I say one spoonful I began by onenow I take	393.1899108886719
23743/28840	Valentine smiled but it was evident that she	46.10622024536133
23744/28840	Maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at	209.19412231445312
23745/28840	She was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like motherofpearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish	131.13475036621094
23746/28840	From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirt	36.779361724853516
23747/28840	The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like Morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the	163.95205688476562
23748/28840	But said Morrel I thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for	74.99073791503906
23749/28840	Noirtier   I know it is very bitter said Valentine so bitter that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same	76.36795806884766
23750/28840	Yes grandpapa said Valentine it is	16.61858367919922
23751/28840	Just now before I came down to you I drank a glass of sugared water I left half because it seemed so	248.58555603027344
23752/28840	Noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to	18.706193923950195
23753/28840	In fact the blood was rushing to the young girls head already her cheeks were becoming	265.18499755859375
23754/28840	Oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular I cant see Did the sun shine in my eyes And she leaned against the	219.26922607421875
23755/28840	The sun is not shining said Morrel more alarmed by Noirtiers expression than by Valentines indis	162.29190063476562
23756/28840	Do not be alarmed Maximilian it is nothing and has already passed	41.78369903564453
23757/28840	But listen Do I not hear a carriage in the courtyard She opened Noirtiers door ran to a window in the passage and returned	114.61111450195312
23758/28840	Yes said she it is Madame Danglars and her daughter who have come to call on	27.07631492614746
23759/28840	GoodbyeI must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till I see you	200.5736083984375
23760/28840	Stay with grandpapa Maximilian I promise you not to persuade them to	40.13578414916992
23761/28840	40274m       Morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to Madame de Villeforts apartments and to	41.16038131713867
23762/28840	As soon as she was gone Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take the	29.060497283935547
23763/28840	Morrel obeyed guided by Valentine he had learned how to understand the old man	127.0400619506836
23764/28840	Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barroiss situation and in Noirtiers name gave that	168.60122680664062
23765/28840	The decanter and the glass were completely	134.60142517089844
23766/28840	Noirtier made a sign that he wished to	14.14871883392334
23767/28840	Why are the glass and decanter empty asked he Valentine said she only drank half the glass	235.1782684326172
23768/28840	The translation of this new question occupied another five	737.7185668945312
23769/28840	I do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle Valentines room perhaps she has emptied	33.02738571166992
23770/28840	Ask her said Morrel translating Noirtiers thought this time by his	75.73688507080078
23771/28840	The servant went out but returned almost	567.9331665039062
23772/28840	Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de Villeforts said he and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass as for the decanter Master Edward had emptied that to make a pond for his	54.80475997924805
23773/28840	Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one	85.46763610839844
23774/28840	From that moment the old mans eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit	22.077377319335938
23775/28840	It was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen they had been ushered into Madame de Villeforts room who had said she would receive them	37.556541442871094
23776/28840	That is why Valentine passed through her room which was on a level with Valentines and only separated from it by	134.3298797607422
23777/28840	The two ladies entered the drawingroom with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal	200.89207458496094
23778/28840	Madame de Villefort received them with equal solemn	80.11189270019531
23779/28840	Valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were	43.933616638183594
23780/28840	My dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands I and Eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalc	45.84488296508789
23781/28840	Danglars kept up the title of	40.35091018676758
23782/28840	The popular banker found that it answered better than	734.9430541992188
23783/28840	Allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied Madame de Ville	34.134429931640625
23784/28840	Prince Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare	37.66510009765625
23785/28840	40276m       Listen said the baroness smiling speaking to you as a friend I can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will	29.766510009765625

23790/28840	And said Madame de Villefort I need not ask you if you share that	31.738697052001953

23793/28840	Eugénie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to Valentines	83.16474914550781
23794/28840	The timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of	130.0037384033203
23795/28840	At any rate said she since I am to be married whether I will or not I ought to be thankful to Providence for having released me from my engagement with	81.4425277709961

23807/28840	Deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation Valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the	78.51044464111328
23808/28840	She would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly Madame Danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her letharg	50.18056106567383

23817/28840	That poor child said Madame de Villefort when Valentine was gone she makes me very uneasy and I should not be astonished if she had some serious	66.65154266357422
23818/28840	Meanwhile Valentine in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed Edwards room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little	119.66887664794922
23819/28840	Morrel bounded to the door opened it and found Valentine stretched out at the bottom of the	47.795597076416016

23891/28840	The former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of Gods	165.0023956298828
23892/28840	Ah indeed said Monte Cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on Maximilians	56.53314971923828
23893/28840	Yes continued Morrel death had entered that house twice within one	335.8915100097656
23894/28840	And what did the doctor answer asked Monte Crist	64.22335052490234

23896/28840	Monte Cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calm	171.09461975097656
23897/28840	Well said Maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a	66.75481414794922
23898/28840	Death is now perhaps striking a fourth	378.15411376953125
23899/28840	Count what am I bound to do being in possession of this secret   My dear friend said Monte Cristo you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by	45.057559967041016

23904/28840	There was something mournful solemn and terrible in the counts	106.80469512939453

23939/28840	Yes said the physician I repeat it she is still alive and I am astonished at	51.42439270019531
23940/28840	But is she safe asked the	254.526123046875
23941/28840	At that moment dAvrignys glance met Noirtiers	93.66131591796875
23942/28840	It glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was	102.34400939941406
23943/28840	He placed the young girl again on the chairher lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole faceand remained motionless looking at Noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he	75.16924285888672
23944/28840	Sir said dAvrigny to Villefort call Mademoiselle Valentines maid if you	16.74288558959961
23945/28840	Villefort went himself to find her and dAvrigny approached Noirt	21.183259963989258
23946/28840	Have you something to tell me asked	48.61918258666992
23947/28840	The old man winked his eyes expressively which we may remember was his only way of expressing his	234.74681091308594
23948/28840	At this moment Villefort returned followed by the ladys maid and after her came Madame de Ville	43.94599914550781
23949/28840	What is the matter then with this dear child she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but I did not think seriously of	63.281681060791016
23950/28840	The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached Valentine and took her	93.83162689208984
23951/28840	DAvrigny continued to look at Noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his	91.35525512695312
23952/28840	Ah said he involuntarily following Noirtiers eyes which were fixed on Madame de Villefort who repeated   This poor child would be better in	33.32994079589844
23953/28840	Come Fanny we will put her to	139.2222900390625
23954/28840	dAvrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with Noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he	61.29544448852539
23955/28840	They carried Valentine away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the	306.282470703125
23956/28840	She had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very	170.7843780517578
23957/28840	DAvrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemists to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughters	132.86868286132812
23958/28840	We have no time to lose I will question and do you answer	60.143341064453125
23959/28840	Noirtier made a sign that he was ready to	13.926043510437012
23960/28840	Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter  	47.9205207824707
23961/28840	DAvrigny reflected a moment then approaching Noirtier   Pardon what I am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible	68.94376373291016
23962/28840	Did you see poor Barrois die Noirtier raised his eyes to	28.865602493286133
23963/28840	Do you know of what he died asked dAvrigny placing his hand on Noirtiers	30.926279067993164
23964/28840	Do you think he died a natural death A sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of Noirt	108.27664947509766
23965/28840	Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned  	32.23101806640625
23966/28840	Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him  	106.9621353149414
23967/28840	Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has now attacked Valentine  	74.42138671875
23968/28840	Then will she die too asked dAvrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on Noirt	46.13575744628906
23969/28840	He watched the effect of this question on the old	64.04075622558594
23970/28840	No replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever div	59.40085220336914
23971/28840	Then you hope said dAvrigny with	19.762144088745117
23972/28840	What do you hope The old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not	50.20086669921875
23973/28840	Ah yes it is true murmured dAvrign	16.21360206604004
23974/28840	Then turning to NoirtierDo you hope the assassin will be tried  	49.92353820800781
23975/28840	Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine  	73.44371795654297
23976/28840	It is no news to you added dAvrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her The old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the	49.12318801879883
23977/28840	Then how do you hope Valentine will escape   Noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same	44.966552734375
23978/28840	DAvrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every	121.62120819091797
23979/28840	Ah indeed said dAvrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to youNoirtier did not let him	53.498958587646484
23980/28840	To prepare her system to resist poison  	229.07701110839844
23981/28840	By accustoming her by degrees   Yes yes yes said Noirtier delighted to be	50.904502868652344
23982/28840	I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give	36.76748275756836
23983/28840	And by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison Noirtiers joy	87.242431640625
23984/28840	Without that precaution Valentine would have died before assistance could have been proc	160.44879150390625
23985/28840	The dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate Valentine will not	103.9535140991211
23986/28840	A superhuman joy expanded the old mans eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite	63.81843185424805
23987/28840	Here doctor said he is what you sent me	76.34786224365234
23988/28840	Was this prepared in your presence   Yes replied the procure	30.805171966552734
23989/28840	Have you not let it go out of your hands  	31.889328002929688
23990/28840	DAvrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed	129.2640838623047
23991/28840	Well said he let us go to Valentine I will give instructions to everyone and you	66.84394073486328
23992/28840	de Villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from	132.579833984375
23993/28840	40294m       At the moment when dAvrigny was returning to Valentines room accompanied by Villefort an Italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of	57.930091857910156
23994/28840	No one knew how the three former tenants of that house left	243.94679260253906
23995/28840	About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o	90.3379135131836
23996/28840	The lease was drawn up for three six or nine years by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six months in	95.90986633300781
23997/28840	This new tenant who as we have said was an Italian was called Il Signor Giacomo Bus	97.69762420654297
23998/28840	Workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering	118.78375244140625
23999/28840	This formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be	130.0441131591797
24000/28840	We beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner Baron Dangl	93.70040130615234
24001/28840	In this room at about ten oclock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every	66.64044952392578
24002/28840	When his patience was exhausted he called his val	117.74916076660156
24003/28840	Étienne said he see why Mademoiselle Eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawingroom and why she makes me wait so	46.975215911865234
24004/28840	Having given this vent to his illhumor the baron became more calm Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawingroom as the	46.93984603881836
24005/28840	The singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing	81.8459701538086
24006/28840	Mademoiselles ladys maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here	111.93160247802734
24007/28840	Danglars nodded to signify that he was	40.48137283325195
24008/28840	To the world and to his servants Danglars assumed the character of the goodnatured man and the indulgent	56.29065704345703
24009/28840	Let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering	140.13140869140625
24010/28840	I will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least	132.5586700439453
24011/28840	I have chosen the drawingroom sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a bankers	92.07434844970703
24012/28840	I have therefore chosen this drawingroom where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mothers and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastor	189.646728515625
24013/28840	I rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but I should be no artist if I had not some f	91.7879638671875
24014/28840	There is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said Eugénie without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language and you appear satisfied with the	200.70468139648438
24015/28840	Now let us return to the	23.404640197753906
24016/28840	You ask me why I have requested this interview I will tell you in two words sir I will not marry count Andrea Cavalc	61.88079071044922
24017/28840	Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards	23.927759170532227
24018/28840	However this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice	113.01041412353516
24019/28840	Well sir replied Eugénie I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is	31.10711669921875
24020/28840	Well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other no	101.56645202636719
24021/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at mens faces and figures as a very good specimen of his	116.6634292602539
24022/28840	It is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirls reason which I consider quite beneath	138.70034790039062
24023/28840	I actually love no one sir you know it do you not I do not then see why without real necessity I should encumber my life with a perpetual	160.6862030029297
24024/28840	Has not some sage said Nothing too much and another I carry all my effects with me I have been taught these two aphorisms in Latin and in Greek one is I believe from Phædrus and the other from B	174.02047729492188
24025/28840	Well my dear father in the shipwreck of lifefor life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopesI cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and I remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly	136.0360107421875
24026/28840	Unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured Danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly	105.01070404052734
24027/28840	Unhappy girl replied Eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir No indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and	196.7786102294922
24028/28840	Happy on the contrary for what am I in want of The world calls me	144.99058532714844
24029/28840	It is something to be well	74.26322174072266
24030/28840	I like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so	129.19949340820312
24031/28840	I possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all I meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its	167.98211669921875
24032/28840	I am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in	37.0898551940918

24034/28840	Besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur	95.65656280517578
24035/28840	Under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute	166.1863250732422
24036/28840	Truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing I will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess	118.4730453491211
24037/28840	Eugénie looked at Danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be	89.4833755493164
24038/28840	My daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall	133.7279815673828
24039/28840	Eugénie bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a	86.417724609375
24040/28840	My daughter continued Danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to	118.37393951416016
24041/28840	Some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their	127.1923828125
24042/28840	This is not my weakness I tell you at once family joys have no charm for	102.78641510009766
24043/28840	I may acknowledge this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a	126.28858947753906
24044/28840	This is not to the purpose said Eugénie let us speak candidly sir I admire cand	36.25257873535156
24045/28840	Oh said Danglars I can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general	152.48899841308594
24046/28840	40302m       It is just as I tell you I assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this	25.60173988342285
24047/28840	I do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or antipoetic impressions and	150.62615966796875
24048/28840	But in that same bankers study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you monthly for pocketmoney you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not	85.76525115966797
24049/28840	There one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility I will inform you of in the drawingroom namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and	171.3250732421875
24050/28840	de Monte Cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which I have never	55.33633041381836
24051/28840	There we may learn that as credit sinks the body becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his	117.12640380859375
24052/28840	But Eugénie instead of stooping drew herself up under the	112.83955383300781
24053/28840	Exactly my daughter that is precisely what I mean said Danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man ruinedyes that is	99.2042007446289
24054/28840	Yes ruined Now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet	300.70465087890625
24055/28840	Now my daughter learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect	101.75613403320312
24056/28840	Oh cried Eugénie you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine I deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn	60.43202209472656
24057/28840	Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars Undeceive yourself again either I am greatly mistaken or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you and which will pass over without affecting	132.13389587402344
24058/28840	She has taken care for herselfat least I hope sofor her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over	149.10853576660156
24059/28840	She has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for	407.8554992675781

24067/28840	You think I shall deprive you of those three millions said Danglars but do not fear	34.55550003051758
24068/28840	They are destined to produce at least	122.9204330444336
24069/28840	I and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that Law once held out to the eternally deluded Parisians in the fantastic Mississippi	186.43634033203125
24070/28840	As I look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the	84.74932098388672
24071/28840	We make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our	147.66891479492188

24073/28840	That deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if I had employed it for another purpose I should bring on me a disgraceful	172.03074645996094

24082/28840	Very well   What next what more do you want   I wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person  	63.86796188354492
24083/28840	Then as I said before sirvery well I am ready to marry	102.73722076416016
24084/28840	But what are you up to   Ah that is my	37.8631706237793
24085/28840	What advantage should I have over you if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine   Danglars bit his	57.76850128173828
24086/28840	Then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable   Yes replied Eugé	40.21489715576172
24087/28840	And to sign the contract in three days  	35.23306655883789
24088/28840	Then in my turn I also say very well   Danglars pressed his daughters hand in	25.881567001342773
24089/28840	But extraordinary to relate the father did not say Thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her	197.1310577392578
24090/28840	Is the conference ended asked Eugénie	180.0850067138672
24091/28840	Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to	19.246822357177734
24092/28840	Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle dArmillys fingers and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantios malediction on Desdem	62.41938018798828
24093/28840	At the end of the piece Étienne entered and announced to Eugénie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her	32.790733337402344
24094/28840	We have seen them at Villeforts they proceeded then on their	94.22044372558594
24095/28840	Andrea Cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a	84.14186096191406
24096/28840	He inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the	53.114349365234375
24097/28840	The count stopped on seeing the young	79.06431579589844
24098/28840	As for Andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped	177.53982543945312
24099/28840	Ah good morning my dear count said	51.614498138427734
24100/28840	Andrea said the latter with his halfjesting tone how do you do   Charmingly as you	115.42687225341797
24101/28840	I am come to talk to you about a thousand things but first tell me were you going out or just returned   I was going out	70.18457794189453
24102/28840	Then in order not to hinder you I will get up with you if you please in your carriage and Tom shall follow with my phaeton in	77.08114624023438
24103/28840	No said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young mans societyno I prefer listening to you here my dear	31.968454360961914
24104/28840	Andrea we can chat better indoors and there is no coachman to overhear our	186.6218719482422
24105/28840	The count returned to a small drawingroom on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat	45.88500213623047
24106/28840	You know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this	40.45795440673828
24107/28840	At nine oclock the contract is to be signed at my fatherin	42.082435607910156
24108/28840	What is it news to you Has not	184.760498046875
24109/28840	Danglars informed you of the ceremony   Oh yes said the count I received a letter from him yesterday but I do not think the hour was	30.203052520751953
24110/28840	Possibly my fatherinlaw trusted to its general	402.47003173828125
24111/28840	Well said Monte Cristo you are fortunate	31.894948959350586
24112/28840	Cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome	37.6877326965332
24113/28840	Yes indeed she is replied Cavalcanti in a very modest	97.9629135131836
24114/28840	Above all she is very richat least I believe so said Monte Crist	54.91504669189453
24115/28840	Very rich do you think replied the young	49.651512145996094
24116/28840	Danglars conceals at least half of his	65.34627532958984
24117/28840	And he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said Andrea with a look sparkling with	117.47610473632812
24118/28840	Without reckoning added Monte Cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United States and in England but quite novel in	78.0730209350586
24119/28840	Yes yes I know what you meanthe railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not   Precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that	75.57400512695312
24120/28840	Ten millions Do you think so It is magnificent said Cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden	75.71363067626953
24121/28840	Without reckoning replied Monte Cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only	36.362674713134766
24122/28840	Besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrot	67.13826751708984
24123/28840	Andrea I think you have managed this affair rather skilfully   Not badly by any means said the young man I was born for a diplomat	62.2093620300293
24124/28840	Well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is instinct	86.51023864746094
24125/28840	Have you lost your heart   Indeed I fear it replied Andrea in the tone in which he had heard Dorante or Valère reply to Alceste21 at the Théâtre Franç	106.2246322631836
24126/28840	Is your love returned   I suppose so said Andrea with a triumphant smile since I am	66.34709930419922
24127/28840	But I must not forget one grand	407.74578857421875
24128/28840	Which   That I have been singularly	63.9218635559082
24129/28840	By circumstances   No by	99.3470230102539
24130/28840	By me Not at all prince said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress on the title what have I done for you Are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient   No said Andreano it is useless for you to say so	80.61949920654297
24131/28840	I maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my	106.69581604003906
24132/28840	What encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize youyour fathers name so well known in Italy and so highly	189.78567504882812
24133/28840	This calm tone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken	149.069580078125
24134/28840	Oh then my father has really a very large fortune count   It appears so sir replied Monte Crist	44.27886962890625
24135/28840	Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come   I have been advised of	66.53278350830078
24136/28840	But the three millions   The three millions are probably on the	35.5303955078125
24137/28840	Then I shall really have them   Oh well said the count I do not think you have yet known the want of	34.68667221069336
24138/28840	Andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a	100.42744445800781
24139/28840	Then arousing from his reverie   Now sir I have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to	48.634822845458984
24140/28840	I have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of	105.81124877929688
24141/28840	I understand well I am come to ask a favor of	70.84907531738281
24142/28840	Of me   Yes of	53.76860046386719
24143/28840	And pray what may it be   Well to take his	63.329524993896484
24144/28840	I who have a seraglio at Cairo one at Smyrna and one at Constantinople preside at a weddingnever   Then you refuse me   Decidedly and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the same	64.07234191894531
24145/28840	But what must be done said Andrea	85.66450500488281
24146/28840	You said just now that you had a hundred	101.67857360839844
24147/28840	Very true but you introduced me at	188.07911682128906
24148/28840	Not at all Let us recall the exact	175.44004821777344
24149/28840	You met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house that is a totally different	107.65762329101562
24150/28840	Yes but by my marriage you have forwarded	99.08407592773438
24151/28840	Inot in the least I beg you to	57.77268600463867
24152/28840	Recollect what I told you when you asked me to propose	47.624393463134766
24153/28840	Oh I never make matches my dear prince it is my settled	140.80470275878906
24154/28840	50025m       But at least you will be there   Will all Paris be there   Oh	30.143035888671875
24155/28840	Well like all Paris I shall be there too said the	49.88809585571289
24156/28840	And will you sign the contract   I see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus	71.7934799194336
24157/28840	Well since you will grant me no more I must be content with what you give	56.57929229736328
24158/28840	Be careful advice is worse than a	391.9953918457031
24159/28840	Oh you can give me this without compromising	71.26287841796875
24160/28840	Is my wifes fortune five hundred thousand livres   That is the sum	40.57118225097656
24161/28840	Because said Andrea with a certain illconcealed uneasiness I thought I heard my fatherinlaw say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just	57.53736114501953
24162/28840	Well replied Monte Cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve	76.95316314697266
24163/28840	Baron Danglars is a good father and knows how to	72.24896240234375
24164/28840	In that case said Andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves	91.08869171142578
24165/28840	You must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar	357.8241271972656
24166/28840	Well said Andrea let it be as you	63.00716781616211
24167/28840	Notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of Monte Cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile Andrea seized the counts hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and	108.94265747070312
24168/28840	An Academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing	217.72329711914062
24169/28840	Mademoiselle Eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single	96.39894104003906
24170/28840	Her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest	498.5960388183594
24171/28840	Madame Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray Beauchamp and ChâteauRen	10.166751861572266
24172/28840	Debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular	102.11343383789062
24173/28840	Danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the	97.33074951171875
24174/28840	The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and	170.45162963867188
24175/28840	As usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most	355.2771301269531
24176/28840	If there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a birdofparad	162.6321258544922
24177/28840	At each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the doorkeepers voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different	107.91378021240234
24178/28840	The count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his	107.93910217285156
24179/28840	His only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waist	93.81078338623047
24180/28840	A circle was immediately formed around the	545.6400756835938
24181/28840	The count perceived at one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawingroom	44.43658447265625
24182/28840	Danglars at the other and Eugénie in front of	17.601503372192383
24183/28840	Near her was Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for Italy which she intended immediately to make use	43.71398162841797
24184/28840	On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars who had advanced to meet	32.30485916137695
24185/28840	Having accomplished these three social duties Monte Cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say I have done my duty now let others do	117.66856384277344
24186/28840	Andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of Monte Cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the	49.38883972167969
24187/28840	He found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weight	213.42776489257812
24188/28840	The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions	146.39865112304688
24189/28840	One of the notaries sat down the other remained	95.62171936035156
24190/28840	They were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half Paris assembled was to	103.39163208007812
24191/28840	All took their places or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what Boileau calls the _style énergique_ commented on the feverish agitation of Andrea on	154.1125946044922
24192/28840	Danglars riveted attention Eugénies composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important	55.05134963989258
24193/28840	The contract was read during a profound	417.6617126464844
24194/28840	Mademoiselle Danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in spl	34.869483947753906
24195/28840	As for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without	126.85870361328125
24196/28840	Andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewild	113.34587860107422
24197/28840	The notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said   Gentlemen we are about to sign the	78.56324768066406
24198/28840	The baron was to sign first then the representative of	126.52619171142578
24199/28840	Cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal	158.70794677734375
24200/28840	The baron took the pen and signed then the	139.50611877441406
24201/28840	The baroness approached leaning on Madame de Villeforts	47.49695587158203
24202/28840	My dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious An unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of Monte Cristos in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing	102.31078338623047
24203/28840	Danglars in the same tone in which he would have said Oh well what do I care   As a matter of fact said Monte Cristo approaching I am much afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his	35.96077346801758
24204/28840	What you count said Madame Danglars signing if you are take care for I shall never forgive	25.97382164001465
24205/28840	But it is not my fault as I shall endeavor to	26.61507797241211
24206/28840	Everyone listened eagerly Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to	82.7350845336914
24207/28840	You remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave	64.09036254882812
24208/28840	In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they	73.51680755615234
24209/28840	Andrea turned pale and drew towards the door he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming	180.60752868652344
24210/28840	Well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the	174.50767517089844
24211/28840	The ladies screamed and two or three prepared to	221.21533203125
24212/28840	No one could guess what the dirty rag could be I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered	147.56552124023438
24213/28840	My valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out it was a letter addressed to you bar	67.76881408691406
24214/28840	Yes indeed to you I succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied Monte Cristo amid the general outburst of amaz	77.03661346435547
24215/28840	But asked Madame Danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent	32.88517379760742
24216/28840	de Villefort   In this simple way madame replied Monte Cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence I therefore sent them to the kings	44.892799377441406
24217/28840	You understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases it was perhaps some plot against	163.5979766845703
24218/28840	Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo and disappeared in the second drawing	113.30793762207031
24219/28840	Possibly said Danglars was not this murdered man an old galleyslave   50025m       Yes replied the count a felon named Cader	21.68949317932129
24220/28840	Danglars turned slightly pale Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing	70.6919174194336
24221/28840	But go on signing said Monte Cristo I perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and I beg to apologize to you baroness and to Mademoiselle Dangl	24.158605575561523
24222/28840	The baroness who had signed returned the pen to the not	60.88703155517578
24223/28840	Prince Cavalcanti said the latter Prince Cavalcanti where are you   Andrea Andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian	55.5428466796875
24224/28840	Call the prince inform him that it is his turn to sign cried Danglars to one of the floor	39.29566192626953
24225/28840	But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments _quærens quem devoret	231.8942413330078
24226/28840	There was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to	160.37290954589844

24274/28840	You are a perfect Amazon Eugénie And the two young girls began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should	78.6083984375
24275/28840	There now said Eugénie while I change my costume do you lock the portmante	70.77719116210938
24276/28840	Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmante	41.88394546508789
24277/28840	But I cannot said she I am not strong enough do you shut	106.20649719238281
24278/28840	When this was done Eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling	140.1194610595703
24279/28840	Here said she you see I have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be	69.78219604492188

24283/28840	From the same drawer she took a mans complete costume from the boots to the coat and a provision of linen where there was nothing superfluous but every	150.72459411621094
24284/28840	Then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony	110.22447967529297
24285/28840	50039m       Oh the magnificent hair said Louise with	76.00274658203125
24286/28840	And am I not a hundred times better thus cried Eugénie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so   Oh you are beautifulalways beautiful cried	108.2492904663086

24291/28840	And they would be right _pardieu_   Oh I think you swore Eugé	33.1142692565918
24292/28840	And the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their	154.50616455078125
24293/28840	The yard was empty the clock was striking	716.1609497070312
24294/28840	The porter was not yet gone to	102.18523406982422
24295/28840	Eugénie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his	75.67327880859375
24296/28840	She returned to Louise took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the	34.377838134765625
24297/28840	Eugénie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one	88.07514953613281
24298/28840	Then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard   Gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the	128.9581756591797
24299/28840	The porter got up as Eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his ridingwhip he opened it	108.38533782958984
24300/28840	Louise slid through the halfopen gate like a snake and bounded lightly	387.7757873535156
24301/28840	Eugénie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her	116.5075454711914
24302/28840	A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau then the two young girls having told him to take it to	42.947044372558594
24303/28840	36 Rue de la Victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted	255.0814971923828
24304/28840	As for Eugénie she was as strong as a Judith or a Delil	161.35072326660156
24305/28840	Eugénie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him	58.95877456665039
24306/28840	The shutter where Eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to	115.05628204345703
24307/28840	Mademoiselle said Eugénie let the porter get the postchaise from the coachhouse and fetch some posthorses from the	30.04242515563965
24308/28840	Here are five francs for his	143.97982788085938
24309/28840	Indeed said Louise I admire you and I could almost say respect	230.36231994628906
24310/28840	The laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no	157.8449249267578
24311/28840	In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a postboy and horses which were harnessed and put in the postchaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and	41.46601104736328
24312/28840	Here is the passport said the postilion which way are we going young gentleman   To Fontainebleau replied Eugénie with an almost masculine	64.30786895751953
24313/28840	I am giving them the slip said Eugénie this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty we will soon alter our	104.74115753173828
24314/28840	And the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the	103.6803970336914
24315/28840	You are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her	66.97433471679688
24316/28840	A quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the Barrière Saint	50.79884338378906
24317/28840	Ah said Louise breathing freely here we are out of	148.71437072753906
24318/28840	Yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied Eugé	79.88575744628906
24319/28840	I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied Eugé	224.1956329345703
24320/28840	These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of La Vil	114.86491394042969
24321/28840	The Bell and Bottle Tavern   And now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing their way to Brussels and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to	60.5755500793457
24322/28840	Notwithstanding his youth Master Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent	284.72357177734375
24323/28840	We have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last	64.30223083496094
24324/28840	But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the _trousseau_ of the brideelect was on	84.011962890625
24325/28840	There were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls Valenciennes lace English veils and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called the _corbeille	190.1553497314453
24326/28840	22 Now in passing through this room Andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent but also provident for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before	107.3967514038086
24327/28840	Furnished with this plunder Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarm	80.33268737792969
24328/28840	Having passed through the Rue du MontBlanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the Rue La F	66.20372009277344
24329/28840	He was quite alone on one side was the vast wilderness of the SaintLazare on the other Paris enshrouded in	111.76972198486328
24330/28840	Am I to be captured he cried no not if I can use more activity than my	255.03623962402344
24331/28840	My safety is now a mere question of	210.27203369140625
24332/28840	At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonni	25.96333885192871
24333/28840	The dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the Faubourg SaintDenis where no doubt he ordinarily had his	118.50394439697266
24334/28840	What do you want sir asked the	51.343719482421875
24335/28840	Is your horse tired   Tired oh yes tired enoughhe has done nothing the whole of this blessed day Four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that I have earned and I ought to take ten to the	174.56617736816406
24336/28840	Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have   With pleasure sir twenty francs are not to be	87.54435729980469
24337/28840	Tell me what I am to do for	46.13909912109375
24338/28840	A very easy thing if your horse isnt	324.67340087890625
24339/28840	I tell you hell go like the windonly tell me which way to	216.70266723632812
24340/28840	Ah I know the wayyou get good sweetened rum over	719.9166259765625
24341/28840	Exactly so I merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom I am going to hunt tomorrow at ChapelleenServ	54.30781936645508
24342/28840	He should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till halfpast eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone	79.80797576904297
24343/28840	Well will you try and overtake him   Nothing I should like	91.87461853027344
24344/28840	If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have twenty francs if not before Louvres	115.6646728515625
24345/28840	And if we do overtake him   Forty said Andrea after a moments hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely	44.323062896728516
24346/28840	Everyone had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance at length they reached it but it was not the	78.05362701416016
24347/28840	Once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two posth	149.4173583984375
24348/28840	Ah said Cavalcanti to himself if I only had that britzka those two good posthorses and above all the passport that carries them on And he sighed	97.72427368164062
24349/28840	The calash contained Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle dArm	8.434847831726074
24350/28840	Hurry hurry said Andrea we must overtake him	967.1701049804688
24351/28840	And the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at Louv	191.3687744140625
24352/28840	Certainly said Andrea I shall not overtake my friend but I shall kill your horse therefore I had better	78.0374755859375
24353/28840	Here are thirty francs I will sleep at the _Cheval Rouge_ and will secure a place in the first	49.32497787475586
24354/28840	And Andrea after placing six pieces of five francs each in the mans hand leaped lightly on to the	102.23075103759766
24355/28840	The cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to	178.19313049316406
24356/28840	Then he rested he must be near ChapelleenServal where he pretended to be	83.8941879272461
24357/28840	It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some	173.7599639892578
24358/28840	It would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage posthorses to travel either way a passport was	134.44952392578125
24359/28840	It was still more impossible to remain in the department of the Oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in France this was quite out of the question especially to a man like Andrea perfectly conversant with criminal	115.97090148925781
24360/28840	He sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and	24.95012092590332
24361/28840	Ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was	99.80744934082031
24362/28840	He threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to ChapelleenServal he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the	73.70465850830078
24363/28840	My friend said Andrea I was coming from Mortefontaine to Senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw	140.7554931640625
24364/28840	I must reach Compiègne tonight or I shall cause deep anxiety to my	107.40361022949219
24365/28840	Could you let me hire a horse of you   An innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or	81.1006851196289
24366/28840	The host called the stableboy and ordered him to saddle _Le Blanc_ then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the	133.9912109375
24367/28840	Andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting	195.64053344726562
24368/28840	There is an excellent tavern at Compiègne well remembered by those who have ever been	49.55154800415039
24369/28840	My friend said Andrea I have been dining at SaintJeanauxBois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool I have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the	96.61389923095703
24370/28840	Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Borde	67.80960845947266
24371/28840	While the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose Andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have	158.32540893554688
24372/28840	3 which he had occupied on his last stay at Compièg	36.64916229248047
24373/28840	3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his	50.86907958984375
24374/28840	Andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that	273.0885314941406
24375/28840	7 prepared for him was situated precisely the same as	180.1986541748047
24376/28840	3 and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at Chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be	102.87247467041016
24377/28840	The fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had	194.54440307617188
24378/28840	Then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with	78.00767517089844
24379/28840	Now here we are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did	76.05060577392578
24380/28840	This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his	76.19943237304688
24381/28840	Moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misad	54.53776931762695
24382/28840	These were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused Andrea to sleep so sound	313.83819580078125
24383/28840	In order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and longpointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from	114.03148651123047
24384/28840	About seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his	95.36490631103516
24385/28840	In all wellorganized brains the predominating ideaand there always is oneis sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the	270.23883056640625
24386/28840	Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too	116.7825927734375
24387/28840	He jumped out of bed and ran to the	85.38531494140625
24388/28840	A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very	91.48445129394531
24389/28840	Why is that gendarme there asked Andrea of	134.69561767578125
24390/28840	Then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress	146.00247192382812
24391/28840	And the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in	71.62702178955078
24392/28840	Now then said Andrea while dressing himself Ill wait till he leaves and then Ill slip	369.37725830078125
24393/28840	50047m       And saying this Andrea who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin	61.26312255859375
24394/28840	The appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the	90.91455841064453
24395/28840	Theyre after me was Andreas first	466.8255310058594
24396/28840	_Diable_   A pallor overspread the young mans forehead and he looked around him with	31.98720932006836
24397/28840	His room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of	98.91874694824219
24398/28840	I am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in Andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and deathdeath without mercy or	300.4842224121094
24399/28840	He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimneypiece they were a pen ink and	51.4555778503418
24400/28840	With forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper   I have no money to pay my bill but I am not a dishonest man I leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the	97.97160339355469
24401/28840	I shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for I was	84.83236694335938
24402/28840	He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the	42.15239715576172
24403/28840	At this precise time the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the	62.31992721557617
24404/28840	Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following	431.1622314453125
24405/28840	At daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of Cader	96.90373229980469
24406/28840	Now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hôtel de Ville which is next door to the Bell and Bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the	63.76486587524414
24407/28840	The sentinel who was relieved at six oclock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before	49.67375946044922
24408/28840	The young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his	71.6720199584961
24409/28840	This late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than Andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his	92.5404281616211
24410/28840	Oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open I would rather find it triply	167.638671875
24411/28840	And indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad	238.8226776123047
24412/28840	We say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single	169.3411865234375
24413/28840	He glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chim	133.92031860351562
24414/28840	Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious	114.59701538085938
24415/28840	The brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to	144.31924438476562
24416/28840	The fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they	242.52786254882812
24417/28840	If once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another	126.96775817871094
24418/28840	He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by	94.63296508789062
24419/28840	At the same minute one of the little windows of the Hôtel de Ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme	23.218263626098633
24420/28840	For an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head	70.55119323730469
24421/28840	The brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and reentered the	95.58279418945312
24422/28840	Well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the VillersCoterets and Noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no	121.21685791015625
24423/28840	The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the	210.40481567382812
24424/28840	Ah what is that cried the brig	50.7935905456543

24436/28840	The brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting Andrea had excited in the	83.72510528564453
24437/28840	This is what had happened Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend twothirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he	110.88581085205078
24438/28840	It would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was	129.0999755859375
24439/28840	Two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a	176.48684692382812
24440/28840	One of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bellrope rang with all her	96.95771789550781
24441/28840	Andrea as we can see was surrounded by	351.8786926269531

24451/28840	Andrea shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious	72.72002410888672

24456/28840	The two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galleysl	68.13044738769531
24457/28840	Andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked Have you any message for your father Mademoiselle Danglars for in all probability I shall return to Paris   Eugénie covered her face with her	30.673065185546875
24458/28840	Oh oh said Andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post after	202.13169860839844
24459/28840	Was I not nearly your husband   50056m       And with this raillery Andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the	32.06727981567383
24460/28840	An hour after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine	297.0733947753906
24461/28840	The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering	128.12823486328125
24462/28840	Eugénie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the	64.77850341796875
24463/28840	The next day they stopped at the Hôtel de Flandre at	52.626678466796875
24464/28840	The same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Concierger	666.5112915039062

24466/28840	We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser Lucien Debr	67.7167739868164
24467/28840	Tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one oclock in the	85.1475830078125

24470/28840	The baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugénie used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of Eugé	92.82078552246094
24471/28840	She was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal	210.8693389892578
24472/28840	She listened at Eugénies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in	121.2748031616211
24473/28840	Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to	34.06167984008789
24474/28840	She called the maid and questioned	279.7201232910156
24475/28840	Mademoiselle Eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with Mademoiselle dArmilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no	38.22760772705078
24476/28840	Since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room Madame Danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent	93.37413787841797
24477/28840	In proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a	199.3257598876953
24478/28840	And then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and	43.8557243347168
24479/28840	Eugénie she said to herself is lost and so are	132.16079711914062
24480/28840	The affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable	204.5443878173828
24481/28840	How fortunate that Eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble   And her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious Providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a	124.962890625
24482/28840	And then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on Cavalc	211.2994384765625
24483/28840	This Andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable	90.7698745727539

24485/28840	And since Villefort the friend of Danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of Andreas intrig	58.20354461669922
24486/28840	Villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual	129.50393676757812
24487/28840	But the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could	79.17546081542969
24488/28840	She would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy	319.2206115722656

24490/28840	And after this reasoning she slept	427.345947265625

24509/28840	Without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew	39.13180160522461
24510/28840	The valet de chambre appeared on the door	19.499584197998047

24514/28840	The baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrates	47.82769012451172
24515/28840	Preoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of	72.09870910644531
24516/28840	But Villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her	72.4133071899414

24518/28840	Madame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so	55.89045715332031

24526/28840	Am I come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful	94.30854034423828
24527/28840	You know that you are madame said Villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the	44.95197677612305
24528/28840	And truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and	150.87603759765625
24529/28840	Well then be more affectionate my dear Villefort said the baron	21.37084197998047

24531/28840	When I hear misfortunes named madame he said I have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then I cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my	61.05105972290039

24544/28840	Yes I know what you mean he said you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from which Valentine has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural	93.31938934326172
24545/28840	I was not thinking of that replied Madame Danglars	18.794618606567383
24546/28840	Yes you were thinking of it and with	102.49423217773438

24559/28840	Alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness   Villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his	125.16307830810547

24570/28840	I tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute   Sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the Minister of the	37.08951950073242
24571/28840	Villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the	105.4598159790039
24572/28840	Madame Danglars trembled with fear Villefort started with	32.13774108886719
24573/28840	Arrested he exclaimed he was taken at Compiègne and all is	62.375850677490234
24574/28840	Madame Danglars rose from her seat pale and	39.94898223876953
24575/28840	Adieu madame replied the kings attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the	68.54666137695312
24576/28840	Then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand   Come I had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson I only wanted a murder and here it	81.40618896484375
24577/28840	The Apparition   As the procureur had told Madame Danglars Valentine was not yet	67.30020141601562
24578/28840	But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of	87.20895385742188
24579/28840	Indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her	208.88084411621094
24580/28840	During the daytime Valentines perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of	164.64634704589844
24581/28840	Noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughters room and watched her with his paternal tenderness Villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and	99.60938262939453
24582/28840	At six oclock Villefort retired to his study at eight	54.14567184448242
24583/28840	dAvrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then	84.00211334228516
24584/28840	A nurse of the doctors choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven oclock when Valentine was	201.48435974121094
24585/28840	As she went downstairs she gave the keys of Valentines room to	96.883544921875
24586/28840	de Villefort so that no one could reach the sickroom excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little	37.882057189941406
24587/28840	Every morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less	200.14358520507812
24588/28840	Certainly though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover Monte Cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the counts house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be	115.55496978759766
24589/28840	Now four days had elapsed and Valentine still	294.7264099121094
24590/28840	Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully	78.26602935791016
24591/28840	At any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bellpull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present	208.16851806640625
24592/28840	Her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of	104.7686767578125
24593/28840	From behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize Mor	124.01838684082031
24594/28840	The figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound	149.20069885253906
24595/28840	At this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight	119.08546447753906
24596/28840	It is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other	104.76009368896484
24597/28840	Valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his	73.23846435546875
24598/28840	This time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything Valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her	306.20245361328125
24599/28840	The pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew	252.7926025390625
24600/28840	Then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the nightlight held it up as if to test its	108.75450897216797
24601/28840	This did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghostfor he trod so softly that no sound was heardthen poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank	111.6053237915039
24602/28840	Valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupef	35.71302795410156
24603/28840	Every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice Now you may	127.72813415527344
24604/28840	It was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an ex	41.03432083129883
24605/28840	The man placed his finger on her	59.8384895324707

24607/28840	It was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girls mind as to the reality of the scene her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to	71.45250701904297
24608/28840	Still the presence of Monte Cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered	76.04955291748047
24609/28840	Listen to me he said or rather look upon me look at my face paler even than usual and my eyes red with wearinessfor four days I have not closed them for I have been constantly watching you to protect and preserve you for Maximil	132.98995971679688
24610/28840	The blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of Valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired	156.6807403564453
24611/28840	Maximilian she exclaimed and so sweet did the sound appear to her that she repeated itMaximilianhas he then owned all to you  	109.79752349853516
24612/28840	He told me your life was his and I have promised him that you shall	59.72807693481445
24613/28840	You have promised him that I shall live  	31.22509002685547
24614/28840	But sir you spoke of vigilance and	271.57025146484375
24615/28840	Are you a doctor   Yes the best you could have at the present time believe	50.45539474487305
24616/28840	But you say you have watched said Valentine uneasily where have you beenI have not seen	65.74322509765625
24617/28840	The count extended his hand towards the	99.23467254638672
24618/28840	I was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which I have	89.97005462646484
24619/28840	Valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed   Sir I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an	84.35401153564453
24620/28840	But drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the	55.43232727050781
24621/28840	Drink this and then take nothing more	457.3697509765625
24622/28840	Valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in	66.6524887084961
24623/28840	Monte Cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to Valentine who smiled and swallowed the	186.79432678222656
24624/28840	Oh yes she exclaimed I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching	173.93553161621094
24625/28840	Thank you sir thank you   This is how you have lived during the last four nights Valentine said the	50.199607849121094
24626/28840	Valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of	116.40192413330078
24627/28840	You saw the person repeated the young	91.557861328125
24628/28840	What you tell me is horrible	129.34121704101562

24631/28840	Your grandfather knows then that a poisoner lives here perhaps he even suspects the	334.0522766113281
24632/28840	He has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with	118.2051773071289
24633/28840	But even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too	206.830810546875
24634/28840	But who then is this assassin this murderer   Let me also ask you a	114.20288848876953
24635/28840	Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life   50073m       No said Valentine who could desire my death   You shall know it now then said Monte Cristo	26.30215835571289
24636/28840	How do you mean said Valentine looking anxiously	55.01390838623047
24637/28840	Because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers	280.7262878417969
24638/28840	Oh heavens exclaimed Valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her	558.1886596679688
24639/28840	Midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor	264.9942321777344
24640/28840	Valentine said the count summon up all your courage still the beatings of your heart do not let a sound escape you and feign to be asleep then you will	86.80875396728516
24641/28840	I think I hear a noise she said leave	117.85038757324219
24642/28840	Goodbye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girls heart was filled with	84.39170837402344
24643/28840	Before closing the door he turned around once more and said Not a movementnot a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before I have the power of helping	101.76336669921875
24644/28840	And with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after	60.26192855834961
24645/28840	Locusta   Valentine was alone two other clocks slower than that of SaintPhilippeduRoule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was	101.4155044555664
24646/28840	Then Valentines attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the	69.0705795288086
24647/28840	She began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubtedthe inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her	175.9354705810547
24648/28840	Why should they To what end What had she done to excite the malice of an enemy   There was no fear of her falling	117.61785125732422
24649/28840	One terrible idea pressed upon her mindthat someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so	81.05603790283203
24650/28840	But through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countthat eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted	145.08311462402344
24651/28840	Twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half	374.8522033691406
24652/28840	Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the	76.96324920654297
24653/28840	Someone approached the bed and drew back the	62.51708221435547
24654/28840	Valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil	225.89767456054688
24655/28840	The girl shuddered to the heart but did not	47.41633605957031
24656/28840	Still silent Valentine had promised not to	476.7649841308594
24657/28840	Then everything was still excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just	104.78157043457031
24658/28840	Then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended	113.58815002441406
24659/28840	She saw a woman in a white dressinggown pouring a liquor from a phial into her	87.31051635742188
24660/28840	During this short time Valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept it was Madame de Ville	116.09483337402344
24661/28840	On recognizing her stepmother Valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the	93.15679931640625
24662/28840	Madame de Villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bedcurtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of	70.13529968261719
24663/28840	The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp	81.05541229248047
24664/28840	Then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the	218.68687438964844
24665/28840	Madame de Villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of Valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the	72.9203109741211
24666/28840	Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had left the	79.29705047607422
24667/28840	She only witnessed the withdrawal of the armthe fair round arm of a woman but twentyfive years old and who yet spread death around	134.37889099121094
24668/28840	50077m       It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the	31.103057861328125
24669/28840	The grating against the librarydoor aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insens	88.43855285644531

24676/28840	He took the glass and raised it to his	33.809471130371094

24684/28840	My father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked Valentine clasping her	78.03267669677734
24685/28840	No and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over youhe should have occupied my placehe should have emptied that glasshe should have risen against the	100.69256591796875
24686/28840	Spectre against spectre he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his	124.83441925048828
24687/28840	Sir said Valentine I will do all I can to live for there are two beings who love me and will die if I diemy grandfather and Maximil	62.0579948425293
24688/28840	I will watch over them as I have over	48.10760498046875
24689/28840	Valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a	67.46265411376953
24690/28840	Then he drew from his waistcoatpocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her	86.65428161621094
24691/28840	She took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her vener	60.166717529296875
24692/28840	She evidently interrogated him by her	343.4648132324219
24693/28840	Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed	118.0793685913086
24694/28840	And now my dear child adieu for the	67.95034790039062

24696/28840	Go said Valentine whatever happens I promise you not to	125.66397857666016
24697/28840	Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given	66.10945892333984
24698/28840	Valentine   The nightlight continued to burn on the chimneypiece exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the	50.91686248779297
24699/28840	The globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final ag	128.26235961914062
24700/28840	A dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young	144.99839782714844
24701/28840	All noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was fright	65.32393646240234
24702/28840	It was then that the door of Edwards room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was Madame de Villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had	70.35234832763672
24703/28840	She stopped in the doorway listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp the only sound in that deserted room and then advanced to the table to see if Valentines glass were	106.13713836669922
24704/28840	It was still about a quarter full as we before	181.7802276611328
24705/28840	Madame de Villefort emptied the contents into the ashes which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the	95.96503448486328
24706/28840	If anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on	56.47412109375
24707/28840	The dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own	121.87816619873047
24708/28840	At length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on	179.91111755371094
24709/28840	The young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the halfclosed teeth the white lips no longer quiveredthe eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as	178.0349884033203
24710/28840	Madame de Villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girls	84.06730651855469
24711/28840	She only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a	129.19129943847656
24712/28840	Madame de Villefort had no longer any doubt all was overshe had consummated the last terrible work she had to	109.63858795166016
24713/28840	The minutes passed Madame de Villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of	81.07701873779297
24714/28840	She was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is	102.17500305175781
24715/28840	Just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled Madame de Villefort who shuddered and dropped the	56.368896484375
24716/28840	Immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck halfpast	230.5191192626953
24717/28840	Overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of	152.80752563476562
24718/28840	The darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the Venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the	150.69313049316406
24719/28840	About this time the nurses cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her	51.86591339111328
24720/28840	To the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentines condition but to this hireling Valentine only appeared to	128.22842407226562
24721/28840	Good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is threequarters	172.7356719970703
24722/28840	Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by Valentines sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more	77.400390625
24723/28840	Astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards Valentine and for the first time noticed the white	88.19092559814453
24724/28840	She tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sickn	97.50025177001953
24725/28840	She screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed   Help help   50083m       What is the matter asked	25.430973052978516
24726/28840	dAvrigny at the foot of the stairs it being the hour he usually visited	78.13324737548828
24727/28840	What is it asked Villefort rushing from his	40.81734848022461
24728/28840	Doctor do you hear them call for help   Yes yes let us hasten up it was in Valentines	39.1455192565918
24729/28840	But before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by light	71.39804077148438
24730/28840	Call Madame de VillefortWake Madame de Villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to	30.99319839477539
24731/28840	But instead of obeying him the servants stood watching	195.82476806640625
24732/28840	dAvrigny who ran to Valentine and raised her in his	48.72768783569336
24733/28840	Oh where will be the end   Villefort rushed into the	23.31509017944336
24734/28840	What are you saying doctor he exclaimed raising his hands to	91.46186065673828
24735/28840	I say that Valentine is dead replied dAvrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calm	40.68044662475586
24736/28840	50085m      	19.76694679260254
24737/28840	de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the	40.572139739990234
24738/28840	Just then Madame de Villefort in the act of slipping on her dressinggown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious	45.4752082824707
24739/28840	On a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the	141.8684539794922
24740/28840	She saw dAvrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the	67.11477661132812
24741/28840	It was now a third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the	108.1903076171875
24742/28840	The spectre of Valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her	211.67459106445312
24743/28840	It was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which Valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive	58.08241271972656
24744/28840	dAvrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the	152.54244995117188
24745/28840	Ah exclaimed dAvrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a	38.344139099121094
24746/28840	Madame de Villefort was overpowered her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and	57.54103469848633
24747/28840	Directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and Villefort was still absorbed in	80.34142303466797
24748/28840	dAvrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his eyes and watched her hurried	42.17093276977539
24749/28840	He lifted up the drapery over the entrance to Edwards room and his eye reaching as far as Madame de Villeforts apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the	73.60547637939453
24750/28840	Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort he said to the	16.53651237487793
24751/28840	50087m       But Mademoiselle de Villefort stammered the	13.82702922821045
24752/28840	Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help said dAvrigny since she is	14.659517288208008
24753/28840	Deaddead groaned forth Villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that	67.8468017578125
24754/28840	Who said Valentine was dead   The two men turned round and saw Morrel standing at the door pale and terrorstr	42.32050323486328
24755/28840	At the usual time Morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtiers	32.15900421142578
24756/28840	Contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he	225.0336151123047
24757/28840	He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to	62.36785125732422
24758/28840	Noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the	100.23168182373047
24759/28840	Morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his	63.16344451904297
24760/28840	Every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by Noirt	69.1996078491211
24761/28840	Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no	203.45191955566406
24762/28840	Noirtiers room was opened like all the	94.8187026977539
24763/28840	The first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his	64.3666763305664
24764/28840	How are you sir asked Morrel with a sickness of	37.33045959472656
24765/28840	Well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested increasing uneas	63.63307571411133
24766/28840	You are thoughtful sir continued Morrel you want something shall I call one of the servants   Yes replied Noirt	37.951438903808594
24767/28840	Morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one	419.30438232421875
24768/28840	He turned towards Noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily	89.28195190429688
24769/28840	Oh exclaimed Morrel why do they not come Is anyone ill in the house The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from their	68.79641723632812
24770/28840	What is the matter You alarm	87.90274810791016
24771/28840	Valentine Valentine   Yes yes signed Noirt	25.508543014526367
24772/28840	Maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wains	66.3187255859375
24773/28840	Yes yes yes continued the old	42.5010871887207
24774/28840	50089m       Maximilian rushed up the little staircase while Noirtiers eyes seemed to sayQuicker quicker   In a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached Valent	48.82107925415039
24775/28840	There was no occasion to push the door it was wide	93.46923828125
24776/28840	A sob was the only sound he	132.65965270996094
24777/28840	He saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white draper	117.88568115234375
24778/28840	Maximilian   Villefort rose halfashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of	37.61140823364258
24779/28840	The terrible office he had held for twentyfive years had succeeded in making him more or less than	103.48934936523438
24780/28840	His glance at first wandering fixed itself upon Mor	241.82701110839844
24781/28840	Godo you hear said Villefort while dAvrigny advanced to lead Morrel	41.852542877197266
24782/28840	Morrel was seen carrying with superhuman strength the armchair containing Noirtier	257.91497802734375
24783/28840	When he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into Valentines	67.5099868774414
24784/28840	This could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful	204.40020751953125
24785/28840	But the most fearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other	115.38125610351562
24786/28840	That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort like a frightful appar	83.91667938232422
24787/28840	Each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had	105.41300964355469
24788/28840	See what they have done cried Morrel with one hand leaning on the back of the chair and the other extended towards	66.1186294555664
24789/28840	See my father see   Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called Noirtier his	37.620018005371094
24790/28840	And the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speaka cry frightful in its	350.80596923828125
24791/28840	DAvrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful rest	153.93875122070312
24792/28840	Sir cried Morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who I am and what right I have to be	72.94026947021484
24793/28840	Oh you know it tell them tell them And the young mans voice was choked by so	158.613525390625
24794/28840	As for the old man his chest heaved with his panting resp	77.89608764648438
24795/28840	One could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding	102.75206756591797
24796/28840	At length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of Noirt	66.3253402709961
24797/28840	Tell them said Morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that I am her betrot	29.222808837890625
24798/28840	Tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the	184.45338439941406
24799/28840	Tell themoh tell them that corpse belongs to me   The young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive	85.67569732666016
24800/28840	But Morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of Valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the	129.9314727783203
24801/28840	For some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and	90.1668930053711
24802/28840	At length Villefort the most composed of all spoke   Sir said he to Maximilian you say you loved Valentine that you were betrothed to	51.6209602355957
24803/28840	I knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet I her father forgive you for I see that your grief is real and deep and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my	110.48189544677734
24804/28840	But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earthshe has nothing more to do with the adoration of	86.03543090820312
24805/28840	Take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her	276.3667907714844
24806/28840	Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the	142.3289337158203

24808/28840	What do you mean sir asked Villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of Mor	30.12871551513672
24809/28840	I tell you sir that two persons exist in you the father has mourned sufficiently now let the procureur fulfil his	141.8795623779297
24810/28840	The eyes of Noirtier glistened and dAvrigny	15.317570686340332
24811/28840	Now sir continued Morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like	155.2520751953125
24812/28840	le Procureur du Roi said Morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed I denounce the crime it is your place to seek the	117.86881256103516
24813/28840	The young mans implacable eyes interrogated Villefort who on his side glanced from Noirtier to dAvrign	41.611122131347656
24814/28840	But instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of Maximil	41.394771575927734
24815/28840	Sir said Villefort striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotionsir you are deceived no one commits crimes	115.74141693115234
24816/28840	It is horrible indeed but no one assass	124.67832946777344
24817/28840	The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage and dAvrigny prepared to	26.58157730102539
24818/28840	Morrel however extended his arm and commanded	545.7964477539062
24819/28840	And I say that murders _are_ committed here said Morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four	169.5555419921875
24820/28840	I tell you Valentines life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of	108.71002197265625

24822/28840	I tell you that you know these things as well as I do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a	42.56293869018555
24823/28840	Oh you rave sir exclaimed Villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was	49.56190872192383
24824/28840	50095m       I rave said Morrel well then I appeal to	49.467796325683594
24825/28840	Ask him sir if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of Madame de SaintMérans	28.7117977142334
24826/28840	You thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of	217.16018676757812
24827/28840	Yes yes continued Morrel recall the scene for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my	234.3829803466797
24828/28840	Certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by	277.8329162597656
24829/28840	de Villefort towards his own relations I ought to have denounced him to the authorities then I should not have been an accomplice to thy death as I now am sweet beloved Valentine but the accomplice shall become the aven	79.64241027832031
24830/28840	This fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee Valentine it is I and I swear it that shall pursue the	257.0277099609375
24831/28840	And I too he exclaimed in a low voice I unite with	84.87545776367188
24832/28840	Morrel in demanding justice for crime my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly	253.56149291992188
24833/28840	Morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre   Stay he said	59.82941436767578
24834/28840	Yes indicated Noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his	85.4354019165039
24835/28840	Do you know the assassin asked Mor	39.647987365722656
24836/28840	And will you direct us exclaimed the young	121.52289581298828
24837/28840	dAvrigny listen   Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made Valentine happy and thus fixed his	41.101314544677734
24838/28840	Then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the	108.80674743652344
24839/28840	Do you wish me to leave said Morrel	37.66602325439453
24840/28840	Alas alas sir have pity on me   The old mans eyes remained fixed on the	43.6239128112793
24841/28840	May I at least return asked Mor	131.83274841308594
24842/28840	Must I leave alone  	104.12606048583984
24843/28840	Whom am I to take with me The procureur  	101.30960845947266
24844/28840	You wish to remain alone with	85.75875091552734
24845/28840	But can he understand you  	40.69196319580078
24846/28840	Oh said Villefort inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him aloneoh be satisfied I can understand my	80.23216247558594
24847/28840	While uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together	126.96302032470703
24848/28840	DAvrigny took the young mans arm and led him out of the	99.99976348876953
24849/28840	A more than deathlike silence then reigned in the	106.04420471191406
24850/28840	At the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where dAvrigny and Morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in	29.87856101989746
24851/28840	You can come he said and led them back to Noirt	40.81198501586914
24852/28840	His face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to	84.36479187011719
24853/28840	Gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves The two men drew	134.63987731933594
24854/28840	But said Morrel the culpritthe murdererthe	304.41778564453125

24857/28840	Do you not father   Yes resolutely replied Noirt	48.28609085083008
24858/28840	Morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape	119.94200134277344
24859/28840	Oh sir said Villefort arresting Maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that Valentine will be terribly reven	60.18439483642578
24860/28840	Is it not so father   The old man made a sign in the	26.023571014404297
24861/28840	Villefort continued   He knows me and I have pledged my word to	39.98038864135742
24862/28840	Noirtier asked Morrel while dAvrigny looked inquiring	16.02598762512207
24863/28840	Yes replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister	28.920228958129883
24864/28840	Swear then said Villefort joining the hands of Morrel and dAvrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my	35.83447265625
24865/28840	DAvrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble Yes but Morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and	144.56912231445312
24866/28840	We have before stated that all the servants had	119.9257583618164
24867/28840	de Villefort was therefore obliged to request	56.63762664794922
24868/28840	dAvrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city more especially a death under such suspicious	161.71945190429688
24869/28840	It was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of Noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his	113.40556335449219
24870/28840	Villefort retired to his study and dAvrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine bodies after decease and who is expressly named the doctor of the	74.26410675048828
24871/28840	Noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grand	46.38629150390625
24872/28840	At the end of a quarter of an hour	18.478336334228516
24873/28840	dAvrigny returned with his associate they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house Villefort himself was obliged to open to	75.6552734375
24874/28840	But he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death	147.2975311279297
24875/28840	The two doctors therefore entered the room	346.79998779296875
24876/28840	Noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the	79.78449249267578
24877/28840	The district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the	168.3282470703125
24878/28840	Alas said dAvrigny she is indeed dead poor child   50099m       Yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had	28.909507751464844
24879/28840	Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound the old mans eyes sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his	52.50885772705078
24880/28840	He therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping	102.35069274902344
24881/28840	A tear which appeared in the old mans eye expressed his thanks to the	80.24520874023438
24882/28840	The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and having fulfilled his duty was conducted out by dAvrign	69.4798583984375
24883/28840	Villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to dAvrigny and said   And now the	47.904502868652344
24884/28840	Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine asked dAvrign	73.57943725585938
24885/28840	The nearest said the district doctor is a good Italian abbé who lives next door to	167.21873474121094
24886/28840	Shall I call on him as I pass   DAvrigny said Villefort be so kind I beseech you as to accompany this	34.967681884765625

24891/28840	For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflict	1026.0465087890625
24892/28840	As the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next	93.21189880371094
24893/28840	This is the abbé of whom I spoke said the doctor to dAvrign	19.03339195251465
24894/28840	Sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter I mean	170.28167724609375

24896/28840	Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of	120.1711654663086
24897/28840	I was about to offer myself sir said the priest it is our mission to forestall our	237.16310119628906
24898/28840	I know it sir the servants who fled from the house informed	228.962890625
24899/28840	I also know that her name is Valentine and I have already prayed for	130.70606994628906
24900/28840	Thank you sir said dAvrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue	95.07023620605469

24902/28840	I am going sir and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than	116.24895477294922
24903/28840	DAvrigny took the priests hand and without meeting Villefort who was engaged in his study they reached Valentines room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undert	182.0924530029297
24904/28840	On entering the room Noirtiers eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the	76.08118438720703
24905/28840	DAvrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to Valentine and his attentions to Noirt	128.9798126220703
24906/28840	In order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as dAvrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to Madame de Villeforts	120.90000915527344
24907/28840	Danglars Signature   The next morning dawned dull and	428.9027404785156
24908/28840	During the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the windingsheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in	342.09832763671875
24909/28840	This windingsheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought a fortnight	124.80460357666016
24910/28840	During the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried Noirtier from Valentines room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his	138.3426055908203

24913/28840	They found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling	273.42340087890625
24914/28840	They both stood in amazement at the	92.54325103759766
24915/28840	See said dAvrigny to Villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest	60.00947189331055
24916/28840	Noirtier did not love his child and yet he	118.74236297607422
24917/28840	Yes you are right replied Villefort surprised he sleeps indeed And this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all	475.9831237792969
24918/28840	Grief has stunned him replied dAvrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureurs	198.04278564453125
24919/28840	See I have not slept said Villefort showing his undisturbed bed grief does not stun	326.49993896484375
24920/28840	I have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what I have written during these two days and	129.8162384033203
24921/28840	I have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin Benedet	161.82752990722656

24926/28840	I shall work doctorwhen I work I forget	2491.475830078125
24927/28840	And indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in	218.746337890625
24928/28840	On the doorsteps dAvrigny met the cousin whom Villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupiedone of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to	206.7621612548828
24929/28840	He was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousins with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be	399.0964050292969
24930/28840	Gradually the receptionroom filled and some of our old friends made their appearancewe mean Debray ChâteauRenaud and Beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for	164.5490264892578

24938/28840	Have you mentioned this death in your paper   It has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed I doubt if it will please	165.6883087158203
24939/28840	Villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the kings attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about	353.3730163574219
24940/28840	dAvrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about	458.5690612792969
24941/28840	But whom are you seeking Debray   I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo said the young	26.215417861938477

24945/28840	I believe so replied the secretary with slight uneas	75.19964599609375
24946/28840	But Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here I do not see Mor	58.43605422973633
24947/28840	Morrel Do they know him asked ChâteauRen	53.277706146240234
24948/28840	I think he has only been introduced to Madame de Ville	22.196949005126953
24949/28840	Still he ought to have been here said Debray I wonder what will be talked about tonight this funeral is the news of the	94.3626937866211
24950/28840	But hush here comes our minister of justice he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to	243.8170166015625
24951/28840	Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met Monte Cristo who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la Chaussée dAntin to	42.85500717163086
24952/28840	The banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable	198.3509979248047
24953/28840	Well said he extending his hand to Monte Cristo I suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my	55.31461715698242
24954/28840	When I perceived you I was just asking myself whether I had not wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of He who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them	564.7794799804688
24955/28840	Well on my word of honor I answered No I wished no ill to Morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our	174.21725463867188
24956/28840	Do you know count that persons of our time of lifenot that you belong to the class you are still a young manbut as I was saying persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this	243.76702880859375

24958/28840	Oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children   Do you think so   Indeed I	58.425777435302734
24959/28840	And so Mademoiselle Danglars   She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to	50.54555130004883
24960/28840	And is she gone   The other night she	151.02359008789062

24968/28840	There was a moments silence during which the noise of the bankers pen was alone heard while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the	92.3746109008789
24969/28840	Are they Spanish Haitian or Neapolitan bonds said Monte Crist	247.47572326660156
24970/28840	No said Danglars smiling they are bonds on the bank of France payable to	278.32513427734375
24971/28840	Please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my	299.37353515625
24972/28840	One two three four five said Monte Cristo five millionswhy what a Crœsus you are   This is how I transact business said Dangl	379.8170166015625
24973/28840	It is really wonderful said the count above all if as I suppose it is payable at	163.55758666992188
24974/28840	It is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in France these things are	111.50775909423828
24975/28840	Five millions on five little scraps of paperit must be seen to be	1314.9090576171875
24976/28840	You do not doubt it   No   You say so with an accentstay you shall be convinced take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the Treasury for the same	140.2333526611328
24977/28840	No said Monte Cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious I will make the experiment	368.5980224609375
24978/28840	I am credited on you for six	485.0633239746094
24979/28840	I have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand franc	57.868003845214844
24980/28840	I will take the five scraps of paper that I now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between	390.21826171875
24981/28840	I had prepared it beforehand for I am much in want of money	206.8689727783203
24982/28840	And Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to Dangl	44.022037506103516
24983/28840	If a thunderbolt had fallen at the bankers feet he could not have experienced greater	152.15997314453125
24984/28840	What he stammered do you mean to keep that money Excuse me excuse me but I owe this money to the charity funda deposit which I promised to pay this	216.8201904296875
24985/28840	But here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards Danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its	672.755859375
24986/28840	Suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed count	285.4626770019531
24987/28840	50109m       Certainly he said your receipt is	65.43675994873047
24988/28840	Oh dear yes and if you were at Rome the house of Thomson  French would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just	159.07540893554688
24989/28840	Then I may keep this money   Yes said Danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his	38.53719711303711
24990/28840	Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say Come reflect if you repent there is still	169.68812561035156
24991/28840	No said Danglars no decidedly no keep my	395.4978942871094
24992/28840	But you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business I intended this money for the charity fund and I seemed to be robbing them if I did not pay them with these precise	935.7744140625
24993/28840	How absurdas if one crown were not as good as	663.19677734375
24994/28840	Excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but	1259.2413330078125
24995/28840	Certainly I excuse you said Monte Cristo graciously and pocket	83.90707397460938
24996/28840	And he placed the bonds in his pocket	109.03006744384766
24997/28840	But said Danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs   Oh a mere nothing said Monte Crist	25.660057067871094
24998/28840	The balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be qu	376.60693359375
24999/28840	Count said Danglars are you speaking seriously   I never joke with bankers said Monte Cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced  	75.12602996826172
25000/28840	_Ma foi_ said Monte Cristo I think I arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with	112.63790893554688
25001/28840	Danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count	48.14253234863281
25002/28840	Monte Cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with	1334.4427490234375
25003/28840	de Boville who was standing in the waitingroom and who was introduced into Danglars room as soon as the count had	51.95526885986328
25004/28840	The counts serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receivergeneral held in his	457.0169982910156
25005/28840	At the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the	85.10536193847656
25006/28840	Meanwhile Danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver	1235.677490234375
25007/28840	We need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his	179.1996307373047
25008/28840	Goodmorning creditor said he for I wager anything it is the creditor who visits	1049.7406005859375
25009/28840	de Boville the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from	561.1016845703125
25010/28840	And yet they say orphans are to be pitied said Danglars wishing to prolong the j	207.21728515625
25011/28840	Poor things   Here I am in their name said	79.05990600585938
25012/28840	de Boville but did you receive my letter yesterday  	79.55322265625
25013/28840	50111m       My dear	13.6605806350708
25014/28840	de Boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twentyfour hours since	670.9612426757812
25015/28840	de Monte Cristo whom you just saw leaving hereyou did see him I think   Yes well   Well	116.8291015625
25016/28840	de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five	106.44103240966797
25017/28840	How so   The count has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by Thomson  French of Rome he came to demand five millions at once which I paid him with checks on the	159.22726440429688
25018/28840	My funds are deposited there and you can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the	169.7554473876953
25019/28840	Two days will be a different thing said Danglars	54.98251724243164
25020/28840	Come said Boville with a tone of entire incredulity five millions to that gentleman who just left and who bowed to me as though he knew me   Perhaps he knows you though you do not know him	114.99644470214844
25021/28840	Five millions   Here is his	294.0575256347656
25022/28840	de Boville took the paper Danglars presented him and read   Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson  French of	80.91724395751953
25023/28840	Do you know the house of Thomson  French   Yes I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200000 francs but since then I have not heard it	55.13694381713867
25024/28840	It is one of the best houses in Europe said Danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his	71.08155059814453
25025/28840	de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary	895.1769409179688
25026/28840	I must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from	352.2866516113281
25027/28840	Oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to 20000 francs a	365.1884765625
25028/28840	It is magnificent I will set before him the example of Madame de Morcerf and her	51.899559020996094
25029/28840	What example   They gave all their fortune to the	607.129150390625
25030/28840	For what reason   Because they would not spend money so guiltily	600.3294067382812
25031/28840	And what are they to live upon   The mother retires into the country and the son enters the	359.7227478027344
25032/28840	50113m       Well I must confess these are scru	34.49728012084961
25033/28840	I registered their deed of gift	18389.923828125
25034/28840	And how much did they possess   Oh not muchfrom twelve to thirteen hundred thousand franc	222.15516662597656
25035/28840	Certainly said Danglars in the most natural tone in the	18.533428192138672
25036/28840	Are you then pressed for this money   Yes for the examination of our cash takes place	232.22930908203125
25037/28840	Tomorrow Why did you not tell me so before Why it is as good as a century At what hour does the examination take place   At two o	110.0877456665039
25038/28840	de Boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the	124.11943054199219
25039/28840	Now I think of it you can do better said Dangl	21.260221481323242
25040/28840	How do you mean   The receipt of	45.85127639770508
25041/28840	de Monte Cristo is as good as money take it to Rothschilds or Lafittes and they will take it off your hands at	253.610107421875
25042/28840	What though payable at Rome   Certainly it will only cost you a discount of 5000 or 6000 franc	559.0805053710938
25043/28840	_Ma foi_ he said I prefer waiting till	159.42881774902344
25044/28840	What a proposition   I thought perhaps said Danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up   Indeed said the	138.81646728515625
25045/28840	And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some	105.31101989746094
25046/28840	Ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be	862.2780151367188
25047/28840	Better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing	84.03607940673828
25048/28840	How were you to blame in that affair   Listenwhen one bears an irreproachable name as I do one is rather	434.172119140625
25049/28840	Everybody pities you sir and above all Mademoiselle Danglars   Poor Eugénie said Danglars do you know she is going to embrace a religious life  	35.92342758178711
25050/28840	Alas it is unhappily but too	365.40673828125
25051/28840	The day after the event she decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in Italy or	347.3861999511719
25052/28840	de Boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the	571.5123291015625
25053/28840	Then he doublelocked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in banknotes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed   To Madame la Baronne Dangl	317.1662902832031
25054/28840	I will place it on her table myself tonight he murm	204.54986572265625
25055/28840	Then taking a passport from his drawer he saidGood it is available for two months	824.0431518554688
25056/28840	The Cemetery of PèreLachaise  	51.17863845825195
25057/28840	de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking Valentine to her last home on	255.0854949951172
25058/28840	The weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulev	472.14208984375
25059/28840	de Villefort a true Parisian considered the cemetery of PèreLachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a Parisian family there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy	327.39825439453125
25060/28840	He had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his	315.45751953125
25061/28840	On the front of the monument was inscribed The families of SaintMéran and Villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor Renée Valentines	128.78346252441406
25062/28840	The pompous procession therefore wended its way towards PèreLachaise from the Faubourg SaintHonor	78.59333038330078
25063/28840	Having crossed Paris it passed through the Faubourg du Temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the	508.4278259277344
25064/28840	More than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourningcoaches and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on	413.4587097167969
25065/28840	As they left Paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained Monte Crist	176.34326171875
25066/28840	The count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on	138.59866333007812
25067/28840	ChâteauRenaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his _coupé_ joined him Beauchamp did the	45.02168273925781
25068/28840	The count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in	391.5210876464844
25069/28840	50119m       Where is Morrel he asked do either of these gentlemen know where he is   We have already asked that question said ChâteauRenaud for none of us has seen	45.29545211791992
25070/28840	The count was silent but continued to gaze around	317.335693359375
25071/28840	At length they arrived at the	114.27774047851562
25072/28840	The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yewtrees Monte Cristo recognized him whom he	543.9408569335938
25073/28840	One funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent met	2165.99560546875
25074/28840	Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else	319.5508117675781
25075/28840	Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his	257.324951171875
25076/28840	Everything was conducted in the usual	95.88713073730469
25077/28840	Monte Cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw Morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his	120.84646606445312
25078/28840	See said Beauchamp pointing out Morrel to Debr	34.79593276977539
25079/28840	What is he doing up there And they called ChâteauRenauds attention to	72.6744384765625
25080/28840	How pale he is said ChâteauRenaud shudder	35.05021286010742
25081/28840	Not at all said ChâteauRenaud slowly I think he is violently	51.97319030761719
25082/28840	Bah said Debray he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort you said so	24.77149772644043
25083/28840	Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de Morcer	98.72964477539062
25084/28840	The discourse is over farewell gentlemen said the count unceremon	865.6672973632812
25085/28840	And he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he	470.11328125
25086/28840	The funeral being over the guests returned to	406.7398986816406
25087/28840	ChâteauRenaud looked for a moment for Morrel but while they were watching the departure of the count Morrel had quitted his post and ChâteauRenaud failing in his search joined Debray and Beauch	38.80718994140625
25088/28840	Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of Morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and work	276.1831359863281
25089/28840	Morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unper	237.1055450439453
25090/28840	The count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon Morrel upon the first	458.0524597167969
25091/28840	Monte Cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for Morrel turning round said calmly   You see I was	219.85299682617188
25092/28840	The scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to	137.37274169921875
25093/28840	Shall I drive you back to Paris he	216.64501953125
25094/28840	Do you wish anything   Leave me to	103.3302230834961
25095/28840	The count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards Paris without once looking	222.105712890625
25096/28840	He walked slowly down the Rue de la Roqu	971.6715087890625
25097/28840	The count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces	374.7925109863281
25098/28840	Maximilian crossed the canal and entered the Rue Meslay by the boulev	196.56581115722656
25099/28840	Five minutes after the door had been closed on Morrels entrance it was again opened for the	85.36531829833984
25100/28840	Julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching Penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some Bengal	552.2909545898438
25101/28840	Ah count she exclaimed with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the Rue Mes	152.96826171875
25102/28840	Maximilian has just returned has he not madame asked the	84.66422271728516
25103/28840	50123m       Yes I think I saw him pass but pray call	48.71474838256836
25104/28840	Excuse me madame but I must go up to Maximilians room this instant replied Monte Cristo I have something of the greatest importance to tell	45.363853454589844
25105/28840	Go then she said with a charming smile which accompanied him until he had	61.752037048339844
25106/28840	Monte Cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to Maximilians room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was	168.99505615234375
25107/28840	Like many old houses occupied by a single family the room door was panelled with glass but it was locked Maximilian was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because a red curtain was drawn before the	229.1282501220703
25108/28840	The counts anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable	206.5342559814453
25109/28840	What shall I do he uttered and reflected for a moment shall I ring No the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in Maximilians situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder	398.3275451660156
25110/28840	I beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my	164.81051635742188
25111/28840	Since it is opened I will take advantage of it to enter your room do not disturb yourselfdo not disturb yourself   And passing his hand through the broken glass the count opened the	106.08826446533203
25112/28840	Morrel evidently discomposed came to meet Monte Cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his	195.9095001220703
25113/28840	_Ma foi_ said Monte Cristo rubbing his elbow its all your servants fault your stairs are so polished it is like walking on	389.29107666015625
25114/28840	Are you hurt sir coldly asked Mor	402.06298828125

25118/28840	Monte Cristo advanced into the room Maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed	85.53943634033203
25119/28840	You were writing said Monte Cristo with a searching	65.42084503173828

25121/28840	Your pistols are beside your desk said Monte Cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the	118.04520416259766
25122/28840	I am on the point of starting on a journey replied Morrel disdain	47.61959457397461
25123/28840	My friend exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite	57.55648422241211
25124/28840	Sir   My friend my dear Maximilian do not make a hasty resolution I entreat	21.89299774169922
25125/28840	I make a hasty resolution said Morrel shrugging his shoulders is there anything extraordinary in a journey   50125m       Maximilian said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have	59.903892517089844
25126/28840	You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I impose upon you with my frivolous solicit	577.0323486328125
25127/28840	Morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but Monte Cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron	216.51953125
25128/28840	You wish to destroy yourself said the count you have written	57.38706970214844
25129/28840	It is a mercy to let me die for if I live I shall lose my reason and become	83.10508728027344
25130/28840	Morrel   Yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and I will do so be satisfied When you spoke to me at the cemetery I answered youmy heart was softened when you arrived here I allowed you to	128.1785430908203
25131/28840	And I again repeat you shall not commit	767.1051635742188
25132/28840	Prevent me then replied Morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the counts iron	452.5130615234375
25133/28840	50127m       And who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings   Who am I repeated Monte Crist	354.5232238769531
25134/28840	Morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte Crist	297.9764099121094
25135/28840	Julie Emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of Maximil	189.4617919921875
25136/28840	Julie threw herself into the arms of the count Emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel Morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his	162.64141845703125
25137/28840	Then the ironhearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and we	219.77659606933594
25138/28840	For a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to	453.2758483886719
25139/28840	Listen my friends said the countI may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven yearsthe discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never	141.00210571289062
25140/28840	I wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother Maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now I am	190.58091735839844
25141/28840	Then turning around and seeing that Morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing Emmanuels hand significantly Watch over	239.63453674316406
25142/28840	Why so asked the young man	155.8890838623047
25143/28840	I cannot explain myself but watch over	222.3370361328125
25144/28840	Emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to	86.46825408935547
25145/28840	Then walking towards Morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stup	128.38363647460938
25146/28840	Julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the	1464.1080322265625
25147/28840	While announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on Morrel and remarked that the words I shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his letharg	88.75691223144531
25148/28840	He then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of Emmanuel and Julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father   My kind friends leave me alone with Maximil	149.10995483398438
25149/28840	Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which Monte Cristo had	635.0476684570312
25150/28840	She drew her husband to the	75.0169906616211
25151/28840	The count was alone with Morrel who remained motionless as a	49.654232025146484
25152/28840	Come said MonteCristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again Maximilian   Yes for I begin to suffer	170.5386962890625
25153/28840	The count frowned apparently in gloomy	5719.44189453125
25154/28840	Maximilian Maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a	96.57801055908203
25155/28840	Oh do not fear my friend said Morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count I shall no longer attempt my	51.427371978759766
25156/28840	Then we are to have no more pistolsno more despair   No I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a	223.99900817871094
25157/28840	Poor fellow what is it   My grief will kill me of	123.06031036376953
25158/28840	My friend said Monte Cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to	38.62192153930664
25159/28840	One day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution I also wished to kill myself one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself	261.2015686035156
25160/28840	Look at me said Monte Cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasivelook at	130.68357849121094
25161/28840	There are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet I see you sufferyou Maximilian whom I love as my own	224.09173583984375
25162/28840	Well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond Now if I entreat if I order you to live Morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your	151.30564880371094
25163/28840	Oh heavens said the young man oh heavenswhat are you saying count Take	332.79351806640625
25164/28840	But perhaps you have never loved   Child replied the	117.14148712158203
25165/28840	You see I have been a soldier ever since I attained man	1183.63671875
25166/28840	I reached the age of twentynine without loving for none of the feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of	1089.6983642578125
25167/28840	Well at twentynine I saw Valentine for two years I have loved her for two years I have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and	272.4617614746094
25168/28840	Count to possess Valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without Valentine the earth is	1139.343017578125
25169/28840	I have told you to hope said the	34.58962631225586
25170/28840	Then have a care I repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed I should lose my reason for I should hope that I could again behold	145.57521057128906
25171/28840	My friend my father said Morrel with excitement have a care I again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms	644.6432495117188
25172/28840	Weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural	957.8875122070312
25173/28840	I must obey you though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the	334.28857421875
25174/28840	Ah said Morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despairah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy	535.27294921875
25175/28840	No my friend I was wrong to caution you do not fear I will bury my grief so deep in my heart I will disguise it so that you shall not even care to sympathize with	113.36954498291016
25176/28840	Adieu my friend adieu   On the contrary said the count after this time you must live with meyou must not leave me and in a week we shall have left France behind	66.9364013671875
25177/28840	And you still bid me hope   I tell you to hope because I have a method of curing	223.54254150390625
25178/28840	Count you render me sadder than before if it be	428.3905334472656

25180/28840	And Morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredul	184.6345672607422
25181/28840	What can I say more asked Monte Crist	49.83496856689453
25182/28840	I have confidence in the remedy I propose and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its	226.70904541015625
25183/28840	Or take care Morrel lest I call you ungr	120.21685028076172
25184/28840	Will you promise me   Yes for I am a man and have suffered like yourself and also contemplated suicide indeed often since misfortune has left me I have longed for the delights of an eternal	197.98028564453125
25185/28840	But you are sure you will promise me this said Morrel	86.43618774414062
25186/28840	I not only promise but swear it said Monte Cristo extending his	64.0091552734375
25187/28840	I do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of September it is ten years today since I saved your fathers life who wished to	54.77769088745117
25188/28840	Morrel seized the counts hand and kissed it the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to	136.2161865234375
25189/28840	In a month you will find on the table at which we shall be then sitting good pistols and a delicious draught but on the other hand you must promise me not to attempt your life before that	167.07638549804688
25190/28840	Oh I also swear it   Monte Cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his	43.64463424682617
25191/28840	And now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy Haydées apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my	143.8016357421875
25192/28840	Haydée said Morrel what has become of her   She departed last	56.82346725463867
25193/28840	To leave you   To wait for	45.71794509887695
25194/28840	Hold yourself ready then to join me at the ChampsÉlysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my	92.28009033203125
25195/28840	Maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike	460.2613525390625
25196/28840	Dividing the Proceeds   The apartment on the first floor of the house in the Rue SaintGermaindesPrés where Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious	205.68687438964844
25197/28840	Contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his _incognito_ was strictly	248.5433807373047
25198/28840	His visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four oclock though he never spent the night	436.4656066894531
25199/28840	At halfpast three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same	162.82470703125
25200/28840	At four oclock as we have already stated the mysterious personage	78.69042205810547
25201/28840	Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light	279.91278076171875
25202/28840	No one ever asked her where she was	129.82278442382812
25203/28840	Her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for	773.3756713867188
25204/28840	We need not say she stopped at the first	99.25047302246094
25205/28840	Then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door which after being opened to admit her was again fastened and curiosity penetrated no	321.89447021484375
25206/28840	They used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the	429.6064453125
25207/28840	The lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handker	162.80569458007812
25208/28840	The day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten oclock in the morning instead of four in the	71.89543151855469
25209/28840	Almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily	828.732421875
25210/28840	Well what is the matter my dear asked the gentleman whose name the ladys agitation revealed tell me what is the	99.8549575805664
25211/28840	Oh Lucien can I confide in you   Of course you know you can do	60.8001708984375
25212/28840	But what can be the matter Your note of this morning has completely bewildered	263.4656677246094
25213/28840	Come ease me of my anxiety or else frighten me at	541.1184692382812
25214/28840	Lucien a great event has happened said the lady glancing inquiringly at Lucien	108.05023193359375
25215/28840	Danglars left last night   Left	615.6273193359375
25216/28840	Danglars left Where has he gone   I do not	30.030179977416992
25217/28840	Then what did you mean   Stayhe left a letter for	104.0747299194336
25218/28840	A letter   Yes read	120.73616790771484
25219/28840	And the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to Debr	38.387779235839844
25220/28840	Debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might	398.33099365234375
25221/28840	No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows   Madame and most faithful	78.13555908203125
25222/28840	Debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with bl	113.52485656738281
25223/28840	Debray continued   When you receive this you will no longer have a	77.25331115722656
25224/28840	Oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of	94.68419647216797
25225/28840	I owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me I will give	126.03874969482422
25226/28840	I received this morning five millions which I paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me I put this creditor off till tomorrow and I intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to	305.41357421875
25227/28840	For women have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but I who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived	516.6812133789062
25228/28840	Have you admired the rapidity of my fall Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots I confess I have seen nothing but the fire let us hope you have found some gold among the	233.59646606445312
25229/28840	With this consoling idea I leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you you have friends left and the ashes I have already mentioned and above all the liberty I hasten to restore to	271.49090576171875
25230/28840	And here madame I must add another word of	302.6257019042969
25231/28840	So long as I hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter I philosophically closed my eyes but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin I will not be the foundation of another mans	178.82276916503906
25232/28840	You were rich when I married you but little	476.28826904296875
25233/28840	Excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves I do not see why I should weigh my	226.44229125976562
25234/28840	I have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned itwithout any fault of mine I can honestly	1050.7301025390625
25235/28840	You madame have only sought to increase your own and I am convinced that you have	71.94904327392578
25236/28840	I leave you therefore as I took yourich but little	928.595703125
25237/28840	Adieu I also intend from this time to work on my own	141.50497436523438
25238/28840	Accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which I intend	1991.2720947265625
25239/28840	Your very devoted husband   Baron Dangl	47.832672119140625
25240/28840	The baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his selfcontrol change color once or	239.64356994628906
25241/28840	When he had ended the perusal he folded the letter and resumed his pensive	236.63275146484375
25242/28840	Well asked Madame Danglars with an anxiety easy to be	38.679569244384766
25243/28840	With what ideas does that letter inspire you   Oh it is simple enough madame it inspires me with the idea that	193.44711303710938
25244/28840	Certainly but is this all you have to say to me   I do not understand you said Debray with freezing cold	47.138736724853516
25245/28840	He is gone Gone never to return   Oh madame do not think that   I tell you he will never	75.73204803466797
25246/28840	I know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own	324.4412536621094
25247/28840	Debray instead of answering allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous	220.4871063232422
25248/28840	Well she said at length do you not answer me   I have but one question to ask youwhat do you intend to do   I was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating	36.06230926513672
25249/28840	Ah then you wish to ask advice of me   Yes I do wish to ask your advice said Madame Danglars with anxious	49.46469497680664
25250/28840	Then if you wish to take my advice said the young man coldly I would recommend you to	39.77134323120117
25251/28840	Danglars says you are rich and perfectly	81.81546020507812
25252/28840	In my opinion a withdrawal from Paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of Mademoiselle Danglars broken contract and	154.31776428222656
25253/28840	The world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of op	500.5587463378906
25254/28840	You have only to remain in Paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the	290.760986328125
25255/28840	Then you can quit your house leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyones mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterested	495.9761047363281
25256/28840	They will know you are deserted and think you also poor for I alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest	382.3824157714844
25257/28840	The dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which Debray had	167.2126007080078
25258/28840	Deserted she repeated ah yes I am indeed deserted You are right sir and no one can doubt my	487.6370544433594
25259/28840	These were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to Debr	909.38671875
25260/28840	50137m       But then you are richvery rich indeed continued Debray taking out some papers from his pocketbook which he spread upon the	104.8196029663086
25261/28840	Madame Danglars did not see them she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush	110.19400024414062
25262/28840	At length a sense of dignity prevailed and if she did not entirely master her agitation she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single	370.0436706542969
25263/28840	Madame said Debray it is nearly six months since we have been	92.27116394042969
25264/28840	You furnished a principal of 100000 franc	176.28407287597656
25265/28840	Our partnership began in the month of	542.2604370117188
25266/28840	In May we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained 450000 franc	443.8978576660156
25267/28840	In June the profit amounted to 900	6786.806640625
25268/28840	In July we added 1700000 francsit was you know the month of the Spanish	1015.5870361328125
25269/28840	Now madame said Debray delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker there are still 80000 francs the interest of this money in my	204.37506103515625
25270/28840	But said the baroness I thought you never put the money out to	73.53962707519531
25271/28840	Excuse me madame said Debray coldly I had your permission to do so and I have made use of	39.37395477294922
25272/28840	There are then 40000 francs for your share besides the 100000 you furnished me to begin with making in all 1340000 francs for your	577.69580078125
25273/28840	Now madame I took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and I was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my	209.9503173828125
25274/28840	There is your moneyhalf in banknotes the other half in checks payable to	3690.1337890625
25275/28840	Danglars will pay you the amount you may rest	85.26886749267578
25276/28840	Madame Danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank	167.2779083251953
25277/28840	This enormous fortune made no great appearance on the	347.89312744140625
25278/28840	Madame Danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the banknotes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocketbook and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of	393.94793701171875
25279/28840	Now madame said Debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about 60000 livres a year which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year at	110.11152648925781
25280/28840	You will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and I am ready to offer you all I possess on	121.02361297607422
25281/28840	Thank you sirthank you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the	103.68366241455078
25282/28840	Debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say As you please mad	103.31076049804688
25283/28840	Bah said Debray when she had left these are fine projects She will remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the B	397.8252868652344
25284/28840	Then taking up his account book he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid	261.7273254394531
25285/28840	I have 1060000 francs remaining he	1368.001953125
25286/28840	What a pity Mademoiselle de Villefort is dead She suited me in every respect and I would have married	57.05726623535156
25287/28840	And he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after Madame Danglars departure before he left the	112.9404296875
25288/28840	During this time he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his	209.45314025878906
25289/28840	Above the room in which Debray had been dividing two millions and a half with Madame Danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some	247.3984375
25290/28840	Mercédès and Albert were in that	40.236061096191406
25291/28840	It was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdens	811.279541015625
25292/28840	Albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual	1054.5484619140625
25293/28840	If he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly	334.10113525390625
25294/28840	50141m       Mercédès had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide	198.02183532714844
25295/28840	Amongst the Catalans Mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted	81.26826477050781
25296/28840	So long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new	642.2999877929688
25297/28840	And then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herselfof no one but	474.8978576660156
25298/28840	Upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live	166.1531219482422
25299/28840	Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained	671.8685302734375
25300/28840	Excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of	2791.651611328125
25301/28840	But the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the	381.66705322265625
25302/28840	Mother exclaimed Albert just as Madame Danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please I want capital to build my plans	142.86923217773438
25303/28840	Capitalnothing replied Mercédès with a mournful	18.728065490722656
25304/28840	And I have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3000 franc	673.0941162109375
25305/28840	Alas dear mother said the young man I have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of	103.7130355834961
25306/28840	These 3000 francs are enormous and I intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the	989.7197875976562
25307/28840	You say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these 3000 francs said Mercédès	132.19496154785156
25308/28840	I think so answered Albert in a firm	106.43468475341797
25309/28840	We will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the Allées de Meilhan at Marse	41.19740295410156
25310/28840	With 200 francs we can reach Marse	291.4815979003906
25311/28840	With 200 francsare you sure Albert   Oh as for that I have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are	617.4901123046875
25312/28840	You will take your place in the _coupé_ to Châl	24.000755310058594
25313/28840	You see mother I treat you handsomely for thirtyfive franc	859.6304931640625
25314/28840	Let us put down 120 added Albert	10262.6767578125
25315/28840	You see I am generous am I not mother   But you my poor child   I do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself A young man does not require luxuries besides I know what travelling	132.994140625
25316/28840	With a postchaise and valet de chambre   Any way	66.84671783447266
25317/28840	But these 200 francs   Here they are and 200 more	189.46884155273438
25318/28840	See I have sold my watch for 100 francs and the guard and seals for	548.8441772460938
25319/28840	How fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the	176.61253356933594
25320/28840	Still the same story of superfluities Now I think we are rich since instead of the 114 francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of	399.32427978515625
25321/28840	But we owe something in this house   Thirty francs but I pay that out of my 150 francsthat is understoodand as I require only eighty francs for my journey you see I am overwhelmed with	336.362060546875
25322/28840	But whence have you obtained them   Listen to me mother and do not yield too much to	191.39297485351562
25323/28840	And Albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at	475.025146484375
25324/28840	You cannot imagine mother how beautiful I think you said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial	180.6672821044922
25325/28840	You are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw   Dear child said Mercédès endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her	63.575538635253906
25326/28840	Indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to	336.9737243652344
25327/28840	I am not unhappy while I possess my son   Ah just so said Albert here begins the	147.26663208007812
25328/28840	Well mother I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the Spahis25 added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his selfabas	263.1029968261719
25329/28840	I thought my body was my own and that I might sell	126.4289779663086
25330/28840	I yesterday took the place of	185.44393920898438
25331/28840	I sold myself for more than I thought I was worth he added attempting to smile I fetched 2000 franc	320.8152770996094
25332/28840	Then these 1000 francs said Mercédès shudder	97.9201889038086
25333/28840	Are the half of the sum mother the other will be paid in a	112.12165832519531
25334/28840	Mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe and tears which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her emotion and ran down her	60.19630432128906
25335/28840	The price of his blood she murm	196.29754638671875
25336/28840	Yes if I am killed said Albert	92.58695220947266
25337/28840	But I assure you mother I have a strong intention of defending my person and I never felt half so strong an inclination to live as I do	190.87648010253906
25338/28840	Mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her	113.42615509033203
25339/28840	Well now you understand mother continued Albert here are more than 4000 francs settled on you upon these you can live at least two	355.07928466796875

25342/28840	What is life to meVery little without you mother for believe me but for you I should have ceased to live on the day I doubted my father and renounced his	229.7581024169922
25343/28840	Well I will live if you promise me still to hope and if you grant me the care of your future prospects you will redouble my	130.93869018554688
25344/28840	Then I will go to the governor of Algeria he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier I will tell him my gloomy	168.13284301757812
25345/28840	I will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months I shall be an officer or	94.13597106933594

25347/28840	If I am killedwell then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our misfortun	72.9430160522461
25348/28840	It is well replied Mercédès with her eloquent glance you are right my love let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of	74.20980072021484
25349/28840	But let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young man I assure you we are or rather we shall be very	63.55965805053711
25350/28840	You are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation I have become simple in my tastes and am without passion I	243.81875610351562

25355/28840	And so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of	989.7683715820312
25356/28840	We can now part come I shall engage your	762.0404663085938
25357/28840	And you my dear boy   I shall stay here for a few days longer we must accustom ourselves to	99.21134948730469
25358/28840	I want recommendations and some information relative to	5093.85107421875
25359/28840	I will join you again at Marse	79.21768951416016
25360/28840	Well be it solet us part said Mercédès folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cash	283.25970458984375
25361/28840	Albert gathered up his papers hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord and offering his arm to his mother they descended the	276.6557922363281
25362/28840	Someone was walking down before them and this person hearing the rustling of a silk dress turned	226.98876953125
25363/28840	You Morcerf replied the secretary resting on the	124.6465835571289
25364/28840	Curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his _incognito_ and he was	291.8328857421875
25365/28840	It was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in	72.09248352050781
25366/28840	Then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf   Pardon me he added with a smile I leave you	96.04267120361328
25367/28840	Mother he said turning towards Mercédès this is	25.4703426361084
25368/28840	Debray secretary of the Minister for the Interior once a friend of	211.53533935546875
25369/28840	How once stammered Debray what do you mean   I say so	26.925798416137695
25370/28840	Debray because I have no friends now and I ought not to have	55.69614028930664
25371/28840	I thank you for having recognized me	124.13021087646484
25372/28840	Debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interloc	431.65386962890625
25373/28840	Believe me dear Albert he said with all the emotion he was capable of feelingbelieve me I feel deeply for your misfortunes and if in any way I can serve you I am	125.4513168334961
25374/28840	In the midst of our misfortunes we are still rich enough not to require assistance from	88.21531677246094
25375/28840	We are leaving Paris and when our journey is paid we shall have 5000 francs	196.33546447753906
25376/28840	This parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few words of general civility and ran	853.1514892578125
25377/28840	That day the ministers clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his illhum	183.29830932617188
25378/28840	But that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house situated on the Boulevard de la Madeleine and an income of 50000 liv	62.59299850463867
25379/28840	The next day just as Debray was signing the deed that is about five oclock in the afternoon Madame de Morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the _coupé_ of the diligence which closed upon	71.02317810058594
25380/28840	A man was hidden in Lafittes bankinghouse behind one of the little arched windows which are placed above each desk he saw Mercédès enter the diligence and he also saw Albert	582.6279907226562
25381/28840	Then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with	84.31331634521484
25382/28840	The Lions Den   One division of La Force in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined is called the court of SaintBern	1437.1697998046875
25383/28840	The prisoners in their expressive language have named it the Lions Den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers	2700.533447265625
25384/28840	It is a prison within a prison the walls are double the thickness of the	1120.7723388671875
25385/28840	The gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and	1562.94140625
25386/28840	The courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls over which the sun glances obliquely when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical deform	2422.564453125

25388/28840	The court of SaintBernard has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests it is a long rectangle divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the	578.4485473632812
25389/28840	It is a wretched damp nay even horrible spot more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron	647.3465576171875
25390/28840	In the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the Den might be seen	190.66915893554688
25391/28840	Some of the inmates of the Lions Den were watching the operations of the prisoners toilet with considerable	314.1451416015625
25392/28840	See the prince is pluming himself said one of the	670.905517578125
25393/28840	Hes a fine looking fellow said another if he had only a comb and hairgrease hed take the shine off the gentlemen in white	3559.17578125
25394/28840	His coat looks nearly new and his boots are	1842.043701171875
25395/28840	It is pleasant to have such welldressed brethren and those gendarmes behaved shame	875.5475463867188
25396/28840	What jealousy to tear such clothes   He looks like a bigbug said another dresses in fine	2279.81640625
25397/28840	And then to be here so young Oh what larks   Meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was	408.2193298339844
25398/28840	Come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with	279.899169921875
25399/28840	Remember I have relations who possess more millions than you have den	636.3775024414062
25400/28840	Come said Andrea you are a man void of compassion Ill have you turned	198.9121856689453
25401/28840	This made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud	228.0431671142578
25402/28840	The prisoners then approached and formed a	596.4048461914062
25403/28840	I tell you that with that wretched sum continued Andrea I could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I am daily	251.66505432128906
25404/28840	The thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the	233.32997131347656
25405/28840	The latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate Andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long	636.4387817382812
25406/28840	The thieves had already approached Andrea some screaming _La savateLa savate_26 a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an ironheeled	4209.71826171875
25407/28840	Let us horsewhip the fine gentleman said	2103.269775390625
25408/28840	But Andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be	527.6831665039062
25409/28840	It was a Masonic sign Caderousse had taught	280.4228515625
25410/28840	He was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the ironheeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it	249.42300415039062
25411/28840	Some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of conscienceand the mob	152.4244384765625
25412/28840	The keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took Andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the Lions Den to something more substantial than mere	733.1806640625
25413/28840	Andrea made no resistance although he protested against	1306.8101806640625
25414/28840	Suddenly a voice was heard at the w	114.22984313964844
25415/28840	To the visitors room said the same	320.768310546875
25416/28840	You see someone pays me a	4148.70703125
25417/28840	Ah my dear sir you will see whether a Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person   And Andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in	157.44119262695312
25418/28840	Certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished Andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into La Force had maintained a rigid	838.3904418945312
25419/28840	An unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not	734.5005493164062
25420/28840	The hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when I shall think myself sinking into the	225.84446716308594
25421/28840	Why should I risk an imprudent step It might alienate my	511.57415771484375
25422/28840	He has two means of extricating me from this dilemmathe one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the other by buying off my judges with	3128.575927734375
25423/28840	I will say and do nothing until I am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and then   Andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably	106.175048828125
25424/28840	The unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the	323.16943359375
25425/28840	He had borne with the public prison and with privations of all sorts still by degrees nature or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and	688.3861694335938
25426/28840	It was at this moment of discomfort that the inspectors voice called him to the visiting	437.8274230957031
25427/28840	Andrea felt his heart leap with	1555.485595703125
25428/28840	It was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped	174.6063995361328
25429/28840	Behind the grating of the room into which Andrea had been led he saw while his eyes dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face of	82.91951751708984
25430/28840	Bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other gr	245.46299743652344
25431/28840	Good morning Benedetto said Bertuccio with his deep hollow	123.66679382324219
25432/28840	Youyou said the young man looking fearfully around	101.35313415527344
25433/28840	Do you not recognize me unhappy child   Silencebe silent said Andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls for Heavens sake do not speak so loud   You wish to speak with me alone do you not said Bertucc	83.17827606201172
25434/28840	And Bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the w	86.72223663330078
25435/28840	An order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to	84.4070816040039
25436/28840	Then he mentally addedStill my unknown protector I am not	2978.730224609375
25437/28840	They wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private	156.04443359375
25438/28840	I understand Bertuccio has been sent by my	48.65297317504883
25439/28840	The keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted Andrea to a room on the first	164.20314025878906
25440/28840	The room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous	560.94677734375
25441/28840	Bertuccio sat down upon the chair Andrea threw himself upon the bed the keeper	272.3421325683594
25442/28840	Now said the steward what have you to tell me   And you said	19.989164352416992
25443/28840	You must have much to tell me since you have come to seek	43.27486038208008

25446/28840	Well I should say If you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the	130.3583221435547
25447/28840	But there are some with which on the contrary I am not	63.17278289794922

25458/28840	Well   Well in the ChampsÉlysées there resides a very rich	87.12769317626953
25459/28840	At whose house you robbed and murdered did you not   I believe I	133.86476135253906
25460/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo   Tis you who have named him as	40.240360260009766
25461/28840	Well am I to rush into his arms and strain him to my heart crying My father my father like Monsieur Pixéré	1368.75439453125
25462/28840	27   Do not let us jest gravely replied Bertuccio and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced	108.26090240478516
25463/28840	Bah said Andrea a little overcome by the solemnity of Bertuccios manner why not   Because the person who bears it is too highly favored by Heaven to be the father of such a wretch as	110.51656341552734
25464/28840	And there will be fine doings if you do not take	124.38574981689453
25465/28840	I will say   Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself said Bertuccio in so calm a tone and with so steadfast a look that Andrea was moved to the very	123.33712005615234
25466/28840	Do you think you have to do with galleyslaves or novices in the world Benedetto you are fallen into terrible hands they are ready to open for youmake use of	152.42459106445312
25467/28840	Do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment but which they can take up again instantly if you attempt to intercept their	196.734130859375

25470/28840	Come who is my father   I came to tell	21.678346633911133
25471/28840	Ah cried Benedetto his eyes sparkling with	64.18352508544922
25472/28840	Just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to Bertuccio said   Excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the	69.13335418701172
25473/28840	And so closes our interview said Andrea to the worthy steward I wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil   I will return tomorrow said Bertucc	121.0187759399414
25474/28840	Good Gendarmes I am at your	52.61967849731445
25475/28840	Ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of   It shall be done replied Bertucc	74.11089324951172
25476/28840	Andrea extended his hand Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket and merely jingled a few pieces of	236.9427947998047
25477/28840	Thats what I mean said Andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of Bertucc	88.95121765136719
25478/28840	Can I be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad	701.8695678710938
25479/28840	Never mind we shall see Tomorrow then he added turning towards Bertucc	153.7666473388672
25480/28840	The Judge   We remember that the Abbé Busoni remained alone with Noirtier in the chamber of death and that the old man and the priest were the sole guardians of the young girls	49.63759231567383
25481/28840	de Villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the	32.49009704589844
25482/28840	The assizes also were about to begin and Villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of Cader	127.5092544555664
25483/28840	This affair like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in	54.86309051513672
25484/28840	The proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galleyslave on his deathbed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his	254.91114807128906
25485/28840	But the mind of the procureur was made up he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his selflove which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen	398.76007080078125
25486/28840	The case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of Villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming ass	211.24815368652344
25487/28840	He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of	422.828857421875
25488/28840	And then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor Valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his	343.52001953125
25489/28840	Once only had Villefort seen his father it was the day after that upon which Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto when the latter was to learn his fathers	78.72611236572266
25490/28840	The eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could scarcely	84.20836639404297
25491/28840	His glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that Villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was	191.79074096679688
25492/28840	Villefort became pale he understood the old mans	104.1072998046875
25493/28840	Madame de Villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her sons ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a	208.41036987304688
25494/28840	Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the	104.71194458007812
25495/28840	Villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the	231.82138061523438
25496/28840	As he approached it Noirtiers gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his	120.2499771118164
25497/28840	In that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible	345.91705322265625
25498/28840	Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten	83.23941040039062
25499/28840	It is well sir replied Villefort from belowit is well have patience but one day longer what I have said I will	101.16555786132812
25500/28840	Noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other	66.74742889404297
25501/28840	Villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his	115.39209747314453
25502/28840	The next day Monday was the first sitting of the ass	768.7599487304688
25503/28840	The morning dawned dull and gloomy and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red	509.7352600097656
25504/28840	The magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in	480.54644775390625
25505/28840	He opened the window a bright yellow streak crossed the sky and seemed to divide in half the poplars which stood out in black relief on the	301.5634765625
25506/28840	In the cloverfields beyond the chestnuttrees a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear morning	1192.3990478515625
25507/28840	The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort and refreshed his	318.1502380371094
25508/28840	Today he said with an efforttoday the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is	469.43316650390625
25509/28840	Involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtiers room where he had seen him the preceding	161.14129638671875
25510/28840	The curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old	120.04740142822266
25511/28840	His head dropped upon his chest and in this position he paced his study then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and	269.31903076171875
25512/28840	Villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of	435.32574462890625
25513/28840	What are you bringing me said	165.4385986328125
25514/28840	Who has paid me this attention   My mistress	330.5577087402344
25515/28840	She said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with	111.65934753417969
25516/28840	Villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one dra	148.0414581298828
25517/28840	It might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than	110.6653823852539
25518/28840	He then rose and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to	88.61190795898438
25519/28840	Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven oclock has just struck and that the trial commences at	142.1330108642578
25520/28840	Well said Villefort what then   Madame de Villefort is dressed she is quite ready and wishes to know if she is to accompany you sir   Where to   To the Pal	35.63099670410156
25521/28840	What to do   My mistress wishes much to be present at the	123.36023712158203
25522/28840	Ah said Villefort with a startling accent does she wish that   The servant drew back and said If you wish to go alone sir I will go and tell my	84.85114288330078
25523/28840	Villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his	149.7091064453125
25524/28840	Tell your mistress he at length answered that I wish to speak to her and I beg she will wait for me in her own	67.95491790771484
25525/28840	Then come to dress and shave	1919.3548583984375
25526/28840	The valet reappeared almost instantly and having shaved his master assisted him to dress entirely in	726.1676635742188
25527/28840	When he had finished he said   My mistress said she should expect you sir as soon as you had finished	112.1668930053711
25528/28840	And Villefort with his papers under his arm and hat in hand directed his steps toward the apartment of his	61.31692886352539
25529/28840	At the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale	195.27044677734375
25530/28840	Madame de Villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young Edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading	807.810791015625
25531/28840	She was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair and her gloves were on her	128.68032836914062
25532/28840	de Villefort remained mute and cold as a	65.11209106445312
25533/28840	Edward said Villefort fixing an imperious glance on the child go and play in the drawingroom my dear I wish to speak to your mam	58.295982360839844
25534/28840	Madame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange prelimin	167.57113647460938
25535/28840	Edward raised his head looked at his mother and then finding that she did not confirm the order began cutting off the heads of his leaden	196.0661163330078
25536/28840	de Villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear meGo   The child unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or	360.4961242675781
25537/28840	His father went up to him took him in his arms and kissed his	58.88465881347656
25538/28840	de Villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and	41.187896728515625
25539/28840	Madame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its	341.29864501953125
25540/28840	A hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly	310.8019104003906
25541/28840	Monsieur she said II do not understand	89.19309997558594
25542/28840	And in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cush	107.79436492919922
25543/28840	I asked you continued Villefort in a perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my fatherinlaw	85.2334976196289

25549/28840	You do not answer madame exclaimed the terrible interrog	154.18536376953125
25550/28840	Then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger It is true then you do not deny it She moved	159.9651336669922
25551/28840	And you cannot deny it added Villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of	76.60710144042969
25552/28840	You have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded	694.9609375
25553/28840	Since the death of Madame de SaintMéran I have known that a poisoner lived in my	32.25212478637695

25556/28840	Are you then a coward cried Villefort in a contemptuous	49.66304397583008

25633/28840	Well gentlemen the reason people die so multitudinously I like the word at	1889.6123046875
25634/28840	de Villeforts is that there is an assassin in the house   The two young men shuddered for the same idea had more than once occurred to	31.691022872924805
25635/28840	And who is the assassin they asked	301.3465881347656

25639/28840	It appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased	387.1128845214844
25640/28840	and Madame de SaintMéran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixirthree drops were sufficient then followed Barrois the old servant of	322.14447021484375

25643/28840	Yes it is an extraordinary story said Beauchamp is it not   It is absurd said Debr	21.833616256713867
25644/28840	Ah said Beauchamp you doubt me Well you can ask my servant or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow it was the talk of the	89.7115249633789
25645/28840	And this elixir where is it what is it   The child conceals	150.60813903808594
25646/28840	But where did he find it   In his mothers	327.6390686035156

25654/28840	But I do not see the Count of Monte Cristo	11.573514938354492

25656/28840	Still his sister did not seem uneasy and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days she was sure he was	69.74613952636719
25657/28840	Ah now I think of it the Count of Monte Cristo cannot appear in the hall said Beauch	26.876405715942383
25658/28840	Why not   Because he is an actor in the	251.7859344482422
25659/28840	Has he assassinated anyone then   No on the contrary they wished to assassinate	95.75860595703125

25661/28840	de Caderousse was murdered by his friend Benedet	41.89809036254883

25708/28840	President how entirely you have read my thoughts said Benedetto in his softest voice and most polite	172.2954864501953
25709/28840	This is indeed the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the	95.64497375488281
25710/28840	The public astonishment had reached its	507.3370361328125
25711/28840	There was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the	271.57867431640625
25712/28840	The audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous pre	3088.08935546875

25714/28840	A painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed	289.7471618652344
25715/28840	Repeat your fathers name said the	52.8331184387207

25720/28840	The explosion which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the	239.51675415039062
25721/28840	de Villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and	689.9945068359375
25722/28840	Order was reestablished in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one	316.9722900390625

25726/28840	They ask my name I cannot give it since my parents abandoned	358.0798034667969
25727/28840	But though I cannot give my own name not possessing one I can tell them my	133.65927124023438
25728/28840	Now I repeat my father is named	168.68316650390625
25729/28840	de Villefort and I am ready to prove	21.75484275817871
25730/28840	There was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the	197.52993774414062
25731/28840	All eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a	95.6655502319336
25732/28840	Gentlemen said Andrea commanding silence by his voice and manner I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have	543.1063232421875
25733/28840	But said the irritated president you called yourself Benedetto declared yourself an orphan and claimed Corsica as your	667.9662475585938
25734/28840	I said anything I pleased in order that the solemn declaration I have just made should not be withheld which otherwise would certainly have been the	535.969970703125
25735/28840	I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of the 27th of September 1817 and that I am the son of the procureur	57.58330535888672

25738/28840	A shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of	128.2789306640625
25739/28840	But how have you become acquainted with all these details asked the	55.01980972290039
25740/28840	A man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried	182.568115234375
25741/28840	He was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still	275.5068054199219
25742/28840	The man carried me to the foundling asylum where I was registered under the number	2917.553955078125

25744/28840	Thus you see though born in Paris I was brought up in Cors	146.9869842529297
25745/28840	There was a moments silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the still	122.43834686279297
25746/28840	Certainly I might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my	902.2073364257812
25747/28840	I increased in wickedness till I committed	6796.57373046875
25748/28840	After that I ceased to blaspheme but I cursed my	450.293701171875
25749/28840	That is why I have uttered the words for which you blame me that is why I have filled this whole assembly with	157.0372772216797

25752/28840	I did not even wish to know her name nor do I know	73.75570678710938
25753/28840	Just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hyster	209.78050231933594
25754/28840	She was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and Madame Danglars was	103.14311218261719
25755/28840	Notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears and the madness which turned his brain Villefort rose as he perceived	561.428466796875
25756/28840	The proofs the proofs said the president remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest	2287.98193359375
25757/28840	The proofs said Benedetto laughing do you want proofs  	100.8147964477539
25758/28840	de Villefort and then ask me for	96.20167541503906
25759/28840	Everyone turned towards the procureur who unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his	322.13079833984375
25760/28840	The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of aston	200.41261291503906
25761/28840	Father said Benedetto I am asked for proofs do you wish me to give them   No no it is useless stammered	52.35494613647461
25762/28840	de Villefort in a hoarse voice no it is useless   How useless cried the president what do you mean   I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes	92.897705078125
25763/28840	Gentlemen I know I am in the hands of an avenging God We need no proofs everything relating to this young man is	316.1229553222656
25764/28840	A dull gloomy silence like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature pervaded the assembly who shuddered in	830.282470703125
25765/28840	de Villefort cried the president do you yield to an hallucination What are you no longer in possession of your senses This strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your	267.9742431640625
25766/28840	The procureur dropped his head his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly	199.74774169921875
25767/28840	I am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may	188.7103729248047
25768/28840	I acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed	141.53648376464844
25769/28840	And as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a door	99.10387420654297
25770/28840	The whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian	144.06167602539062
25771/28840	Well said Beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural   _Ma foi_ said ChâteauRenaud I would rather end my career like	48.078880310058594
25772/28840	de Morcerf a pistolshot seems quite delightful compared with this	523.7382202148438
25773/28840	And to think that I had an idea of marrying his daughter said Debr	40.32658004760742
25774/28840	She did well to die poor girl   The sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another	735.1680908203125
25775/28840	As for Andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some	166.8141632080078
25776/28840	Well what do you think of this my fine fellow asked Debray of the sergeantatarms slipping a louis into his	86.78984069824219
25777/28840	There will be extenuating circumstances he	1034.0421142578125
25778/28840	Expiation   Notwithstanding the density of the crowd	1611.56201171875
25779/28840	de Villefort saw it open before	66.03167724609375
25780/28840	There is something so aweinspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great	498.0621032714844
25781/28840	Many people have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during	1068.883544921875
25782/28840	Thus Villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the Palais and	68.17203521728516
25783/28840	Though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his	317.14794921875
25784/28840	There are some situations which men understand by instinct but which reason is powerless to explain in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of	706.0164184570312
25785/28840	Those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as	461.1257629394531
25786/28840	It would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which Villefort left the Pal	43.0908317565918
25787/28840	Every pulse beat with feverish excitement every nerve was strained every vein swollen and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest thus multiplying his agony a thousand	1033.3638916015625

25789/28840	Having staggered as far as the Rue Dauphine he perceived his carriage awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself threw himself on the cushions and pointed towards the Faubourg SaintHonoré the carriage drove	62.46708297729492
25790/28840	All the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already	498.6797790527344
25791/28840	God he murmured not knowing what he saidGodGod Behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of	404.6603088378906
25792/28840	Villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against	619.2509765625
25793/28840	He put out his hand to remove the object it was a fan which Madame de Villefort had left in the carriage this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like	132.9681396484375
25794/28840	50189m       Oh he exclaimed as though a redhot iron were piercing his	227.98684692382812
25795/28840	During the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind now another object not less terrible suddenly presented	372.57586669921875
25796/28840	We will flee from Paris and go as far as the earth	440.049560546875
25797/28840	And Villefort dashed open the window in front of the	76.61919403076172
25798/28840	Faster faster he cried in a tone which electrified the coach	776.3999633789062
25799/28840	The horses impelled by fear flew towards the	1270.65087890625
25800/28840	Yes yes repeated Villefort as he approached his homeyes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my	365.59320068359375
25801/28840	She loves him it was for his sake she has committed these	162.24554443359375
25802/28840	We ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her	216.20518493652344
25803/28840	She will repent and no one will know that she has been	131.930419921875
25804/28840	The events which have taken place in my house though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then I will add them to my list of	316.2524719238281
25805/28840	What will it signify if one two or three more are added My wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with	382.967041015625
25806/28840	I shall have performed a good action and my heart will be	198.48817443847656
25807/28840	And the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some	97.13578796386719
25808/28840	50191m       The carriage stopped at the door of the	13.949478149414062
25809/28840	Villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return he could read no other expression on their	114.34892272949219
25810/28840	Neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing	205.69863891601562
25811/28840	Noirtiers room he perceived two figures through the halfopen door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on	318.4562072753906
25812/28840	Come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wifes room nothing is changed	161.96649169921875
25813/28840	He then closed the door of the	49.05344772338867
25814/28840	No one must disturb us he said I must speak freely to her accuse myself and sayhe approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his	462.9689636230469
25815/28840	Not locked he cried that is	306.24420166015625
25816/28840	And he entered the little room in which Edward slept for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at	148.35174560546875
25817/28840	With a single glance Villeforts eye ran through the	165.96095275878906
25818/28840	Not here he said doubtless she is in her	208.09835815429688
25819/28840	He rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shudder	335.635009765625
25820/28840	He fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being	68.96769714355469
25821/28840	Who is there answered the voice of her he	169.67913818359375
25822/28840	He thought that voice more feeble than	526.477783203125
25823/28840	But notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained	173.0004425048828
25824/28840	Villefort burst it open with a violent	207.96224975585938
25825/28840	At the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir Madame de Villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring	129.28651428222656
25826/28840	Héloïse Héloïse he said what is the matter Speak The young woman extended her stiff white hands towards	204.029296875
25827/28840	It is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her	74.25411987304688
25828/28840	What more do you want and she fell full length on the	175.1855010986328
25829/28840	Villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden sto	198.64138793945312
25830/28840	Villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the	476.0005798339844
25831/28840	My son he exclaimed suddenly where is my sonEdward Edward and he rushed out of the room still crying Edward Edward The name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran	347.8123474121094

25835/28840	A cold perspiration burst out on Villeforts brow his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered	193.34347534179688
25836/28840	In Madame de Villeforts room he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the	79.6827163696289
25837/28840	To enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate	177.99365234375
25838/28840	To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre to speak seemed like violating the silence of the	312.12640380859375
25839/28840	His tongue was paralyzed in his	224.90338134765625

25862/28840	Villefort perceiving the abbé passed his hand across his	17.399919509887695
25863/28840	The past came to him like one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the	1917.703369140625
25864/28840	He recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at Auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of Valentines	56.17921447753906
25865/28840	I came to pray over the body of your	142.5965118408203

25867/28840	It is the face of the Count of Monte Cristo exclaimed the procureur with a haggard	28.24344825744629
25868/28840	That voice that voicewhere did I first hear it   You heard it for the first time at Marseilles twentythree years ago the day of your marriage with Mademoiselle de SaintMé	52.16134262084961

25872/28840	This lasted several minutes until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the	256.0198059082031

25875/28840	In his arms he held the child whom no skill had been able to recall to	184.74615478515625
25876/28840	Bending on one knee he placed it reverently by the side of its mother with its head upon her	325.82806396484375
25877/28840	Then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked   Where is	83.77806091308594
25878/28840	de Villefort   The servant instead of answering pointed to the	43.543277740478516
25879/28840	Monte Cristo ran down the steps and advancing towards the spot designated beheld Villefort encircled by his servants with a spade in his hand and digging the earth with	160.10165405273438
25880/28840	It is not here   50197m       And then he moved farther on and began again to	119.45957946777344
25881/28840	Monte Cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble   Sir you have indeed lost a son but   Villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor	85.03250885009766

25883/28840	Oh he said he is mad And as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had	95.26527404785156

25886/28840	Prepare yourself Maximilian he said with a smile we leave Paris	123.12035369873047
25887/28840	Have you nothing more to do there asked Mor	56.12408447265625
25888/28840	No replied Monte Cristo God grant I may not have done too much	137.8514404296875

25894/28840	What dreadful sufferings said Julie remembering Valentine but whom with a delicacy natural to women she did not name before her	579.1051025390625
25895/28840	If the Supreme Being has directed the fatal blow said Emmanuel it must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past lives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful	725.761962890625
25896/28840	Do you not form a very rash judgment Emmanuel said	1451.251953125

25899/28840	Emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard the wellknown signal given by the porter that a visitor had	84.14956665039062
25900/28840	Nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the Count of Monte Cristo appeared on the	11.620546340942383
25901/28840	The young people uttered a cry of joy while Maximilian raised his head but let it fall again	59.15454864501953

25903/28840	To seek me repeated Morrel as if awakening from a	510.77392578125
25904/28840	Yes said Monte Cristo has it not been agreed that I should take you with me and did I not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure   I am ready said Maximilian I came expressly to wish them	54.68107986450195
25905/28840	Whither are you going count asked	423.7086486816406
25906/28840	In the first instance to Marseilles mad	84.00523376464844

25908/28840	said Julie will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy Morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his count	172.46340942382812
25909/28840	You perceive then that he is not happy said the	100.67687225341797
25910/28840	Yes replied the young woman and fear much that he finds our home but a dull	288.9961242675781

25913/28840	I have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said Morrel in his tranquil but mournful	287.8481750488281
25914/28840	Good said Monte Cristo smiling in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a welldisciplined	1244.200439453125
25915/28840	And you leave us said Julie at a moments warning you do not give us a dayno not even an hour before your departure   My carriage is at the door madame and I must be in Rome in five	109.80904388427734
25916/28840	But does Maximilian go to Rome exclaimed	264.4195556640625
25917/28840	I am going wherever it may please the count to take me said Morrel with a smile full of grief I am under his orders for the next	75.52580261230469
25918/28840	Oh heavens how strangely he expresses himself count said	2951.936767578125
25919/28840	Maximilian goes with _me_ said the count in his kindest and most persuasive manner therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brothers	228.5714874267578
25920/28840	Once more farewell my dear sister Emmanuel adieu Morrel	372.39984130859375
25921/28840	His carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart said	573.9202270507812
25922/28840	Oh Maximilian Maximilian you are certainly concealing something from	71.45413970947266
25923/28840	Pshaw said Monte Cristo you will see him return to you gay smiling and	130.89747619628906
25924/28840	Maximilian cast a look of disdain almost of anger on the	169.10533142089844
25925/28840	We must leave you said Monte Crist	27.578943252563477
25926/28840	Like benefactors in romances I should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because I am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellowcreat	260.0221252441406
25927/28840	On the eve of departure I carry my egotism so far as to say Do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me	234.49542236328125
25928/28840	Never see you again exclaimed Emmanuel while two large tears rolled down Julies cheeks never behold you again It is not a man then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do	241.297607421875

25930/28840	Fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome	296.75006103515625
25931/28840	No Emmanuel I am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrileg	494.4058532714844
25932/28840	Restore my brother to peace and happiness whispered Julie to Monte Crist	522.7434692382812
25933/28840	And the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to Morrels	147.72686767578125
25934/28840	You still confide then in Sinbad the Sailor asked he	228.3205108642578

25940/28840	Maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a	84.33378601074219
25941/28840	Half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly the count had just pulled the silken checkstring which was fastened to Alis	271.3674011230469
25942/28840	The Nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage	183.7906951904297
25943/28840	The count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short	78.36981201171875
25944/28840	With folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great	392.7967834472656

25946/28840	God only knows that I retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless	470.5028076171875

25949/28840	Ten leagues were passed and not a single word was	161.7877197265625
25950/28840	Morrel was dreaming and Monte Cristo was looking at the dream	139.35240173339844
25951/28840	Morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me   No count but to leave Paris   If I thought happiness might await you in Paris Morrel I would have left you	112.58937072753906

25953/28840	Maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by	89.09163665771484
25954/28840	I have two friends who in this way never depart from me the one who gave me being and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on	219.92449951171875
25955/28840	I consult them when doubtful and if I ever do any good it is due to their beneficent counsel	643.885986328125
25956/28840	Listen to the voice of your heart Morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards	211.9607391357422
25957/28840	My friend said Maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but	107.03254699707031

25966/28840	Morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected	273.4981384277344

25974/28840	Monte Cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by Morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the	93.84152221679688

25977/28840	50209m       The count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the	35.822357177734375
25978/28840	Turning to his friend   Dear Maximilian said the count have you nothing to do in this land   I have to weep over the grave of my father replied Morrel in a broken	47.09855270385742

25982/28840	Monte Cristo remained on the same spot until Maximilian was out of sight he then walked slowly towards the Allées de Meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this	78.90650939941406

26004/28840	The count looked up and fixed his eyes on Mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards	80.21888732910156
26005/28840	Years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the	785.4691772460938

26008/28840	I once possessed piety innocence and love the three ingredients of the happiness of angels and now what am I   Monte Cristo approached her and silently took her	265.83319091796875

26016/28840	50213m       Mercédès burst into tears her womans heart was breaking under its load of	72.47185516357422
26017/28840	Monte Cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a	296.41278076171875
26018/28840	It often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole	994.0350952148438

26022/28840	I take that God to witness at whose feet I have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years that I would have sacrificed my life to you and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with	425.1938171386719

26026/28840	Not a thought was given to a life which you once Mercédès had the power to render blissful not one hour of peaceful calm was mine but I felt myself driven on like an exterminating	331.3210144042969

26034/28840	I live as it were between two	614.7733764648438

26037/28840	The other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of Edmond Dantè	53.308876037597656
26038/28840	I approve of the deed but I must pray for the	129.0498809814453
26039/28840	Your son shall be happy Mercédès repeated the	35.56368637084961
26040/28840	Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly	359.4593505859375
26041/28840	But what are your intentions   Mercédès smiled	20.895938873291016
26042/28840	To say that I shall live here like the Mercédès of other times gaining my bread by labor would not be true nor would you believe	174.76266479492188
26043/28840	I have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in	139.02102661132812
26044/28840	However I shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which I found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain	121.49149322509766
26045/28840	Rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of livingthat will signify but little that concerns God you and	1316.1630859375
26046/28840	Mercédès said the count I do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by	150.62960815429688
26047/28840	de Morcerf half of it at least by right belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and	302.94580078125
26048/28840	I perceive what you are intending to propose to me but I cannot accept it Edmondmy son would not permit	127.72265625
26049/28840	Nothing shall be done without the full approbation of Albert de Morcer	69.02735137939453
26050/28840	I will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to	106.13536834716797

26052/28840	I have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that I am become passive in the hands of the Almighty like a sparrow in the talons of an	286.8205871582031
26053/28840	I live because it is not ordained for me to	151.31985473632812
26054/28840	If succor be sent to me I will accept	105.17221069335938
26055/28840	Ah madame said Monte Cristo you should not talk thus It is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven on the contrary we are all free	116.69052124023438
26056/28840	Alas exclaimed Mercédès if it were so if I possessed freewill but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to	258.31732177734375
26057/28840	Monte Cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her	131.1917266845703
26058/28840	Will you not even say you will see me again he	67.82296752929688
26059/28840	On the contrary we shall meet again said Mercédès pointing to heaven with solemn	46.578224182128906
26060/28840	I tell you so to prove to you that I still	78.11915588378906
26061/28840	And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count Mercédès rushed up the stairs and	71.91450500488281
26062/28840	Monte Cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the qu	183.48597717285156
26063/28840	But Mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old Dantè	34.829654693603516
26064/28840	The Past   The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Mercédès probably never to behold her	85.10787963867188
26065/28840	Since the death of little Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Crist	97.76827239990234
26066/28840	Having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before	388.1250305175781
26067/28840	More than this the conversation which had just taken place between Mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with	67.0683822631836
26068/28840	A man of the counts temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior	1045.0838623046875
26069/28840	He thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame	181.5919647216797
26070/28840	I cannot have deceived myself he said I must look upon the past in a false	83.20960998535156
26071/28840	The reason why I am now dissatisfied is that I have not a clear appreciation of the	312.1439514160156
26072/28840	The past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we	899.1966552734375
26073/28840	My position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he cannot recollect when he received	165.20030212402344
26074/28840	Come then thou regenerate man thou extravagant prodigal thou awakened sleeper thou allpowerful visionary thou invincible millionaireonce again review thy past life of starvation and wretchedness revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted and where despair received	9941.474609375
26075/28840	Too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which Monte Cristo seeks to behold Dantè	145.1301727294922
26076/28840	Hide thy diamonds bury thy gold shroud thy splendor exchange riches for poverty liberty for a prison a living body for a corpse   As he thus reasoned Monte Cristo walked down the Rue de la Caiss	1284.5994873046875
26077/28840	It was the same through which twentyfour years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and	186.33485412597656
26078/28840	And yet they were the same murmured Monte Cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so	244.00148010253906
26079/28840	He proceeded towards the quay by the Rue SaintLaurent and advanced to the Consigne it was the point where he had	302.4085998535156
26080/28840	A pleasureboat with striped awning was going	5370.900390625
26081/28840	Monte Cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good	303.4299621582031
26082/28840	The weather was magnificent and the excursion a	495.96710205078125
26083/28840	The sun red and flaming was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming	2860.06884765625
26084/28840	Like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantè	803.625732421875
26085/28840	Clear sky swiftflitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the Château dIf seemed like the phantom of a mortal	347.5523986816406
26086/28840	As they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice   Sir we are at the	103.29824829101562
26087/28840	Monte Cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayon	249.95150756835938
26088/28840	The journey had seemed very long to Dantès but Monte Cristo found it equally	99.97091674804688
26089/28840	Each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the	347.0926208496094
26090/28840	50219m       There had been no prisoners confined in the Château dIf since the revolution of July it was only inhabited by a guard kept there for the prevention of	137.3785858154297
26091/28840	A concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of	333.7331848144531
26092/28840	The count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other	337.7839050292969
26093/28840	The concierge who attended him had only been there since	811.70751953125
26094/28840	He again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow	390.4982604980469
26095/28840	His eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the Abbé Faria had	131.6075897216797
26096/28840	Monte Cristo felt his limbs tremble he seated himself upon a log of	279.77947998046875
26097/28840	Monte Cristo shuddered Antoine had been his jail	204.37339782714844
26098/28840	The count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concier	96.8672866821289
26099/28840	Would you like to hear the story sir   Yes relate it said Monte Cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own	106.98712921142578
26100/28840	This dungeon said the concierge was it appears some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner the more so since he was full of	145.30799865722656
26101/28840	Another person was confined in the Château at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad	74.75607299804688
26102/28840	Ah indeedmad repeated Monte Cristo and what was his mania   He offered millions to anyone who would set him at	276.4711608886719
26103/28840	Monte Cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens there was a stone veil between him and the firm	87.71952056884766
26104/28840	He thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria offered the	186.78799438476562
26105/28840	Could the prisoners see each other he	149.68319702148438
26106/28840	Oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the	297.6923828125
26107/28840	And which of them made this passage   Oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbé was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an	160.43280029296875
26108/28840	However be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his	233.94204711914062
26109/28840	Do you see it and the man held the torch to the	98.57455444335938
26110/28840	50223m       Ah yes I see said the count in a voice hoarse from	35.3045654296875
26111/28840	The result was that the two men communicated with one another how long they did so nobody	398.776611328125
26112/28840	One day the old man fell ill and	258.34442138671875
26113/28840	Now guess what the young one did   Tell	291.4621276855469
26114/28840	He carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead	123.3409423828125
26115/28840	Did you ever hear of such an idea   Monte Cristo closed his eyes and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his	138.1922149658203
26116/28840	The jailer continued   Now this was his	228.8988037109375
26117/28840	They never buried the dead they merely attached a heavy cannonball to the feet and then threw them into the	238.79238891601562
26118/28840	The count breathed with difficulty the cold drops ran down his forehead and his heart was full of	255.61004638671875
26119/28840	No he muttered the doubt I felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness but here the wound reopens and the heart again thirsts for	1057.0540771484375
26120/28840	And the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards   Oh no of course	259.5182189941406
26121/28840	_Ma foi_ yes though he was in his own	132.28512573242188
26122/28840	What do you mean   The report was that he had been a naval officer who had been confined for plotting with the Bonapart	69.61656188964844
26123/28840	Then the count added aloud Was his name ever known   Oh yes but only as	300.53192138671875
26124/28840	Oh Villefort Villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours   Do you wish to see anything more sir said the concier	77.19730377197266
26125/28840	Yes especially if you will show me the poor abbés	46.647003173828125
26126/28840	repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his	114.98970031738281
26127/28840	Wait said Monte Cristo I wish to take one final glance around this	75.38055419921875
26128/28840	This is fortunate said the guide I have forgotten the other	220.30319213867188
26129/28840	I will leave you the torch	255.96449279785156
26130/28840	No take it away I can see in the	98.31623077392578
26131/28840	They said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his	77.19181823730469
26132/28840	He spent fourteen years to arrive at that muttered the	354.1611022949219
26133/28840	Scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by	409.13250732421875
26134/28840	Then he looked around him and really recognized his	110.30465698242188
26135/28840	Yes he said there is the stone upon which I used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day I dashed my head against the	149.04946899414062
26136/28840	Oh those figures how well I remember them I made them one day to calculate the age of my father that I might know whether I should find him still living and that of Mercédès to know if I should find her still	89.04573059082031
26137/28840	After finishing that calculation I had a minutes	1895.416748046875
26138/28840	I did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity and a bitter laugh escaped the	429.86871337890625
26139/28840	He saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of Mercédè	67.93891143798828
26140/28840	Oh God thou hast preserved my memory I thank thee I thank thee   At this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall the guide was coming Monte Cristo went to meet	122.41879272460938
26141/28840	Follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another	325.52740478515625
26142/28840	There again Monte Cristo was assailed by a multitude of	73.87467193603516
26143/28840	The first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had	94.20457458496094
26144/28840	The sight of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment and tears fell from his	173.46913146972656
26145/28840	This is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained un	150.8018798828125

26159/28840	I do not knowI only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners	461.5325012207031
26160/28840	And have you them yet   No sir I sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but I have still something	240.7410125732422
26161/28840	What is it asked the count impatient	54.02561569213867

26170/28840	Ah he exclaimed here is my	277.62432861328125

26219/28840	He was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting	492.7863464355469
26220/28840	This man was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the Legion of Honor still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under	437.52813720703125
26221/28840	He might be recognized not only by these signs but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion as a	102.5423355102539
26222/28840	Another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other Italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of Figaro served all possible linguistic	1222.8367919921875
26223/28840	_Allegro_ he called out to the postilions at every	1332.9837646484375

26226/28840	The traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house of Thomson  French which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in	70.10474395751953
26227/28840	It was situated in the Via dei Banchi near	1407.3779296875

26229/28840	Now as these street Arabs of Rome more fortunate than those of Paris understand every language more especially the French they heard the traveller order an apartment a dinner and finally inquire the way to the house of Thomson 	330.6315002441406
26230/28840	The Frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of Thomson  French that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road or to wait for him at the bankers	71.16915130615234
26231/28840	He reached it before the carriage	508.1980285644531

26237/28840	The man who had followed Danglars sat down on a	28.025495529174805
26238/28840	The clerk continued to write for the next five minutes the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motion	237.1591339111328
26239/28840	Then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper he raised his head and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy   Ah ha he said here you are Peppino   Yes was the laconic	107.9492416381836
26240/28840	You have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman   There is no great merit due to me for we were informed of	135.6943817138672

26242/28840	Very well only do not give me false information as you did the other	137.48854064941406
26243/28840	What do you meanof whom do you speak Was it the Englishman who carried off 3000 crowns from here the other day   50237m       No he really had 3000 crowns and we found	277.81475830078125

26245/28840	In that case he must either have paid his debts   A Russian do that   Or spent the money   Possibly after	253.02572631835938
26246/28840	But you must let me make my observations or the Frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the	538.5939331054688
26247/28840	Peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which Danglars and the attendant had gone	271.86865234375
26248/28840	At the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming count	296.4333801269531

26254/28840	According to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the	80.28520202636719
26255/28840	Guides are useful people who will turn their hands to	612.8439331054688
26256/28840	Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of	25.089149475097656
26257/28840	The _cicerone_ reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coach	52.75721740722656
26258/28840	Will your excellency visit Saint Peters asked the _cicerone	47.37442398071289
26259/28840	I did not come to Rome to see said Danglars aloud then he added softly with an avaricious smile I came to touch and he rapped his pocketbook in which he had just placed a	64.7720718383789
26260/28840	Then your excellency is going   To the	19.989240646362305
26261/28840	Casa Pastrini said the _cicerone_ to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly	42.943389892578125
26262/28840	Danglars was tired and sleepy he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his	245.25637817382812
26263/28840	Peppino had a little spare time so he had a game of _morra_ with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of Orviet	637.6581420898438
26264/28840	The next morning Danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at	131.81842041015625
26265/28840	He breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the Eternal City ordered posthorses at	1125.1240234375
26266/28840	But Danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting	195.8169403076172
26267/28840	The horses only arrived at two oclock and the _cicerone_ did not bring the passport till	72.75616455078125

26270/28840	As Danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your high	182.53164672851562
26271/28840	Which road asked the postilion in	270.1732482910156
26272/28840	Signor Pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped	149.01414489746094
26273/28840	Danglars intended travelling to Venice where he would receive one part of his fortune and then proceeding to Vienna where he would find the rest he meant to take up his residence in the latter town which he had been told was a city of	159.59584045410156
26274/28840	He had scarcely advanced three leagues out of Rome when daylight began to	324.38836669921875
26275/28840	Danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next	115.84390258789062
26276/28840	_Non capisco_ do not understand was the	4178.48779296875

26278/28840	I will stop at the first postinghouse said Danglars to	202.79698181152344
26279/28840	He still felt the same selfsatisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nights	154.8688507080078
26280/28840	He was luxuriously stretched in a good English calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven	623.0650024414062
26281/28840	But the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was _Non capisco	370.7803649902344
26282/28840	50241m       Danglars therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting	87.46282958984375
26283/28840	Danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his	188.5677947998047
26284/28840	He intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the	557.5869140625
26285/28840	Danglars astonished opened the door but a strong hand pushed him back and the carriage rolled	96.90258026123047
26286/28840	Eh he said to the postilion eh _mio caro_   This was another little piece of Italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing Italian duets with Cavalc	326.9756164550781

26297/28840	And he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to	82.94831085205078
26298/28840	He then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the	312.7130432128906
26299/28840	He understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to	227.8895721435547
26300/28840	Oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my	453.39990234375
26301/28840	The carriage continued to roll on with frightful	369.4944152832031
26302/28840	An hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road	384.3314208984375
26303/28840	At length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and Danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling	83.9541015625
26304/28840	He remembered those interesting stories so little believed in Paris respecting Roman bandits he remembered the adventures that Albert de Morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry Mademoiselle Eugé	103.481689453125
26305/28840	Just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel	17477.4921875
26306/28840	On the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular	515.6725463867188
26307/28840	On a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it	87.23516082763672
26308/28840	At the same time the door was	22.369104385375977
26309/28840	Danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak Italian he understood it very	150.0953826904297
26310/28840	More dead than alive he looked around	227.32151794433594
26311/28840	Four men surrounded him besides the post	373.4358215332031
26312/28840	_Di quà_ said one of the men descending a little path leading out of the Appian	1007.7239990234375
26313/28840	Danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following	88.76482391357422
26314/28840	Still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentin	349.0296630859375
26315/28840	After walking for about ten minutes during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the	117.38426971435547
26316/28840	He wished to speak but his tongue refused to	172.98353576660156
26317/28840	_Avanti_ said the same sharp and imperative	1604.3394775390625
26318/28840	This time Danglars had double reason to understand for if the word and gesture had not explained the speakers meaning it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the	211.30075073242188
26319/28840	This guide was our friend Peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open	792.6782836914062
26320/28840	Peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy	558.0313720703125
26321/28840	The voice and gesture of the man who followed Danglars ordered him to do the	47.882957458496094
26322/28840	There was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of Roman banditt	97.34425354003906
26323/28840	Danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by	382.92413330078125
26324/28840	Notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the Campagna he slid down like Peppino and closing his eyes fell upon his	445.43463134765625
26325/28840	As he touched the ground he opened his	37.95653533935547
26326/28840	50245m       The path was wide but	67.15287017822266
26327/28840	Peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a	405.6827392578125
26328/28840	Two other men descended after Danglars forming the rearguard and pushing Danglars whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two	490.73333740234375
26329/28840	The walls were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the	291.203857421875
26330/28840	A sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left	179.81703186035156
26331/28840	A friend a friend said Peppino but where is the captain   There said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the rock the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched	170.57228088378906
26332/28840	Fine spoil captain fine spoil said Peppino in Italian and taking Danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling	166.1875
26333/28840	Is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading Plutarchs _Life of Alexander	779.6848754882812
26334/28840	At this rather impertinent order Peppino raised his torch to the face of Danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes	132.19906616210938
26335/28840	His agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous	984.9628295898438
26336/28840	The man is tired said the captain conduct him to his	168.78012084960938
26337/28840	Oh murmured Danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep I shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards I see glistening in the	97.72189331054688
26338/28840	The banker uttered a groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor	335.9791259765625
26339/28840	He no longer possessed strength will power or feeling he followed where they led	658.5238647460938
26340/28840	At length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six	82.87915802001953
26341/28840	Then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the	92.33590698242188
26342/28840	The cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the	3052.5634765625
26343/28840	A bed of dried grass covered with goatskins was placed in one	1324.51904296875
26344/28840	Danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of	656.4727783203125
26345/28840	Oh God be praised he said it is a real bed   This was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of	129.72303771972656
26346/28840	He had not done so for ten years	71.93321990966797
26347/28840	_Ecco_ said the guide and pushing Danglars into the cell he closed the door upon	177.0289764404297
26348/28840	A bolt grated and Danglars was a	78.04131317138672
26349/28840	If there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of	60.41778564453125
26350/28840	Sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous Luigi V	910.1080932617188
26351/28840	These recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by Danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquill	84.36579895019531
26352/28840	Since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at	67.64029693603516
26353/28840	They had arrested him for the purpose of robbery and as he had only a few louis about him he doubted not he would be rans	230.06089782714844
26354/28840	He remembered that Morcerf had been taxed at 4000 crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than Morcerf he fixed his own price at 8000 crown	417.00836181640625
26355/28840	Eight thousand crowns amounted to 48000 livres he would then have about 5050000 francs	673.755615234375
26356/28840	With this sum he could manage to keep out of	290.4461364746094
26357/28840	Luigi Vampas Bill of Fare   We awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by Dangl	1126.062744140625
26358/28840	But in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into	701.6691284179688
26359/28840	Yes yes he murmured I am in the hands of the brigands of whom Albert de Morcerf	31.117656707763672
26360/28840	His first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was	150.6322784423828
26361/28840	He borrowed this from _Don Quixote_ the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly	1577.784912109375
26362/28840	No he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his hands into his	151.3009490966797
26363/28840	They were untouched the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from Rome to Venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little notecase containing his letter of credit for 5050000 franc	472.5461730957031
26364/28840	Singular bandits he exclaimed they have left me my purse and pocket	437.77166748046875
26365/28840	As I was saying last night they intend me to be rans	1089.10986328125
26366/28840	Hello here is my watch Let me see what time it	104.11563110351562
26367/28840	Danglars watch one of Breguets repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous night struck half past	1202.160888671875
26368/28840	Without this Danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his	57.68644714355469
26369/28840	Should he demand an explanation from the bandits or should he wait patiently for them to propose it The last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve o	448.0646667480469
26370/28840	During all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his	69.14643859863281
26371/28840	50249m       Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over	48.96812438964844
26372/28840	Faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his	537.583984375
26373/28840	At twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and Danglars wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door	219.5670928955078
26374/28840	He was an athletic gigantic bandit with large eyes thick lips and a flat nose his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his	3480.496337890625
26375/28840	But the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting	1941.0982666015625
26376/28840	He got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his	58.78461456298828
26377/28840	Danglars knew that he was heard so he redoubled his	44.748504638671875
26378/28840	Danglars feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goatskin and did not breathe another	282.6266784667969
26379/28840	Four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another band	278.39361572265625
26380/28840	Danglars who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his eye to the crack of the door and recognized the intelligent countenance of his	270.0471496582031
26381/28840	It was indeed Peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chickpeas stewed with	982.1788330078125
26382/28840	Near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of Villetri grapes and a flask of Orviet	2322.556640625
26383/28840	Danglars watched these preparations and his mouth	78.30884552001953
26384/28840	Come he said to himself let me try if he will be more tractable than the other and he tapped gently at the	103.4078598022461
26385/28840	_On y va_ coming exclaimed Peppino who from frequenting the house of Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its idi	1009.3831787109375
26386/28840	Then he added aloud Yes sir I am hungryvery	402.5469970703125
26387/28840	And your excellency wants something to eat   At once if possible   Nothing easier said Pepp	87.30569458007812
26388/28840	Here you can get anything you want by paying for it of course as among honest	749.0879516601562
26389/28840	Although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed	538.232421875
26390/28840	That is not the custom excellency said Pepp	37.35963821411133
26391/28840	A bad reason replied Danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper but I am	325.9657287597656
26392/28840	Let me have some dinner   At once What would your excellency like   And Peppino placed his pan on the ground so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of Dangl	84.13587951660156
26393/28840	Have you kitchens here   Kitchensof coursecomplete	34949.734375
26394/28840	And cooks   Excellent   Well a fowl fish gameit signifies little so that I	540.4279174804688
26395/28840	You mentioned a fowl I think   Yes a f	98.78045654296875
26396/28840	Peppino turning around shouted A fowl for his excellency His voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and halfnaked young man appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head without the assistance of his	353.3863220214844
26397/28840	I could almost believe myself at the Café de Paris murmured Dangl	57.128135681152344
26398/28840	Here your excellency said Peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the wormeaten table which with the stool and the goatskin bed formed the entire furniture of the	143.58456420898438
26399/28840	Danglars asked for a knife and	123.81304931640625
26400/28840	Here excellency said Peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood	390.50457763671875
26401/28840	Danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the f	62.840675354003906
26402/28840	Pardon me excellency said Peppino placing his hand on the bankers shoulder people pay here before they	183.29550170898438
26403/28840	They might not be satisfied and   Ah ha thought Danglars this is not so much like Paris except that I shall probably be skinned Never mind Ill fix that all	173.25900268554688
26404/28840	I have always heard how cheap poultry is in Italy I should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at	545.3182983398438
26405/28840	There he said throwing a louis	330.360107421875
26406/28840	Peppino picked up the louis and Danglars again prepared to carve the f	92.00750732421875
26407/28840	Stay a moment your excellency said Peppino rising you still owe me	48.26606750488281
26408/28840	I said they would skin me thought Danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said Come how much do I owe you for this fowl   Your excellency has given me a louis on	115.97493743896484
26409/28840	A louis on account for a fowl   Certainly and your excellency now owes me 4999 lou	228.29623413085938
26410/28840	Danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic	91.72159576416016
26411/28840	Very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when Peppino stopped the barons right hand with his left and held out his other	150.6291046142578
26412/28840	Is it not a joke said Dangl	35.75982666015625
26413/28840	We never joke replied Peppino solemn as a Qu	215.66163635253906
26414/28840	Stay here is another louis for	97.51917266845703
26415/28840	Then that will make only 4998 louis more said Peppino with the same	382.69268798828125
26416/28840	I shall get them all in	146.00405883789062
26417/28840	Oh as for that said Danglars angry at this prolongation of the jestas for that you wont get them at	215.3162841796875
26418/28840	Go to the devil You do not know with whom you have to deal   50253m       Peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the f	67.13753509521484
26419/28840	Danglars threw himself upon his goatskin and Peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and	779.5643920898438
26420/28840	Though Danglars could not see Peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his	69.27647399902344
26421/28840	He was certainly eating and noisily too like an illbred	521.248291015625
26422/28840	Peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat	200.22300720214844
26423/28840	Danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another halfhour which appeared to him like a	136.30532836914062
26424/28840	He again arose and went to the	52.22737121582031
26425/28840	Come sir do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they	243.6978759765625
26426/28840	Nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you	41.725440979003906
26427/28840	Give your orders and we will execute	128.25384521484375
26428/28840	Now look here I want something to eat To eatdo you hear   Are you hungry   Come you understand	152.44166564941406
26429/28840	What would your excellency like to eat   A piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed	124.32669067382812
26430/28840	Four thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight louis said Peppino You have paid two louis in	332.6948547363281
26431/28840	50255m       What One hundred thousand francs for a loaf   One hundred thousand francs repeated Pepp	40.219364166259766
26432/28840	But you only asked 100000 francs for a fowl   We have a fixed price for all our	207.60348510742188
26433/28840	It signifies nothing whether you eat much or littlewhether you have ten dishes or oneit is always the same	1466.339599609375
26434/28840	What still keeping up this silly jest My dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculousstupid You had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to	785.3048095703125
26435/28840	Oh dear no your excellency unless you intend to commit	251.1611785888672
26436/28840	And what am I to pay with brute said Danglars	180.15293884277344
26437/28840	Do you suppose I carry 100000 francs in my pocket   Your excellency has 5050000 francs in your pocket that will be fifty fowls at 100000 francs apiece and half a fowl for the 5	103.6028060913086
26438/28840	The bandage fell from his eyes and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just	108.90583038330078
26439/28840	Come he said if I pay you the 100000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease   Certainly said Pepp	61.7457389831543
26440/28840	But how can I pay them   Oh nothing easier you have an account open with Mess	275.101806640625
26441/28840	Thomson  French Via dei Banchi Rome give me a draft for 4998 louis on these gentlemen and our banker shall take	1288.282958984375
26442/28840	Danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and paper Peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed	102.115234375
26443/28840	Here he said here is a draft at	206.76571655273438
26444/28840	Danglars sighed while he carved the fowl it appeared very thin for the price it had	244.6947479248047
26445/28840	As for Peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his	197.89610290527344
26446/28840	The Pardon   The next day Danglars was again hungry certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of	234.3058624267578
26447/28840	The prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his	181.05848693847656
26448/28840	But he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty he had forgotten	254.57225036621094
26449/28840	He struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called	319.3625183105469
26450/28840	The sentinel opened the door it was a new	94.22650909423828
26451/28840	He thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for Pepp	97.23811340332031
26452/28840	Here I am your excellency said Peppino with an eagerness which Danglars thought favorable to	31.31182861328125
26453/28840	What do you want   Something to	65.11109924316406
26454/28840	Your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near	497.5985107421875
26455/28840	Then give me water cried Danglars endeavoring to parry the	106.33267211914062
26456/28840	Oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellencythere has been such a	395.4862060546875
26457/28840	Come thought Danglars it is the same old	40.469993591308594
26458/28840	And while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with pers	252.6090850830078
26459/28840	Come my friend said Danglars seeing that he made no impression on Peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine   I have already told you that we do not sell at	38.27544403076172
26460/28840	Well then let me have a bottle of the least	327.47613525390625
26461/28840	And what is that   Twentyfive thousand francs a	41.61275863647461
26462/28840	Tell me cried Danglars in a tone whose bitterness Harpagon30 alone has been capable of revealingtell me that you wish to despoil me of all it will be sooner over than devouring me piece	1268.67236328125
26463/28840	It is possible such may be the masters	375.2561950683594
26464/28840	The masterwho is he   The person to whom you were conducted	192.17457580566406
26465/28840	And the next moment Luigi Vampa appeared before Dangl	66.2336196899414
26466/28840	You sent for me he said to the	30.210241317749023
26467/28840	Are you sir the chief of the people who brought me here   Yes your excell	23.97314453125
26468/28840	What then   How much do you require for my ransom   Merely the 5000000 you have about	119.44892883300781
26469/28840	Danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his	186.0137481689453
26470/28840	But this is all I have left in the world he said out of an immense	47.25766372680664
26471/28840	If you deprive me of that take away my life	288.7652587890625
26472/28840	We are forbidden to shed your	804.0883178710938
26473/28840	And by whom are you forbidden   By him we	309.7640075683594
26474/28840	You do then obey someone   Yes a	186.80181884765625
26475/28840	I thought you said you were the chief   So I am of these men but there is another over	86.73361206054688
26476/28840	And did your superior order you to treat me in this way  	85.95341491699219
26477/28840	Come said Danglars will you take a million  	18.44194221496582
26478/28840	Two millionsthreefour Come four I will give them to you on condition that you let me	445.92364501953125
26479/28840	Why do you offer me 4000000 for what is worth 5000000 This is a kind of usury banker that I do not	515.3982543945312
26480/28840	Take all thentake all I tell you and kill me   Come come calm	221.01805114746094
26481/28840	You will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to	170.8757781982422
26482/28840	But when I have no more money left to pay you asked the infuriated Dangl	93.06165313720703
26483/28840	But you say you do not wish to kill me  	20.911483764648438
26484/28840	And yet you will let me perish with hunger   Ah that is a different	66.50448608398438
26485/28840	Danglars raving threw himself on the goats	337.6452331542969
26486/28840	Danglars meditated an escape but the walls were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually	634.0267944335938
26487/28840	His resolution not to sign lasted two days after which he offered a million for some	399.31109619140625
26488/28840	They sent him a magnificent supper and took his	450.0992126464844
26489/28840	From this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he	152.60574340820312
26490/28840	At the end of twelve days after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only 50000 francs	86.66378784179688
26491/28840	Three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not	3612.74658203125
26492/28840	Sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet he also was dying of	125.4859619140625
26493/28840	On the fourth he was no longer a man but a living	98.46119689941406
26494/28840	He had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his	319.9722595214844
26495/28840	Then he entreated Peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him 1000 francs for a mouthful of	195.82188415527344
26496/28840	On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the	76.46451568603516
26497/28840	Are you not a Christian he said falling on his	107.04234313964844
26498/28840	Do you wish to assassinate a man who in the eyes of Heaven is a brother Oh my former friends my former friends he murmured and fell with his face to the	92.20597839355469
26499/28840	Yes those who have died of	130.08837890625
26500/28840	Danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his	39.66534423828125
26501/28840	He struck his forehead on the ground and gro	51.66700744628906
26502/28840	Yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than I have but then they must have been martyrs at	94.61559295654297
26503/28840	Do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused Danglars hair to stand on	187.99269104003906
26504/28840	His feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone	141.66017150878906
26505/28840	Of what must I repent stammered Dangl	140.0927276611328
26506/28840	Of the evil you have done said the	109.03973388671875
26507/28840	Oh yes oh yes I do indeed	838.9927368164062
26508/28840	And he struck his breast with his emaciated	1297.3077392578125
26509/28840	Then I forgive you said the man dropping his cloak and advancing to the	146.94557189941406
26510/28840	The Count of Monte Cristo said Danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and	59.53160095214844
26511/28840	You are mistakenI am not the Count of Monte Crist	19.094820022583008
26512/28840	Rise said the count your life is safe the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplicesone is mad the other	194.5784454345703
26513/28840	Keep the 50000 francs you have leftI give them to	50.538150787353516
26514/28840	The 5000000 you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown	2307.83544921875
26515/28840	And now eat and drink I will entertain you	471.65264892578125
26516/28840	Vampa when this man is satisfied let him be	223.0200958251953
26517/28840	Danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits	167.8419952392578
26518/28840	According to the counts directions Danglars was waited on by Vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of Italy then having conducted him to the road and pointed to the postchaise left him leaning against a	112.94979858398438
26519/28840	He remained there all night not knowing where he	227.40618896484375
26520/28840	When daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream he was thirsty and dragged himself towards	177.42227172851562
26521/28840	As he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely	144.41416931152344
26522/28840	The Fifth of October   It was about six oclock in the evening an opalcolored light through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue	638.2625732421875
26523/28840	The heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the	848.487548828125
26524/28840	A delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the Mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the	1285.4136962890625
26525/28840	A light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from Gibraltar to the Dardanelles and from Tunis to	1718.6790771484375
26526/28840	The vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the	522.3939208984375
26527/28840	It advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of	1696.810791015625
26528/28840	The yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young	264.7920227050781
26529/28840	Standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a	164.95022583007812
26530/28840	Is that Monte Cristo asked the traveller to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted in a melancholy	170.73300170898438
26531/28840	Yes your excellency said the captain we have reached	23.406482696533203
26532/28840	We have reached it repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable	121.4366455078125
26533/28840	Then he added in a low tone Yes that is the	221.7917022705078
26534/28840	And then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by	167.992919921875
26535/28840	A few minutes afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the	159.75802612304688
26536/28840	Your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself   What signal   The captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it	134.095458984375
26537/28840	Ah yes he said as if awaking from a	144.5141143798828
26538/28840	The captain gave him a loaded carbine the traveller slowly raised it and fired in the	300.7290344238281
26539/28840	Ten minutes afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little	312.04766845703125
26540/28840	The gig was already lowered and in it were four oarsmen and a coxsw	525.3753662109375
26541/28840	The traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms	241.28897094726562
26542/28840	The rowers waited their oars half lifted out of the water like birds drying their	1081.8133544921875
26543/28840	50265m       Give way said the	50.48554992675781
26544/28840	The eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided	469.07470703125
26545/28840	In an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek the boat grounded on the fine	481.3282470703125
26546/28840	Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men they will carry you ashore The young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference and stepped out of the boat the sea immediately rose to his	105.31404113769531
26547/28840	Ah your excellency murmured the pilot you should not have done so our master will scold us for	121.55245208740234
26548/28840	The young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose a firm	623.4219360351562
26549/28840	Thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite	191.30445861816406
26550/28840	Yes you see I am as exact as you	71.2170181274414
26551/28840	But you are dripping my dear fellow you must change your clothes as Calypso said to Telem	2097.887939453125
26552/28840	Come I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and	141.1519775390625
26553/28840	Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around indeed Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a	136.15106201171875
26554/28840	Already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the	76.3376693725586
26555/28840	Oh yes said the count you are looking for the	30.120075225830078
26556/28840	Yes I paid them nothing and yet they are	191.4055633544922
26557/28840	Never mind that Maximilian said Monte Cristo	21.376609802246094
26558/28840	I have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all	240.21319580078125
26559/28840	Morrel looked at the count with	84.02863311767578
26560/28840	Count he said you are not the same here as in	67.631103515625
26561/28840	How so   Here you	91.34889221191406
26562/28840	You are right to recall me to myself Maximilian he said I was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is	111.7159652709961
26563/28840	Oh no no count cried Maximilian seizing the counts hands pray laugh be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to suff	460.229736328125
26564/28840	Oh how charitable kind and good you are you affect this gayety to inspire me with	689.0308227539062
26565/28840	You are wrong Morrel I was really	154.9422149658203
26566/28840	Then you forget me so much the	30.573165893554688
26567/28840	How so   Yes for as the gladiator said to the emperor when he entered the arena He who is about to die salutes	161.177490234375
26568/28840	Then you are not consoled asked the count	127.29352569580078
26569/28840	Oh exclaimed Morrel with a glance full of bitter reproach do you think it possible that I could be   Listen said the	54.02423858642578
26570/28840	Do you understand the meaning of my words You cannot take me for a commonplace man a mere rattle emitting a vague and senseless	562.5786743164062
26571/28840	When I ask you if you are consoled I speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no	77.57638549804688
26572/28840	Well Morrel let us both examine the depths of your	126.19612884521484
26573/28840	Count said Morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth I come to die in the arms of a	92.28040313720703
26574/28840	Certainly there are people whom I	125.48775482177734
26575/28840	I love my sister JulieI love her husband Emmanuel but I require a strong mind to smile on my last	181.7108917236328
26576/28840	My sister would be bathed in tears and fainting I could not bear to see her	113.43330383300781
26577/28840	Emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand and alarm the house with his	188.45733642578125
26578/28840	No I feel that I have reached the goal and I will go no	98.3853988647461
26579/28840	You told me to wait and hope do you know what you did unfortunate adviser I waited a month or rather I suffered for a month I did hope man is a poor wretched creature I did	298.1390075683594
26580/28840	What I cannot tellsomething wonderful an absurdity a miracleof what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call	2658.917724609375
26581/28840	Yes I did waityes I did hope count and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together you have unconsciously wounded tortured my heart for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for	382.87939453125
26582/28840	Oh count I shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arms of	529.4148559570312
26583/28840	Morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count	180.8323516845703
26584/28840	My friend continued Morrel you named the fifth of October as the end of the period of waitingtoday is the fifth of October he took out his watch it is now nine oclockI have yet three hours to	244.79090881347656
26585/28840	Be it so said the count	89.59716796875
26586/28840	Morrel mechanically followed the count and they had entered the grotto before he perceived	109.08794403076172
26587/28840	He felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his	370.9464111328125
26588/28840	Morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he	1535.191650390625
26589/28840	As you please he said death is always deaththat is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from	701.6005249023438
26590/28840	He sat down and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to	39.54692077636719
26591/28840	They were in the marvellous diningroom before described where the statues had baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and	331.6546936035156
26592/28840	Morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed	1035.79052734375
26593/28840	Let us talk like men he said looking at the	111.8118896484375
26594/28840	Go on   Count said Morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than	303.1884460449219
26595/28840	There is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome I have descended from a planet called	161.17471313476562
26596/28840	50269m       I believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning for instance you told me to live and I did live you told me to hope and I almost did	77.96200561523438
26597/28840	I am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die   Monte Cristo looked upon Morrel with indescribable tender	47.4879150390625
26598/28840	Yes he said yes doubtless it is painful if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for	1413.0142822265625
26599/28840	If you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disordersthen certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a	438.0554504394531

26623/28840	Yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure	516.7760620117188
26624/28840	He placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret	179.20013427734375
26625/28840	This box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the	732.8234252929688
26626/28840	It was a mixed mass of blue red and	557.1361694335938
26627/28840	The count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to Morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon	175.7822723388672
26628/28840	It was then observable that the substance was green	1080.2108154296875
26629/28840	This is what you asked for he said and what I promised to give	49.1921501159668
26630/28840	I thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of Monte Crist	28.99380874633789
26631/28840	The count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden	958.4486083984375
26632/28840	What are you going to do my friend asked Morrel arresting his	46.75041198730469
26633/28840	Well the fact is Morrel I was thinking that I too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itself   Stay said the young	109.58071899414062

26636/28840	Adieu my noble and generous friend adieu I will go and tell Valentine what you have done for	97.53276062011719
26637/28840	And slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the counts hand fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by Monte Crist	344.54351806640625

26640/28840	Seated opposite to him Monte Cristo watched him in the shadow and Morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the	63.22910690307617
26641/28840	An overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hands relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the	551.9207763671875
26642/28840	50273m       Friend he cried I feel that I am dying thanks   He made a last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside	82.70771026611328
26643/28840	Then it appeared to him that Monte Cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a	89.66609954833984
26644/28840	At the same time the count appeared to increase in stature his form nearly double its usual height stood out in relief against the red tapestry his black hair was thrown back and he stood in the attitude of an avenging	246.5713348388672
26645/28840	Morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor permeated every	1765.8492431640625
26646/28840	A change of ideas presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleid	1507.675048828125
26647/28840	Enervated prostrate and breathless he became unconscious of outward objects he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding	770.3944091796875

26649/28840	He wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a stone at the mouth of a sepulch	187.62112426757812
26650/28840	Involuntarily his languid eyes closed and still through his eyelashes a wellknown form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself envelop	792.5977172851562
26651/28840	The count had just opened a	119.3757095336914
26652/28840	Immediately a brilliant light from the next room or rather from the palace adjoining shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last	268.4067687988281
26653/28840	Then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two	107.37376403808594
26654/28840	Pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of	484.3426818847656

26762/28840	DArtagnan was a woman and still more a	35.667213439941406

26765/28840	The same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for	182.28565979003906

26767/28840	With such a _vade mecum_ DArtagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his	1926.88525390625
26768/28840	DArtagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of Me	762.7926635742188
26769/28840	DArtagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and	55.6265983581543
26770/28840	This time DArtagnan was only in part mistaken he himself was not in question but his horse	90.74720001220703
26771/28840	The gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors and as I have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of	466.4012451171875
26772/28840	Now as a halfsmile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily	426.3933410644531
26773/28840	Nevertheless DArtagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed	92.3659439086914
26774/28840	He fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to fortyfive years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and wellshaped	356.13653564453125
26775/28840	He was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt	672.478515625
26776/28840	This doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmante	1189.5198974609375
26777/28840	DArtagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future	86.52245330810547
26778/28840	This time there could be no doubt DArtagnan was really	41.98282241821289
26779/28840	Unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious	328.0298767089844
26780/28840	But I am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and	308.1520080566406
26781/28840	The stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of DArtagn	79.65480041503906
26782/28840	His quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking and who still remained at the	75.74222564697266

26787/28840	But DArtagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule	102.63861083984375
26788/28840	He drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying Turn turn Master Joker lest I strike you behind   Strike me said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as	469.04833984375
26789/28840	Why my good fellow you must be mad Then in a suppressed tone as if speaking to himself This is annoying continued	344.6626281738281
26790/28840	The stranger then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery drew his sword saluted his adversary and seriously placed himself on	286.42437744140625

26793/28840	When he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of	111.49217987060547
26794/28840	But the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with DArtagnan was not the man ever to cry for	127.26403045654297
26795/28840	The fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds but at length DArtagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a	151.479248046875
26796/28840	Another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to the ground covered with blood and almost fain	96.15168762207031

26805/28840	Why this fellow must be the devil in person cried the	191.0023956298828
26806/28840	Then said the stranger coolly he must be some prince in	148.537841796875

26809/28840	What was there in it   A letter addressed to Monsieur de Tréville captain of the Musket	38.711822509765625

26815/28840	Host said he could you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy for me In conscience I cannot kill him and yet added he with a coldly menacing expression he annoys	409.2347412109375
26816/28840	Where is he   In my wifes chamber on the first flight where they are dressing his	139.68917846679688

26823/28840	That is well do as I have directed you	182.7244415283203
26824/28840	What the devil said the host to	65.10572052001953
26825/28840	Can he be afraid of this boy But an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short he bowed humbly and	410.6221923828125
26826/28840	It is not necessary for Milady to be seen by this fellow continued the	100.8928451538086
26827/28840	She will soon pass she is already	463.5804443359375
26828/28840	I had better get on horseback and go and meet	164.78097534179688
26829/28840	I should like however to know what this letter addressed to Tréville	165.21559143066406
26830/28840	And the stranger muttering to himself directed his steps toward the	304.35272216796875
26831/28840	We are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family	1417.21484375
26832/28840	But we find it thus in the manuscript and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter	123.08566284179688
26833/28840	In the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry reascended to his wifes chamber and found DArtagnan just recovering his	157.4530487060547
26834/28840	His interlocutor whose head appeared through the carriage window was a woman of from twenty to twoandtwenty	261.4744567871094
26835/28840	We have already observed with what rapidity DArtagnan seized the expression of a count	47.19802474975586
26836/28840	He perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which DArtagnan had hitherto	258.6998291015625
26837/28840	She was pale and fair with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders had large blue languishing eyes rosy lips and hands of alab	1314.630126953125
26838/28840	She was talking with great animation with the	207.82318115234375
26839/28840	His Eminence then orders me said the	673.1923828125
26840/28840	To return instantly to England and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves	193.38937377929688
26841/28840	And as to my other instructions asked the fair	455.53643798828125
26842/28840	They are contained in this box which you will not open until you are on the other side of the	91.64473724365234
26843/28840	Very well and youwhat will you do   II return to	91.98960876464844
26844/28840	What without chastising this insolent boy asked the	2233.883544921875
26845/28840	The stranger was about to reply but at the moment he opened his mouth DArtagnan who had heard all precipitated himself over the threshold of the	70.75782012939453
26846/28840	This insolent boy chastises others cried he and I hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as	420.8782653808594
26847/28840	Will not escape him replied the stranger knitting his	551.0327758789062
26848/28840	No before a woman you would dare not fly I presume   Remember said Milady seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword the least delay may ruin	238.50575256347656
26849/28840	You are right cried the gentleman begone then on your part and I will depart as quickly on	230.1394500732422
26850/28840	And bowing to the lady he sprang into his saddle while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his	183.40724182128906
26851/28840	The two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gall	1449.2396240234375
26852/28840	Pay him booby cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his	365.8572082519531
26853/28840	Base coward false gentleman cried DArtagnan springing forward in his turn after the	89.59690856933594
26854/28840	But his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exert	288.5367736816406
26855/28840	Yes a base coward murmured DArtagnan but sheshe was very	144.6209716796875
26856/28840	Milady faltered DArtagnan and fainted a second	40.618385314941406
26857/28840	Ah its all one said the host I have lost two customers but this one remains of whom I am pretty certain for some days to	233.6981964111328
26858/28840	It is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in DArtagnans	148.4517364501953
26859/28840	The host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his	463.00054931640625
26860/28840	Hence it resulted when DArtagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabb	202.0463104248047
26861/28840	As to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding	240.75193786621094
26862/28840	But this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly	463.35614013671875
26863/28840	But after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter   Yes where is this letter cried DArtagn	52.89236068725586
26864/28840	In the first place I warn you that that letter is for Monsieur de Tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find	35.288272857666016
26865/28840	His threat completed the intimidation of the	3822.60986328125
26866/28840	After the king and the cardinal	73.9142074584961
26867/28840	de Tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by	134.80137634277344
26868/28840	There was to be sure Father Joseph but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice such was the terror inspired by his Gray Eminence as the cardinals familiar was	724.1310424804688
26869/28840	Throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost	1137.5684814453125
26870/28840	Does the letter contain anything valuable demanded the host after a few minutes of useless	805.5106201171875
26871/28840	Zounds I think it does indeed cried the Gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at	139.0941619873047
26872/28840	It contained my fortune   Bills upon Spain asked the disturbed	3355.47021484375
26873/28840	Bills upon his Majestys private treasury answered DArtagnan who reckoning upon entering into the kings service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a	1087.4342041015625
26874/28840	The devil cried the host at his wits	514.2554931640625
26875/28840	But its of no importance continued DArtagnan with natural assurance its of no	436.17559814453125
26876/28840	The money is nothing that letter was	608.619873046875
26877/28840	I would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost	101.84579467773438
26878/28840	He would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand but a certain juvenile modesty restrained	528.40478515625
26879/28840	A ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding	203.3375701904297
26880/28840	That letter is not lost cried	479.2389221191406
26881/28840	No it has been stolen from	149.987060546875
26882/28840	Stolen By whom   By the gentleman who was here	156.1688995361328
26883/28840	He came down into the kitchen where your doublet	156.0519561767578
26884/28840	I would lay a wager he has stolen	117.26912689208984
26885/28840	Do you think so answered DArtagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cup	197.57627868652344
26886/28840	The fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this	384.8211975097656
26887/28840	Do you say resumed DArtagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman   I tell you I am sure of it continued the	33.90569305419922
26888/28840	I will complain to Monsieur de Tréville and Monsieur de Tréville will complain to the	15.77917194366455
26889/28840	He then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of	130.0068359375
26890/28840	Antoine at Paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that DArtagnan had ridden him hard during the last	171.79539489746094
26891/28840	Thus the dealer to whom DArtagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his	106.38922119140625
26892/28840	Thus DArtagnan entered Paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his	343.6207580566406
26893/28840	This chamber was a sort of garret situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs near the	425.5791931152344

26895/28840	Next he went to the Quai de Feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the Louvre inquiring of the first Musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of	149.57395935058594
26896/28840	de Tréville which proved to be in the Rue du VieuxColombier that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by DArtagnana circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his	287.3007507324219
26897/28840	After this satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at Meung without remorse for the past confident in the present and full of hope for the future he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the	161.25167846679688

26903/28840	He was the friend of the king who honored highly as everyone knows the memory of his father Henry	218.97372436523438
26904/28840	This was a great matter in the way of honor but very little in the way of wealth so that when the illustrious companion of the great Henry died the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his	188.44581604003906
26905/28840	Thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it	724.8475341796875
26906/28840	de Tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that Louis	254.95782470703125
26907/28840	one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and Tréville nextor even perhaps before	197.1619873046875

26911/28840	In short up to this period nothing had been wanting to Tréville but opportunity but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his	205.63970947265625
26912/28840	made Tréville the captain of his Musketeers who were to Louis	93.25186920166016
26913/28840	in devotedness or rather in fanaticism what his Ordinaries had been to Henry	6568.0634765625
26914/28840	and his Scotch Guard to Louis	68918.984375
26915/28840	On his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this	123.11178588867188
26916/28840	When he saw the formidable and chosen body with which Louis	305.9668884277344
26917/28840	had surrounded himself this second or rather this first king of France became desirous that he too should have his	323.4886169433594
26918/28840	He had his Musketeers therefore as Louis	721.75830078125
26919/28840	had his and these two powerful rivals vied with each other in procuring not only from all the provinces of France but even from all foreign states the most celebrated swords	632.5848388671875
26920/28840	It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis	145.29981994628906
26921/28840	to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their	853.9280395507812
26922/28840	Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own	203.2721405029297
26923/28840	While exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls they excited them secretly to quarrel deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own	2709.3623046875
26924/28840	We learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these	585.0430908203125
26925/28840	Tréville had grasped the weak side of his master and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his	266.0171813964844
26926/28840	He paraded his Musketeers before the Cardinal Armand Duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his Eminence curl with	1554.509033203125

26932/28840	de Tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king in the first place and the friends of the kingand then for himself and his own	119.90837860107422
26933/28840	For the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the	441.0427551269531
26934/28840	In no instance let us say was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his	2441.065673828125

26941/28840	The court of his hôtel situated in the Rue du VieuxColombier resembled a camp from by six oclock in the morning in summer and eight oclock in	393.1046447753906
26942/28840	From fifty to sixty Musketeers who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number paraded constantly armed to the teeth and ready for	835.2760009765625
26943/28840	In the antechamber upon long circular benches reposed the elect that is to say those who were	321.90478515625
26944/28840	In this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night while	5002.154296875

26946/28840	The day on which DArtagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his	301.5997314453125
26947/28840	It is true that this provincial was a Gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of DArtagnan had the reputation of not being easily	250.76771545410156
26948/28840	When he had once passed the massive door covered with long squareheaded nails he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen who crossed one another in their passage calling out quarreling and playing tricks one with	423.7633972167969

26950/28840	Arrived at the staircase it was still	452.8614501953125
26951/28840	There were four Musketeers on the bottom steps amusing themselves with the following exercise while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the	423.95703125

26953/28840	These three others fenced against him with their agile	3145.14306640625
26954/28840	He who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries marvelously in	946.4361572265625
26955/28840	The conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit	634.3153076171875
26956/28840	In five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained intacta piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of	691.889892578125
26957/28840	However difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished	286.28875732421875
26958/28840	He had seen in his provincethat land in which heads become so easily heateda few of the preliminaries of duels but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in Gascon	606.0447387695312
26959/28840	He believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into which Gulliver afterward went and was so frightened and yet he had not gained the goal for there were still the landing place and the antech	503.8802795410156
26960/28840	On the landing they were no longer fighting but amused themselves with stories about women and in the antechamber with stories about the	267.68255615234375
26961/28840	On the landing DArtagnan blushed in the antechamber he tremb	33.083126068115234
26962/28840	But if his morals were shocked on the landing his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antech	335.94195556640625
26963/28840	There to his great astonishment DArtagnan heard the policy which made all Europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry	224.2828826904297
26964/28840	That great man who was so revered by DArtagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the Musketeers of Tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked	268.5700988769531

26966/28840	Nevertheless when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering	527.212890625
26967/28840	They looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of	235.83689880371094
26968/28840	de Tréville but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his Eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his	251.9830322265625

26972/28840	At this demand DArtagnan gave his name very modestly emphasized the title of compatriot and begged the servant who had put the question to him to request a moments audience of	401.7168884277344

26975/28840	The center of the most animated group was a Musketeer of great height and haughty countenance dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general	346.18768310546875
26976/28840	A long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders disclosing in front the splendid baldric from which was suspended a gigantic rap	3066.469482421875
26977/28840	This Musketeer had just come off guard complained of having a cold and coughed from time to time affected	676.9091796875
26978/28840	It was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and DArtagnan more than	133.00758361816406
26979/28840	What would you have said the Musket	84.22017669677734
26980/28840	It is a folly I admit but still it is the	219.28855895996094
26981/28840	Besides one must lay out ones inheritance	2109.918701171875
26982/28840	Ah Porthos cried one of his companions dont try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal	378.494873046875
26983/28840	It was given to you by that veiled lady I met you with the other Sunday near the gate	305.14337158203125
26984/28840	No upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman I bought it with the contents of my own purse answered he whom they designated by the name Porth	157.23239135742188
26985/28840	Yes about in the same manner said another Musketeer that I bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old	366.03436279296875
26986/28840	Its true though said Porthos and the proof is that I paid twelve pistoles for	139.5907745361328
26987/28840	The wonder was increased though the doubt continued to	1418.59326171875
26988/28840	Is it not true Aramis said Porthos turning toward another Musket	98.50519561767578
26989/28840	This other Musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator who had just designated him by the name of Aram	247.6433563232422
26990/28840	He was a stout man of about two or threeandtwenty with an open ingenuous countenance a black mild eye and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn	613.9258422851562
26991/28840	His delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink	1236.2269287109375
26992/28840	Habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great	509.2843017578125
26993/28840	He answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the	194.15554809570312
26994/28840	This affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the bald	3061.96630859375
26995/28840	They continued to admire it but said no more about it and with a rapid change of thought the conversation passed suddenly to another	208.77171325683594
26996/28840	What do you think of the story Chalaiss esquire relates asked another Musketeer without addressing anyone in particular but on the contrary speaking to	577.5176391601562
26997/28840	And what does he say asked Porthos in a selfsufficient	206.5481414794922
26998/28840	He relates that he met at Brussels Rochefort the _âme damnée_ of the cardinal disguised as a Capuchin and that this cursed Rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked Monsieur de Laigues like a ninny as he	1141.447998046875
26999/28840	A ninny indeed said Porthos but is the matter certain   I had it from Aramis replied the Musket	119.70785522460938
27000/28840	Indeed   Why you knew it Porthos said Aram	20.628711700439453
27001/28840	Let us say no more about	87.37137603759766
27002/28840	Say no more about it Thats _your_ opinion replied Porth	209.32855224609375
27003/28840	Say no more about it _Peste_ You come to your conclusions	561.2055053710938
27004/28840	You unraveled it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news you come and tell us today Let us say no more about	171.80226135253906
27005/28840	Well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied Aramis	109.93761444091797
27006/28840	This Rochefort cried Porthos if I were the esquire of poor Chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with	257.3990783691406
27007/28840	And youyou would pass rather a sad quarterhour with the Red Duke replied Aram	2448.37255859375

27011/28840	You very well know Porthos that I continue to study theology for that	184.67120361328125

27013/28840	He only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock which hangs behind his uniform said another Musket	563.3633422851562
27014/28840	What is he waiting for asked	401.22357177734375
27015/28840	Only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of	115.48634338378906

27017/28840	Your wit is always leading you beyond bounds if Monsieur de Tréville heard you you would repent of speaking	347.6575012207031
27018/28840	Are you going to give me a lesson Porthos cried Aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like	149.07342529296875

27048/28840	They stamped upon the carpet with their feet they bit their lips till the blood came and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their	463.4226379394531
27049/28840	All without had heard as we have said Athos Porthos and Aramis called and had guessed from	54.62814712524414

27051/28840	In an instant from the door of the cabinet to the street gate the whole hôtel was	258.55157470703125
27052/28840	Ah The kings Musketeers are arrested by the Guards of the cardinal are they continued	375.643798828125
27053/28840	de Tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of a stiletto into the bosoms of his aud	533.2590942382812
27054/28840	At these words the murmur without became an explosion nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphem	499.16436767578125

27056/28840	DArtagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the	189.21035766601562
27057/28840	Well my Captain said Porthos quite beside himself the truth is that we were six against	308.8388366699219
27058/28840	But we were not captured by fair means and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and Athos grievously wounded was very little	411.6311950683594
27059/28840	Well Captain he endeavored twice to get up and fell again	407.5982666015625
27060/28840	And we did not surrenderno They dragged us away by	727.2998046875
27061/28840	As for Athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him	132.05528259277344

27065/28840	I did not know that replied	51.245723724365234
27066/28840	de Tréville in a somewhat softened	187.6180877685547

27068/28840	You have sent for me sir said Athos to	33.274261474609375

27070/28840	I am here what do you want with me   And at these words the Musketeer in irreproachable costume belted as usual with a tolerably firm step entered the	146.9532012939453

27074/28840	de Tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might without perceiving that Athos whatever might be his selfcommand allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him and if possible grew paler than he was	110.21827697753906
27075/28840	The door had remained open so strong was the excitement produced by the arrival of Athos whose wound though kept as a secret was known to	189.4196014404297
27076/28840	A burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain and two or three heads carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment appeared through the openings of the tapest	107.49024200439453
27077/28840	de Tréville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette when he felt the hand of Athos who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain at length overcome by it fell upon the floor as if he were	322.5207214355469

27079/28840	de Tréville the whole assemblage rushed into the cabinet he not thinking to shut the door against anyone and all crowded round the wounded	163.0740509033203
27080/28840	But all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the hô	238.58773803710938

27082/28840	de Tréville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis who bore their comrade in their	58.87755584716797
27083/28840	Behind this group walked the surgeon and behind the surgeon the door	455.27410888671875

27086/28840	An instant after Porthos and Aramis reentered the surgeon and	39.971858978271484
27087/28840	de Tréville alone remaining with the	330.67626953125
27088/28840	The injured man had recovered his	520.9195556640625

27091/28840	When all had gone out and the door was closed	102.43926239013672
27092/28840	de Tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young	104.20448303222656
27093/28840	The event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his	180.5275421142578
27094/28840	He inquired what was the will of his persevering	305.3525390625
27095/28840	DArtagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past	124.40193939208984
27096/28840	Pardon me said he smiling pardon me my dear compatriot but I had wholly forgotten	707.650390625
27097/28840	But what help is there for it A captain is nothing but a father of a family charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary	222.6078643798828
27098/28840	Soldiers are big children but as I maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed   DArtagnan could not restrain a	105.52339935302734
27099/28840	de Tréville judged that he had not to deal with a fool and changing the conversation came straight to the	136.9597625732422
27100/28840	I respected your father very much said	214.53842163085938
27101/28840	What can I do for the son Tell me quickly my time is not my	181.14578247070312
27102/28840	It is indeed a favor young man replied	405.7916259765625
27103/28840	de Tréville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to	85.96521759033203
27104/28840	But his majestys decision is always necessary and I inform you with regret that no one becomes a Musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than	518.7140502929688
27105/28840	DArtagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the Musketeers uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of	667.600341796875
27106/28840	de Tréville fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart on account of my old companion your father as I have said I will do something for you young	137.42726135253906
27107/28840	Our recruits from Béarn are not generally very rich and I have no reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since I left the	532.2688598632812
27108/28840	I dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you   DArtagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said I ask alms of no	107.788818359375
27109/28840	Oh thats very well young man continued	383.28985595703125
27110/28840	I know these airs I myself came to Paris with four crowns in my purse and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me I was not in a condition to purchase the Lou	117.4806900024414
27111/28840	Thanks to the sale of his horse he commenced his career with four more crowns than	201.1313934326172
27112/28840	de Tréville possessed at the commencement of	68.82449340820312
27113/28840	You ought I say then to husband the means you have however large the sum may be but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a	490.9854736328125
27114/28840	I will write a letter today to the Director of the Royal Academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to	477.0321960449219
27115/28840	Our bestborn and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain	674.8771362304688
27116/28840	You will learn horsemanship swordsmanship in all its branches and	5487.6494140625
27117/28840	You will make some desirable acquaintances and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether I can be of further service to	116.78950500488281
27118/28840	DArtagnan stranger as he was to all the manners of a court could not but perceive a little coldness in this	188.16676330566406
27119/28840	Alas sir said he I cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to	143.6925811767578
27120/28840	de Tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor Béarn	1168.93408203125
27121/28840	I had one sir and thank God such as I could wish cried DArtagnan but it was perfidiously stolen from	284.47320556640625
27122/28840	He then related the adventure of Meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted	735.1396484375
27123/28840	This is all very strange said	110.67868041992188
27124/28840	de Tréville after meditating a minute you mentioned my name then aloud   Yes sir I certainly committed that imprudence but why should I have done otherwise A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my	254.08096313476562
27125/28840	Judge if I should not put myself under its	256.1324768066406
27126/28840	Flattery was at that period very current and	580.095947265625
27127/28840	de Tréville loved incense as well as a king or even a	333.6539306640625
27128/28840	Was he not a finelooking man  	260.33734130859375
27129/28840	He departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he	453.7020568847656
27130/28840	You know not the subject of their conversation   He gave her a box told her not to open it except in	142.5668182373047
27131/28840	Was this woman English   He called her Mil	231.49276733398438
27132/28840	It is he it must be he murmured Tré	48.87932586669922
27133/28840	Oh sir if you know who this man is cried DArtagnan tell me who he is and whence he	66.89501953125
27134/28840	I will then release you from all your promiseseven that of procuring my admission into the Musketeers for before everything I wish to avenge	310.8656311035156
27135/28840	If you see him coming on one side of the street pass by on the	73.1505126953125
27136/28840	Do not cast yourself against such a rock he would break you like	517.9340209960938
27137/28840	That will not prevent me replied DArtagnan if ever I find	38.129974365234375
27138/28840	In the meantime said Tréville seek him notif I have a right to advise	252.60475158691406
27139/28840	All at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden	205.5561981201172
27140/28840	He was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected	882.6185913085938
27141/28840	I know he is a Gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for	78.7599105834961
27142/28840	The king and the cardinal are the best of friends their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive	945.6864013671875
27143/28840	I am not willing that a compatriot a handsome cavalier a brave youth quite fit to make his way should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by	313.3973388671875
27144/28840	Be assured that I am devoted to both these allpowerful masters and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king and also the cardinalone of the most illustrious geniuses that France has ever	274.6202697753906
27145/28840	Now young man regulate your conduct accordingly and if you entertain whether from your family your relations or even from your instincts any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal bid me adieu and let us	939.3361206054688
27146/28840	I will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my	771.5535278320312
27147/28840	I hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend for you are the only young man to whom I have hitherto spoken as I have done to	50.095951080322266
27148/28840	Tréville said to himself If the cardinal has set this young fox upon me he will certainly not have failedhe who knows how bitterly I execrate himto tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at	546.3331298828125
27149/28840	Therefore in spite of all my protestations if it be as I suspect my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his Eminence in	319.36419677734375
27150/28840	DArtagnan answered with the greatest simplicity I came to Paris with exactly such	120.61015319824219
27151/28840	My father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourselfwhom he considered the first three personages in	454.4369201660156
27152/28840	de Tréville to the others as may be perceived but he thought this addition would do no	147.03346252441406
27153/28840	I have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his	127.76493072509766
27154/28840	But I still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all	189.35919189453125
27155/28840	de Tréville was surprised to the greatest	109.17594146728516
27156/28840	So much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his	1903.2960205078125
27157/28840	The more this young man was superior to others the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive	168.1033477783203
27158/28840	Nevertheless he pressed DArtagnans hand and said to him You are an honest youth but at the present moment I can only do for you that which I just now	91.3280258178711
27159/28840	My hôtel will be always open to	666.1967163085938
27160/28840	Hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you	199.07566833496094
27161/28840	That is to say replied DArtagnan that you will wait until I have proved myself worthy of	45.63755798339844
27162/28840	Well be assured added he with the familiarity of a Gascon you shall not wait	134.82144165039062
27163/28840	And he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own	72.00814056396484
27164/28840	I promised you a letter for the director of the	90.11273193359375
27165/28840	de Tréville smiled at this flourish and leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window where they had talked together he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised letter of	284.1737060546875
27166/28840	While he was doing this DArtagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the Musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they	224.68385314941406
27167/28840	de Tréville after having written the letter sealed it and rising approached the young man in order to give it to	88.61715698242188
27168/28840	But at the very moment when DArtagnan stretched out his hand to receive it	20.943422317504883
27169/28840	de Tréville was highly astonished to see his _protégé_ make a sudden spring become crimson with passion and rush from the cabinet crying Sblood he shall not escape me this time   And who asked	449.8782043457031
27170/28840	The devil take the madman murmured	167.9829864501953
27171/28840	de Trévilles private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a how	775.0546875
27172/28840	Excuse me said DArtagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but I am in a	50.43588638305664
27173/28840	Scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped	218.30055236816406
27174/28840	You are in a hurry said the Musketeer as pale as a	96.72881317138672
27175/28840	Under that pretense you run against me You say Excuse me and you believe that is sufficient Not at all my young	148.0408935546875
27176/28840	Do you fancy because you have heard Monsieur de Tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us Undeceive yourself comrade you are not Monsieur de Tré	92.89472961425781
27177/28840	My faith replied DArtagnan recognizing Athos who after the dressing performed by the doctor was returning to his own	72.44656372070312
27178/28840	I did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally I said Excuse	1048.3438720703125
27179/28840	It appears to me that this is quite	32.393150329589844
27180/28840	I repeat to you however and this time on my word of honorI think perhaps too oftenthat I am in haste great	276.08331298828125
27181/28840	Leave your hold then I beg of you and let me go where my business calls	179.37794494628906
27182/28840	Monsieur said Athos letting him go you are not polite it is easy to perceive that you come from a	83.5140151977539
27183/28840	DArtagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at Athoss last remark he stopped	226.89602661132812
27184/28840	_Morbleu_ monsieur said he however far I may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners I warn	107.39459228515625
27185/28840	Ah If I were not in such haste and if I were not running after someone said DArtagn	49.25202560424805
27186/28840	Monsieur Maninahurry you can find me without running_me_ you understand   And where I pray you   Near the CarmesDesch	1130.5003662109375
27187/28840	At what hour   About	236.25100708007812
27188/28840	About noon That will do I will be	294.7247314453125
27189/28840	Endeavor not to make me wait for at quarter past twelve I will cut off your ears as you	285.7823486328125
27190/28840	Good cried DArtagnan I will be there ten minutes before	29.401784896850586
27191/28840	And he set off running as if the devil possessed him hoping that he might yet find the stranger whose slow pace could not have carried him	283.667236328125
27192/28840	But at the street gate Porthos was talking with the soldier on	121.35282897949219
27193/28840	Between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to	439.689453125
27194/28840	DArtagnan thought it would suffice for him and he sprang forward like a dart between	71.03042602539062
27195/28840	But DArtagnan had reckoned without the	49.08637237548828
27196/28840	As he was about to pass the wind blew out Porthoss long cloak and DArtagnan rushed straight into the middle of	67.0776596069336
27197/28840	DArtagnan hearing the Musketeer swear wished to escape from the cloak which blinded him and sought to find his way from under the folds of	163.68296813964844
27198/28840	He was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of Porthosthat is to say exactly upon the bald	677.1839599609375
27199/28840	Alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff	473.437255859375
27200/28840	Vainglorious as he was Porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least	501.3183288574219
27201/28840	One could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the	190.68661499023438
27202/28840	Bless me cried Porthos making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of DArtagnan who was wriggling about his back you must be mad to run against people in this	370.6645812988281
27203/28840	Excuse me said DArtagnan reappearing under the shoulder of the giant but I am in such hasteI was running after someone and   And do you always forget your eyes when you run asked Porth	85.26878356933594
27204/28840	No replied DArtagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes I can see what other people cannot	77.74747467041016
27205/28840	Whether Porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger Monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub Musketeers in this	248.67164611816406
27206/28840	Chastised Monsieur said DArtagnan the expression is	96.48493957519531
27207/28840	It is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the	136.24366760253906
27208/28840	Ah _pardieu_ I know full well that you dont turn your back to	151.4321746826172
27209/28840	And the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing	742.992431640625
27210/28840	Porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after DArtagn	90.3803939819336
27211/28840	Presently presently cried the latter when you havent your cloak	182.37860107421875
27212/28840	At one oclock then behind the	312.5502624511719
27213/28840	Very well at one oclock then replied DArtagnan turning the angle of the	37.90913009643555
27214/28840	But neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some	248.85430908203125
27215/28840	He began to reflect upon the events that had passed they were numerous and inausp	104.95443725585938
27216/28840	It was scarcely eleven oclock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with	64.98506927490234
27217/28840	de Tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which DArtagnan had left him a little caval	29.844459533691406
27218/28840	Sure of being killed by Athos it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porth	55.39847946166992
27219/28840	The only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at	357.7606506347656
27220/28840	He had good cause to do so the pain I gave him must have been atro	225.6499481201172
27221/28840	As to Porthos that is certainly droll but I am not the less a giddy	90.39229583740234
27222/28840	Ah cursed Gascon that I am I get from one hobble into	614.8621826171875
27223/28840	Friend DArtagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance I would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the	148.9625701904297
27224/28840	You must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of	669.5657958984375
27225/28840	To be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a	1166.3590087890625
27226/28840	Look at Aramis now Aramis is mildness and grace person	591.8900146484375
27227/28840	Well did anybody ever dream of calling Aramis a coward No certainly not and from this moment I will endeavor to model myself after	520.36474609375
27228/28840	de Tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the Musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see	115.08723449707031
27229/28840	DArtagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious	210.3287811279297
27230/28840	All four besides immediately broke off their	1703.672119140625
27231/28840	He was seeking in his mind then for the least awkward means of retreat when he remarked that Aramis had let his handkerchief fall and by mistake no doubt had placed his foot upon	178.30880737304688
27232/28840	This appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his	197.36863708496094
27233/28840	Aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the Gas	157.75779724121094
27234/28840	He perceived his mistake but the friends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young Musketeer with affected	544.739013671875
27235/28840	You make the demand badly replied Aramis and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation I refuse it on account of the	412.3456726074219
27236/28840	The fact is hazarded DArtagnan timidly I did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of Monsieur Aram	58.65970230102539
27237/28840	He had his foot upon it that is all and I thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was	93.37084197998047
27238/28840	And you were deceived my dear sir replied Aramis coldly very little sensible to the rep	84.94987487792969
27239/28840	No upon my honor cried his Majestys Guards	7285.4111328125
27240/28840	You are about to swear upon your honor and I upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have	90.91654968261719
27241/28840	Now here Montaran we will do better than thatlet each take a	1055.2003173828125
27242/28840	Perfectly just cried the other two Guardsmen the judgment of King Solomon Aramis you certainly are full of wisdom   The young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other	470.5063781738281
27243/28840	In a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three Guardsmen and the Musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the Guardsmen going one way and Aramis	1072.3975830078125
27244/28840	Ah monsieur interrupted Aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man	66.78181457519531
27245/28840	What the devil Paris is not paved with cambric   Monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said DArtagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific	598.848388671875
27246/28840	Monsieur what I say to you about the matter said Aramis is not for the sake of seeking a	37.220924377441406
27247/28840	Thank God I am not a bravo And being a Musketeer but for a time I only fight when I am forced to do so and always with great repugnance but this time the affair is serious for here is a lady compromised by	197.6038818359375
27248/28840	Why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief   Why did you so awkwardly let it fall   I have said monsieur and I repeat that the handkerchief did not fall from my	165.05880737304688
27249/28840	And thereby you have lied twice monsieur for I saw it	203.37228393554688
27250/28840	Ah you take it with that tone do you Master Gascon Well I will teach you how to behave	283.5333557128906
27251/28840	And I will send you back to your Mass book Master Abb	762.8206787109375
27252/28840	Draw if you please and instantly   Not so if you please my good friendnot here at	84.58609771728516
27253/28840	I wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to	173.75804138183594
27254/28840	I agree monsieur but do not be too	107.84778594970703
27255/28840	Take your handkerchief whether it belongs to you or another you may perhaps stand in need of	166.40081787109375
27256/28840	At two oclock I shall have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of Monsieur de Tré	26.568828582763672
27257/28840	There I will indicate to you the best place and	181.62356567382812
27258/28840	THE KINGS MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINALS GUARDS     DArtagnan was acquainted with nobody in	32672.0
27259/28840	He went therefore to his appointment with Athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should	202.47520446777344
27260/28840	He reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more	105.12588500976562
27261/28840	He hoped by means of loyal excuses to make a friend of Athos whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him	502.7937316894531
27262/28840	He flattered himself he should be able to frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover Porthos with	254.03880310058594
27263/28840	In addition to this DArtagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart Endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and Monsieur de Tré	167.6317901611328
27264/28840	When DArtagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery Athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve oclock was	123.75721740722656
27265/28840	He was then as punctual as the Samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to	923.0496215820312
27266/28840	Athos who still suffered grievously from his wound though it had been dressed anew by	1602.6817626953125
27267/28840	de Trévilles surgeon was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand his feather even touching the	403.95391845703125
27268/28840	Monsieur said Athos I have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which I am astonished as it is not at all their	66.09993743896484
27269/28840	You know no one but Monsieur de Tréville he	19.382728576660156
27270/28840	Well but then continued Athos speaking half to himself if I kill you I shall have the air of a boys	252.4947967529297
27271/28840	Not too much so replied DArtagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very	124.85358428955078
27272/28840	Very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me devilishly I can tell	955.1663818359375
27273/28840	But I will take the left handit is my custom in such	117.8538589477539
27274/28840	Do not fancy that I do you a favor I use either hand	735.042236328125
27275/28840	And it will be even a disadvantage to you a lefthanded man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for	327.81658935546875
27276/28840	I regret I did not inform you sooner of this	217.82650756835938
27277/28840	You have truly monsieur said DArtagnan bowing again a courtesy for which I assure you I am very	29.498363494873047
27278/28840	You confuse me replied Athos with his gentlemanly air let us talk of something else if you	167.60813903808594
27279/28840	Ah sblood how you have hurt me My shoulder quite	15086.9130859375
27280/28840	If you would permit me said DArtagnan with tim	34.23857116699219
27281/28840	What monsieur   I have a miraculous balsam for woundsa balsam given to me by my mother and of which I have made a trial upon	178.3728485107422
27282/28840	Well   Well I am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you and at the end of three days when you would be curedwell sir it would still do me a great honor to be your	156.1158905029297
27283/28840	DArtagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy without throwing the least doubt upon his	200.96095275878906
27284/28840	_Pardieu_ monsieur said Athos thats a proposition that pleases me not that I can accept it but a league off it savors of the	128.77505493164062
27285/28840	Thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of Charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his	473.8894348144531
27286/28840	Unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known I say that we were to fight and our combat would be	117.73939514160156
27287/28840	I think these fellows will never	379.7331848144531
27288/28840	There is another word which pleases me cried Athos with a gracious nod to DArtagn	63.540504455566406
27289/28840	That did not come from a man without a	60.745140075683594
27290/28840	Monsieur I love men of your kidney and I foresee plainly that if we dont kill each other I shall hereafter have much pleasure in your	339.3398132324219
27291/28840	We will wait for these gentlemen so please you I have plenty of time and it will be more	197.20806884765625
27292/28840	Ah here is one of them I	45.062110900878906
27293/28840	In fact at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos	82.2765121459961
27294/28840	What cried DArtagnan is your first witness Monsieur Porthos   Yes that disturbs you   By no	61.65800476074219
27295/28840	DArtagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos and perceived Aram	53.020992279052734
27296/28840	It is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said Ath	61.38193130493164
27297/28840	My faith replied DArtagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon	320.4886779785156
27298/28840	In the meantime Porthos had come up waved his hand to Athos and then turning toward DArtagnan stood quite	56.028411865234375
27299/28840	Let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his	426.5609130859375
27300/28840	Ah ah said he what does this mean   This is the gentleman I am going to fight with said Athos pointing to DArtagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same	34.867332458496094
27301/28840	Why it is with him I am also going to fight said Porth	49.203338623046875
27302/28840	But not before one oclock replied DArtagn	22.881608963012695
27303/28840	And I also am to fight with this gentleman said Aramis coming in his turn onto the	138.71119689941406
27304/28840	But not until two oclock said DArtagnan with the same calm	21.184097290039062
27305/28840	But what are you going to fight about Athos asked Aram	22.16724395751953
27306/28840	And you Porthos   Faith I am going to fightbecause I am going to fight answered Porthos redd	54.003028869628906
27307/28840	Athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young Gascon as he replied We had a short discussion upon	788.4005737304688
27308/28840	Oh ours is a theological quarrel replied Aramis making a sign to DArtagnan to keep secret the cause of their	179.49029541015625
27309/28840	Athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of DArtagn	70.91031646728516
27310/28840	Augustine upon which we could not agree said the Gas	67.43338012695312
27311/28840	Decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured Ath	171.00953674316406
27312/28840	And now you are assembled gentlemen said DArtagnan permit me to offer you my	79.69073486328125
27313/28840	At this word _apologies_ a cloud passed over the brow of Athos a haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos and a negative sign was the reply of Aram	138.96522521972656
27314/28840	You do not understand me gentlemen said DArtagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the	71.03235626220703
27315/28840	And now gentlemen I repeat excuse me but on that account only andon guard   At these words with the most gallant air possible DArtagnan drew his	130.9783477783203
27316/28840	The blood had mounted to the head of DArtagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the Musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against Athos Porthos and Aram	50.57189178466797
27317/28840	The sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ard	675.6351318359375
27318/28840	That is true Monsieur replied DArtagnan and whether drawn by myself or another I assure you I shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a	92.13188171386719
27319/28840	I will therefore fight in my doublet like	338.0684814453125
27320/28840	Come come enough of such compliments cried Porth	200.6289825439453
27321/28840	Remember we are waiting for our	257.4803466796875
27322/28840	Speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities interrupted Aram	381.46673583984375
27323/28840	For my part I think what they say is very well said and quite worthy of two	114.22445678710938
27324/28840	When you please monsieur said Athos putting himself on	24.002649307250977
27325/28840	I waited your orders said DArtagnan crossing	129.4699249267578
27326/28840	But scarcely had the two rapiers clashed when a company of the Guards of his Eminence commanded by	1161.3514404296875
27327/28840	de Jussac turned the corner of the	360.78692626953125
27328/28840	The cardinals Guards cried Aramis and Porthos at the same	88.29519653320312
27329/28840	Sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords   But it was too	221.26954650878906
27330/28840	The two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their	143.4742431640625
27331/28840	If we were to see you fighting I can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent	77.69062805175781
27332/28840	Leave us alone then and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to	666.0115356445312
27333/28840	Gentlemen said Jussac it is with great regret that I pronounce the thing	1067.6473388671875
27334/28840	Sheathe then if you please and follow	216.43014526367188
27335/28840	Monsieur said Aramis parodying Jussac it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves but unfortunately the thing is impossibleMonsieur de Tréville has forbidden	221.8804473876953
27336/28840	Pass on your way then it is the best thing to	47.901397705078125
27337/28840	We will charge upon you then said he if you disob	264.8392333984375
27338/28840	There are five of them said Athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part I declare I will never appear again before the captain as a conquered	177.92922973632812
27339/28840	Athos Porthos and Aramis instantly drew near one another while Jussac drew up his	257.18536376953125
27340/28840	This short interval was sufficient to determine DArtagnan on the part he was to	120.38480377197266
27341/28840	It was one of those events which decide the life of a man it was a choice between the king and the cardinalthe choice made it must be persisted	116.65474700927734
27342/28840	To fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king	162.5015869140625
27343/28840	All this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a	194.76734924316406
27344/28840	Turning towards Athos and his friends Gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you	87.50816345214844
27345/28840	You said you were but three but it appears to me we are	143.8491668701172
27346/28840	But you are not one of us said Porth	17.460140228271484
27347/28840	Thats true replied DArtagnan I have not the uniform but I have the	68.98588562011719
27348/28840	My heart is that of a Musketeer I feel it monsieur and that impels me	101.30772399902344
27349/28840	Withdraw young man cried Jussac who doubtless by his gestures and the expression of his countenance had guessed DArtagnans	251.79229736328125
27350/28840	You may retire we consent to	283.6869812011719
27351/28840	Decidedly you are a brave fellow said Athos pressing the young mans	77.37651824951172
27352/28840	Come come choose your part replied Juss	3753.07373046875
27353/28840	Well said Porthos to Aramis we must do	19.501510620117188
27354/28840	Monsieur is full of generosity said Ath	70.68807983398438
27355/28840	But all three reflected upon the youth of DArtagnan and dreaded his inexper	468.5495910644531
27356/28840	We should only be three one of whom is wounded with the addition of a boy resumed Athos and yet it will not be the less said we were four	97.33228302001953
27357/28840	Try me gentlemen said he and I swear to you by my honor that I will not go hence if we are	69.89405822753906
27358/28840	What is your name my brave fellow said Ath	49.00776290893555
27359/28840	Well then Athos Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan forward cried Ath	25.72438621520996
27360/28840	Come gentlemen have you decided cried Jussac for the third	493.049072265625
27361/28840	And what is your choice asked Juss	1238.5037841796875
27362/28840	We are about to have the honor of charging you replied Aramis lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the	79.98794555664062
27363/28840	Ah You resist do you cried Juss	4299.75341796875
27364/28840	Sblood does that astonish you   And the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of	347.25567626953125
27365/28840	Athos fixed upon a certain Cahusac a favorite of the card	977.117919921875
27366/28840	Porthos had Bicarat and Aramis found himself opposed to two	827.6416625976562
27367/28840	As to DArtagnan he sprang toward Jussac	125.0588607788086
27368/28840	This contest at length exhausted Jussacs	4992.59375
27369/28840	Furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy he became warm and began to make	571.6720581054688
27370/28840	DArtagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his	348.01971435546875
27371/28840	Jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it and while Jussac was recovering himself glided like a serpent beneath his blade and passed his sword through his	505.9674377441406
27372/28840	DArtagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of	63.331851959228516
27373/28840	Aramis had killed one of his adversaries but the other pressed him warm	214.36314392089844
27374/28840	Nevertheless Aramis was in a good situation and able to defend	99.05162048339844
27375/28840	Bicarat and Porthos had just made counterh	428.1711730957031
27376/28840	Porthos had received a thrust through his arm and Bicarat one through his	941.1707153320312
27377/28840	But neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnest	344.2821960449219
27378/28840	Athos wounded anew by Cahusac became evidently paler but did not give way a	2093.01318359375
27379/28840	He only changed his sword hand and fought with his left	214.13194274902344
27380/28840	According to the laws of dueling at that period DArtagnan was at liberty to assist whom he	91.6571044921875
27381/28840	While he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from Ath	120.24751281738281
27382/28840	Athos would have died rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask	593.0904541015625
27383/28840	DArtagnan interpreted it with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of Cahusac crying To me Monsieur Guardsman I will slay you   Cahusac	1149.4305419921875
27384/28840	It was time for Athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his	335.93218994140625
27385/28840	Sblood cried he to DArtagnan do not kill him young man I beg of	50.54952621459961
27386/28840	I have an old affair to settle with him when I am cured and sound	162.3184356689453
27387/28840	Disarm him onlymake sure of his	1749.62939453125
27388/28840	Thats it Very well done   The exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of Cahusac fly twenty paces from	278.2759094238281
27389/28840	DArtagnan and Cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword but DArtagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon	151.76707458496094
27390/28840	DArtagnan perceived that it would be disobliging Athos not to leave him alone and in a few minutes Cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his	196.03004455566406
27391/28840	At the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for	154.11090087890625
27392/28840	There only then remained Porthos and Bic	2049.665771484375
27393/28840	Porthos made a thousand flourishes asking Bicarat what oclock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brothers having just obtained a company in the regiment of Navarre but jest as he might he gained	857.8922119140625
27394/28840	Bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell	448.23541259765625
27395/28840	The watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinal	982.671630859375
27396/28840	Athos Aramis and DArtagnan surrounded Bicarat and required him to	431.5094299316406
27397/28840	Though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh Bicarat wished to hold out but Jussac who had risen upon his elbow cried out to him to	502.5947570800781
27398/28840	But there are four against you leave off I command	261.16729736328125
27399/28840	Ah if you command me thats another thing said Bic	1557.260009765625
27400/28840	As you are my commander it is my duty to	148.0389862060547
27401/28840	And springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist	276.00250244140625
27402/28840	Bravery is always respected even in an	1826.0640869140625
27403/28840	The Musketeers saluted Bicarat with their swords and returned them to their she	1461.23388671875
27404/28840	Then assisted by Bicarat the only one left standing they bore Jussac Cahusac and one of Aramiss adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the	1383.36083984375
27405/28840	The fourth as we have said was	242.3528289794922
27406/28840	They then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the hôtel of	361.5845031738281
27407/28840	They walked arm in arm occupying the whole width of the street and taking in every Musketeer they met so that in the end it became a triumphal	436.9480895996094
27408/28840	The heart of DArtagnan swam in delirium he marched between Athos and Porthos pressing them tender	89.50326538085938
27409/28840	If I am not yet a Musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of	68.57122039794922
27410/28840	de Tréville scolded his Musketeers in public and congratulated them in private but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king	388.29144287109375
27411/28840	de Tréville hastened to report himself at the Lou	59.89763641357422
27412/28840	The king was closeted with the cardinal and	301.7608337402344
27413/28840	de Tréville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that	75.07624816894531
27414/28840	de Tréville attended the kings gaming	1386.6207275390625
27415/28840	The king was winning and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent	342.4410705566406
27416/28840	de Tréville at a distance   Come here Monsieur Captain said he come here that I may growl at	108.12944793701172
27417/28840	Do you know that his Eminence has been making fresh complaints against your Musketeers and that with so much emotion that this evening his Eminence is indisposed Ah these Musketeers of yours are very devilsfellows to be	726.1312866210938
27418/28840	No sire replied Tréville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire Ill be their	430.3096923828125
27419/28840	And that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majestys	73.97830963134766
27420/28840	But what are they to do The Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them and for the honor of the corps even the poor young men are obliged to defend	232.56663513183594
27421/28840	But dont fancy that I am going to take you on your bare	95.50725555419922
27422/28840	I am called Louis the Just Monsieur de Tréville and by and by by and by we will	105.63888549804688
27423/28840	Ah sire it is because I confide in that justice that I shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your	118.35672760009766
27424/28840	Wait then monsieur wait said the king I will not detain you	49.51253890991211
27425/28840	In fact fortune changed and as the king began to lose what he had won he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing Charlemagneif we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our	363.77618408203125
27426/28840	Ah I had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain	155.3278350830078
27427/28840	de Tréville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window Well monsieur continued he you say it is his Eminences Guards who have sought a quarrel with your Musketeers   Yes sire as they always	157.31707763671875
27428/28840	And how did the thing happen Let us see for you know my dear Captain a judge must hear both	352.8125
27429/28840	Good Lord In the most simple and natural manner	600.9142456054688
27430/28840	The party was to take place at	298.0106506347656
27431/28840	Ah ah You incline me to think so said the	237.3296356201172
27432/28840	There is no doubt they went thither to fight	260.6558532714844
27433/28840	I do not accuse them sire but I leave your Majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the Convent des Carm	307.8954162597656
27434/28840	Yes Tréville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in France two heads to	170.37979125976562
27435/28840	But all this will come to an end Tréville will come to an	72.62229919433594
27436/28840	You say then that the Guardsmen sought a quarrel with the Musketeers   I say that it is probable that things have fallen out so but I will not swear to it s	141.09820556640625
27437/28840	You know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes Louis	305.12652587890625
27438/28840	to be named the Just   You are right Tréville but they were not alone your Musket	163.2079315185547
27439/28840	Why this is a victory cried the king all radiant a complete victory   Yes sire as complete as that of the Bridge of	444.2885437011719
27440/28840	Four men one of them wounded and a youth say you   One hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that I will take the liberty of recommending him to your	203.7274169921875
27441/28840	How does he call himself   DArtagnan sire he is the son of one of my oldest friendsthe son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil	69.41942596435547
27442/28840	And you say this young man behaved himself well Tell me how Trévilleyou know how I delight in accounts of war and	2279.173828125
27443/28840	twisted his mustache proudly placing his hand upon his	5662.35888671875
27444/28840	Sire resumed Tréville as I told you Monsieur dArtagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a Musketeer he was dressed as a	44.311988830566406
27445/28840	The Guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they	186.44015502929688
27446/28840	So you may plainly see Tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked   That is true sire there can be no more doubt on that	122.5489273071289
27447/28840	They called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a Musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your Majesty and that therefore he would remain with Messieurs the Musket	177.33743286132812
27448/28840	Well he did remain with them and your Majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave Jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so	466.650146484375
27449/28840	He who wounded Jussac cried the king he a boy Tréville thats impossible   It is as I have the honor to relate it to your	216.19775390625
27450/28840	Jussac one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom   Well sire for once he found his	148.34970092773438
27451/28840	I will see this young man TrévilleI will see him and if anything can be donewell we will make it our	151.13157653808594
27452/28840	When will your Majesty deign to receive him   Tomorrow at midday Tré	143.4163055419922
27453/28840	Shall I bring him alone   No bring me all four	120.10729217529297
27454/28840	I wish to thank them all at	53.528343200683594
27455/28840	Devoted men are so rare Tréville by the back	181.91705322265625
27456/28840	It is useless to let the cardinal	172.2787322998047
27457/28840	You understand Trévillean edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after	868.9381713867188
27458/28840	But this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a	212.23318481445312
27459/28840	It is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinals Guardsmen against my three Musketeers and Monsieur dArtagn	228.53857421875
27460/28840	That is true said the king but never mind Tréville come still by the back	121.20587921142578
27461/28840	Tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of	289.2115783691406
27462/28840	That evening the three Musketeers were informed of the honor accorded	250.92369079589844
27463/28840	As they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited but DArtagnan with his Gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden	103.0357437133789
27464/28840	By eight oclock in the morning he was at the apartment of Ath	17.0373592376709
27465/28840	DArtagnan found the Musketeer dressed and ready to go	64.79508972167969
27466/28840	As the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with Porthos and Aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the	88.8655014038086
27467/28840	Athos invited DArtagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine oclock in the morning as it then scarcely was till	119.07553100585938
27468/28840	The two Musketeers were already there and were playing	301.40277099609375
27469/28840	DArtagnan remained therefore alone and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without	240.9213104248047
27470/28840	Unfortunately for DArtagnan among the spectators was one of his Eminences Guardsmen who still irritated by the defeat of his companions which had happened only the day before had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging	180.59519958496094
27471/28840	He believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor It is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is doubtless a Musketeer	246.40115356445312
27472/28840	DArtagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him and fixed his eyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made this insolent	226.37449645996094
27473/28840	_Pardieu_ resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman I have said what I have	140.94247436523438
27474/28840	And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied DArtagnan in a low voice I beg you to follow	59.616825103759766
27475/28840	And when asked the Guardsman with the same jeering	1610.03125
27476/28840	And you know who I am without doubt   I I am completely ignorant nor does it much disquiet	179.26475524902344
27477/28840	Youre in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so	160.78378295898438
27478/28840	What is your name   Bernajoux at your	375.2152099609375
27479/28840	Well then Monsieur Bernajoux said DArtagnan tranquilly I will wait for you at the	107.9511947631836
27480/28840	Do not hurry yourself monsieur lest it be observed that we go out	151.38552856445312
27481/28840	You must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the	170.62826538085938
27482/28840	Thats true said the Guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young	706.4656982421875
27483/28840	Indeed the name of Bernajoux was known to all the world DArtagnan alone excepted perhaps for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not rep	252.85491943359375
27484/28840	Porthos and Aramis were so engaged with their game and Athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the Guardsman of his Eminence stopped outside the	177.72718811035156
27485/28840	An instant after the Guardsman descended in his	1266.4395751953125
27486/28840	Never mind be content I will do my	157.64837646484375
27487/28840	On guard   But said he whom DArtagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the Abbey	186.39944458007812
27488/28840	What you say is full of sense replied DArtagnan but unfortunately I have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve	127.75438690185547
27489/28840	On guard then monsieur on guard   Bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him	274.5616149902344
27490/28840	In an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom thanks to his great youthfulness he hoped to	261.0749206542969
27491/28840	But DArtagnan had on the preceding day served his apprentices	86.67163848876953
27492/28840	Fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a	1027.9053955078125
27493/28840	He freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the	501.3245544433594
27494/28840	DArtagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but Bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon DArtagnans	467.67999267578125
27495/28840	As however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of	351.20281982421875
27496/28840	But Athos Porthos and Aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two Guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them	231.67672729492188
27497/28840	Thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the Red Duke as Aramis had called him often took part with the kings Musketeers in these quarrel	336.548828125
27498/28840	Of three Guardsmen of the company of	1175.72265625
27499/28840	Dessessart who were passing two came to the assistance of the four companions while the other ran toward the hôtel of	258.91986083984375
27500/28840	de Tréville crying To the rescue Musketeers To the rescue As usual this hôtel was full of soldiers of this company who hastened to the succor of their	365.52886962890625
27501/28840	The _mêlée_ became general but strength was on the side of the Musket	250.25680541992188
27502/28840	de la Trémouilles people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with	467.7466735839844
27503/28840	As to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad	44.02052688598633
27504/28840	Excitement was at its height among the Musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hôtel to punish the insolence of	407.4286193847656
27505/28840	de la Trémouilles domestics in daring to make a _sortie_ upon the kings Musket	1145.1485595703125
27506/28840	The proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven oclock	342.305419921875
27507/28840	DArtagnan and his companions remembered their audience and as they would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be lost they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates but the gates were too	253.85232543945312
27508/28840	Besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the hôtel of	203.2274627685547
27509/28840	de Tréville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh	105.36908721923828
27510/28840	Quick to the Louvre said he to the Louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the	65.54471588134766
27511/28840	We will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the affair of yesterday and the two will pass off	207.70260620117188
27512/28840	de Tréville accompanied by the four young fellows directed his course toward the Louvre but to the great astonishment of the captain of the Musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of	104.18038940429688
27513/28840	de Tréville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become	296.8782653808594
27514/28840	Had his Majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday   No your Excellency replied the valet de chambre the Master of the Hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a	179.2870635986328
27515/28840	At first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after	90.59984588623047
27516/28840	And the king has seen the cardinal asked	116.19303131103516
27517/28840	In all probability he has replied the valet for I saw the horses harnessed to his Eminences carriage this morning and when I asked where he was going they told me To	154.80795288085938
27518/28840	He is beforehand with us said	208.87107849121094
27519/28840	Gentlemen I will see the king this evening but as to you I do not advise you to risk doing	159.50067138671875
27520/28840	This advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute	161.13414001464844
27521/28840	de Tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for	416.1395568847656
27522/28840	de Tréville thought it best to be first in making the	225.24595642089844
27523/28840	He sent one of his servants to	117.51201629638672
27524/28840	de la Trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinals Guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making _sortie_ against the kings Musket	875.7073974609375
27525/28840	de la Trémouillealready prejudiced by his esquire whose relative as we already know Bernajoux wasreplied that it was neither for	6237.93994140625
27526/28840	de Tréville nor the Musketeers to complain but on the contrary for him whose people the Musketeers had assaulted and whose hôtel they had endeavored to	225.74142456054688
27527/28840	Now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion	595.8573608398438
27528/28840	de Tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it	1078.5072021484375
27529/28840	This was to go himself to	105.07556915283203
27530/28840	He repaired therefore immediately to his hôtel and caused himself to be	486.6509704589844
27531/28840	The two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least	604.1534423828125
27532/28840	Both were men of courage and honor and as	333.4155578613281
27533/28840	de la Trémouillea Protestant and seeing the king seldomwas of no party he did not in general carry any bias into his social	2418.18017578125
27534/28840	This time however his address although polite was cooler than	3151.959228515625
27535/28840	de Tréville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and I am come to endeavor to clear up this	96.24673461914062
27536/28840	de la Trémouille but I warn you that I am well informed and all the fault is with your Musket	201.2913360595703
27537/28840	You are too just and reasonable a man monsieur said Tréville not to accept the proposal I am about to make to	75.19097137451172
27538/28840	How is Monsieur Bernajoux your esquires relative   Why monsieur very ill indeed In addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous he has received another right through his lungs of which the doctor says bad	583.8884887695312
27539/28840	But has the wounded man retained his senses   Perfect	128.12774658203125
27540/28840	Does he talk   With difficulty but he can	212.8963623046875
27541/28840	Well monsieur let us go to	14.090985298156738
27542/28840	Let us adjure him in the name of the God before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the	249.07797241210938
27543/28840	I will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will	75.89747619628906
27544/28840	de la Trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to	458.5349426269531
27545/28840	Both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man	68.10669708251953
27546/28840	The latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost	148.91305541992188
27547/28840	de la Trémouille approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to	475.4945068359375
27548/28840	de Tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested	157.6737823486328
27549/28840	de la Trémouille to interrogate him	598.1381225585938
27550/28840	Placed between life and death as Bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had	348.661376953125
27551/28840	He wished Bernajoux a speedy convalescence took leave of	21877.533203125
27552/28840	de la Trémouille returned to his hôtel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at	625.2987670898438
27553/28840	de Tréville entertained good company wholly anticardinalist	27800.123046875
27554/28840	It may easily be understood therefore that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his Eminences Guardsmen had	1191.6146240234375
27555/28840	The king had not yet returned from	522.3861694335938
27556/28840	Our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his Majesty was	163.51321411132812
27557/28840	At his announcement DArtagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his	78.8310317993164
27558/28840	The coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his	290.80963134765625
27559/28840	His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must	100.65617370605469
27560/28840	He was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his	469.2635498046875
27561/28840	At the first glance DArtagnan judged that the mind of the king was storm	88.5444564819336
27562/28840	This disposition visible as it was in his Majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his	1132.5970458984375
27563/28840	In royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at	132.29281616210938
27564/28840	The three Musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step	235.5855712890625
27565/28840	DArtagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew Athos Porthos and Aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or lookingindeed as if he had never seen them	64.67736053466797
27566/28840	de Tréville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes after which his Majesty grumbling entered his	134.2933807373047
27567/28840	Matters go but badly said Athos smiling and we shall not be made Chevaliers of the Order this	142.51780700683594
27568/28840	de Tréville and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out return to my hôtel for it will be useless for you to wait for me	71.64208984375
27569/28840	The four young men waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour twenty minutes and seeing that	89.65186309814453
27570/28840	de Tréville did not return went away very uneasy as to what was going to	171.62474060058594
27571/28840	de Tréville entered the kings cabinet boldly and found his Majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his	273.81744384765625
27572/28840	This however did not prevent his asking with the greatest coolness after his Majestys	456.91046142578125
27573/28840	Bad monsieur bad replied the king I am	52.300811767578125
27574/28840	This was in fact the worst complaint of Louis	128.2547149658203
27575/28840	who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say Monsieur Soandso let us weary ourselves	310.65716552734375
27576/28840	How Your Majesty is bored Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today   A fine pleasure indeed monsieur Upon my soul everything degenerates and I dont know whether it is the game which leaves no scent or the dogs that have no	425.1749572753906
27577/28840	We started a stag of ten	1043.235595703125
27578/28840	We chased him for six hours and when he was near being takenwhen	392.8674011230469

27580/28840	I shall be obliged to give up hunting as I have given up haw	635.1475830078125
27581/28840	Ah I am an unfortunate king Monsieur de Tréville I had but one gerfalcon and he died day before	179.1457977294922
27582/28840	Indeed sire I wholly comprehend your	1356.3887939453125
27583/28840	The misfortune is great but I think you have still a good number of falcons sparrow hawks and tiercel	2334.392578125
27584/28840	And not a man to instruct	174.05001831054688

27587/28840	He knew the king of old and he knew that all these complaints were but a prefacea sort of excitation to encourage himselfand that he had now come to his point at	168.54205322265625
27588/28840	And in what have I been so unfortunate as to displease your Majesty asked	176.78416442871094

27590/28840	Is it thus you perform your charge monsieur continued the king without directly replying to de Trévilles	316.80169677734375
27591/28840	de Tréville calmly on the contrary I come to demand it of	91.84391784667969
27592/28840	Ah This is something new replied the	200.17832946777344
27593/28840	Tell me now can you deny all this   And who told you this fine story sire asked Tréville	135.5010528564453
27594/28840	Who has told me this fine story monsieur Who should it be but he who watches while I sleep who labors while I amuse myself who conducts everything at home and abroadin France as in Europe   Your Majesty probably refers to God said	657.4263916015625
27595/28840	de Tréville for I know no one except God who can be so far above your	178.77194213867188

27599/28840	You mean to say that he deceives me you mean to say that he betrays me You accuse him then Come speak avow freely that you accuse him   No sire but I say that he deceives	157.63011169433594
27600/28840	I say that he has hastily accused your Majestys Musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good	739.8046264648438
27601/28840	The accusation comes from Monsieur de la Trémouille from the duke	154.37008666992188

27607/28840	La Chesnaye said the king let someone go instantly and find Monsieur de la Trémouille I wish to speak with him this	369.2129821777344
27608/28840	Your Majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between Monsieur de la Trémouille and myself   Nobody by the faith of a	109.5675048828125

27617/28840	Till then God preserve your Majesty   However ill the king might sleep	895.7302856445312
27618/28840	He had ordered his three Musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the	125.9249038696289
27619/28840	He took them with him without encouraging them or promising them anything and without concealing from them that their luck and even his own depended upon the cast of the	615.5398559570312
27620/28840	Arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to	195.1473846435547

27622/28840	On arriving at the kings private antechamber	200.36416625976562
27623/28840	de Tréville found La Chesnaye who informed him that they had not been able to find	713.9893188476562
27624/28840	de la Trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel that he returned too late to present himself at the Louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the	143.0353546142578
27625/28840	de Tréville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between	864.110107421875
27626/28840	In fact ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the kings closet opened and	103.19884490966797
27627/28840	The duke came straight up to him and said Monsieur de Tréville his Majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my hô	118.79854583740234

27631/28840	I find that I have not been mistaken and I thank you that there is still one man in France of whom may be said without disappointment what I have said of	79.544189453125
27632/28840	Tell him all this for me for these are things which a king cannot say for	209.15911865234375
27633/28840	Thanks sire thanks said the duke but your Majesty may be assured that it is not thoseI do not speak of Monsieur de Trévillewhom your Majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to	107.06648254394531
27634/28840	Ah You have heard what I said So much the better Duke so much the better said the king advancing toward the	90.80693054199219
27635/28840	Where are your Musketeers I told you the day before yesterday to bring them with you why have you not done so   They are below sire and with your permission La Chesnaye will bid them come	319.44659423828125
27636/28840	Yes yes let them come up	202.3782196044922
27637/28840	It is nearly eight oclock and at nine I expect a	205.4878692626953
27638/28840	At the moment he opened the door the three Musketeers and DArtagnan conducted by La Chesnaye appeared at the top of the	177.88470458984375
27639/28840	Come in my braves said the king come in I am going to scold	262.3448181152344
27640/28840	The Musketeers advanced bowing DArtagnan following closely behind	286.87774658203125
27641/28840	One now and then I dont say much about but seven in two days I repeat it is too many it is far too many   Therefore sire your Majesty sees that they are come quite contrite and repentant to offer you their	423.51495361328125
27642/28840	Quite contrite and repentant Hem said the	11135.1337890625
27643/28840	I place no confidence in their hypocritical	1440.8470458984375
27644/28840	In particular there is one yonder of a Gascon	121.48876953125
27645/28840	DArtagnan who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most deprecating	312.8231201171875
27646/28840	Why you told me he was a young man This is a boy Tréville a mere boy Do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at Jussac   And those two equally fine thrusts at Bernaj	444.6820983886719
27647/28840	Truly   Without reckoning said Athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of Cahusac I should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your	157.41934204101562
27648/28840	Why he is a very devil this Béarnais _Ventresaintgris_ Monsieur de Tréville as the king my father would have	493.8577880859375
27649/28840	But at this sort of work many doublets must be slashed and many swords	1696.128173828125
27650/28840	Which is to say that the Gascons made a king of me myself seeing that I am my fathers son is it not Tréville Well happily I dont say nay to	147.13291931152344
27651/28840	La Chesnaye go and see if by rummaging all my pockets you can find forty pistoles and if you can find them bring them to	410.0181884765625

27653/28840	This is all very well murmured the king yes this is just the account the duke gave me of the	96.18960571289062
27654/28840	Poor cardinal Seven men in two days and those of his very best But thats quite enough gentlemen please to understand thats	1151.078125
27655/28840	You have taken your revenge for the Rue Férou and even exceeded it you ought to be	231.3437957763672
27656/28840	If your Majesty is so said Tréville we	194.99093627929688
27657/28840	Oh yes I am added the king taking a handful of gold from La Chesnaye and putting it into the hand of DArtagn	256.968505859375
27658/28840	Here said he is a proof of my	65.13510131835938
27659/28840	At this epoch the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did not	653.5967407226562
27660/28840	A gentleman received from hand to hand money from the king and was not the least in the world	180.32553100585938
27661/28840	DArtagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scrupleon the contrary thanking his Majesty	315.84088134765625
27662/28840	There said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire for as I told you I expect someone at	135.08126831054688
27663/28840	I may continue to rely upon it may I not   Oh sire cried the four companions with one voice we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your Majestys	174.1632537841797
27664/28840	Well well but keep whole that will be better and you will be more useful to	131.04298400878906
27665/28840	Ah _pardieu_ Tréville I enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will	141.4201202392578
27666/28840	He will be furious but I dont	169.9136962890625
27667/28840	The king waved his hand to Tréville who left him and rejoined the Musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with DArtagn	126.9035873413086
27668/28840	The cardinal as his Majesty had said was really furious so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the kings gaming	1175.26806640625
27669/28840	The repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at	307.121337890625
27670/28840	The repast had been ordered by Athos and the lackey furnished by Porth	51.138450622558594
27671/28840	He was a Picard whom the glorious Musketeer had picked up on the Bridge Tournelle making rings and plashing in the	1939.98681640625
27672/28840	Porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization and he had brought him away without any other	731.9838256835938
27673/28840	The noble carriage of this gentleman for whom he believed himself to be engaged had won Planchetthat was the name of the	204.7961883544922
27674/28840	Nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a Crœs	244.20738220214844
27675/28840	He preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence but when in the evening he made his masters bed the chimeras of Planchet faded	455.27105712890625
27676/28840	The bed was the only one in the apartment which consisted of an antechamber and a	60.5209846496582
27677/28840	Planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of DArtagnan and which DArtagnan from that time made shift to do	85.7549819946289
27678/28840	Athos on his part had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion and who was named Grim	273.994140625
27679/28840	He was very taciturn this worthy sign	1240.9481201171875
27680/28840	Be it understood we are speaking of Ath	96.94416809082031
27681/28840	During the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions Porthos and Aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him	95.28972625732422
27682/28840	His words were brief and expressive conveying all that was meant and no more no embellishments no embroidery no arabes	544.7894287109375
27683/28840	His conversation was a matter of fact without a single	476.5851745605469
27684/28840	Although Athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a	117.18148803710938
27685/28840	He certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to	165.97409057617188
27686/28840	His reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of	294.3163757324219
27687/28840	He had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his	150.66574096679688
27688/28840	He never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary	248.04588317871094
27689/28840	Sometimes Grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the	482.74530029296875
27690/28840	Athos then shrugged his shoulders and without putting himself in a passion thrashed Grim	452.263916015625
27691/28840	On these days he spoke a	165.6648406982422
27692/28840	Porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of Ath	108.20867156982422
27693/28840	He not only talked much but he talked loudly little caring we must render him that justice whether anybody listened to him or	952.5255737304688
27694/28840	He talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself	271.57452392578125
27695/28840	He spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his	1377.5255126953125
27696/28840	He had not so noble an air as Athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid	311.7955627441406
27697/28840	But with his simple Musketeers uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot Athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious Porthos to the second	166.9285125732422
27698/28840	Porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of	135.2351837158203
27699/28840	An old proverb says Like master like	6554.17822265625
27700/28840	Let us pass then from the valet of Athos to the valet of Porthos from Grimaud to Mousqu	41.219478607177734
27701/28840	Mousqueton was a Norman whose pacific name of Boniface his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of Mousqu	1065.4757080078125
27702/28840	He had entered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner but he claimed two hours a day to himself consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other	403.0110168457031
27703/28840	Porthos agreed to the bargain the thing suited him wonderfully	1213.654541015625
27704/28840	As for Aramis of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the charactera character which like that of his companions we shall be able to follow in its developmenthis lackey was called Baz	244.98719787597656
27705/28840	Thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a church	651.1348876953125
27706/28840	He was a Berrichon thirtyfive or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but	4385.15234375
27707/28840	For the rest he was dumb blind and deaf and of unimpeachable	6947.6318359375
27708/28840	And now that we are acquainted superficially at least with the masters and the valets let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of	475.8163146972656
27709/28840	Athos dwelt in the Rue Férou within two steps of the	178.12423706054688
27710/28840	His apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at	607.9625854492188
27711/28840	It had long been an object of ambition for Porth	66.7881851196289
27712/28840	Porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this	80.27108001708984
27713/28840	One day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of Ath	77.25106048583984
27714/28840	In addition to the sword there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of Henry	345.3600158691406
27715/28840	dressed with the greatest elegance and who wore the Order of the Holy Ghost and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with Athos certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble a knight of the Order of the King was his	675.5365600585938
27716/28840	Besides these a casket of magnificent goldwork with the same arms as the sword and the portrait formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece and assorted badly with the rest of the	285.6658630371094
27717/28840	Athos always carried the key of this coffer about him but he one day opened it before Porthos and Porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and paperslove letters and family papers no	286.0700378417969
27718/28840	Porthos lived in an apartment large in size and of very sumptuous appearance in the Rue du VieuxColomb	779.2584838867188
27719/28840	With regard to DArtagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey Master Planc	67.02877044677734
27720/28840	He addressed himself then to Porthos to gain information respecting Athos and Aramis and to Aramis in order to learn something of Porth	40.98756408691406
27721/28840	Unfortunately Porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed	229.76161193847656
27722/28840	It was said Athos had met with great crosses in love and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant	189.56661987304688
27723/28840	What could this treachery be All the world was ignorant of	562.7109375
27724/28840	As to Porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily	133.3725128173828
27725/28840	Vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a	237.0891571044922
27726/28840	The only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of	331.95147705078125
27727/28840	And you my dear companion said he you speak of the baronesses countesses and princesses of others   _Pardieu_ I spoke of them because Porthos talked of them himself because he had paraded all these fine things before	172.29794311523438
27728/28840	But be assured my dear Monsieur dArtagnan that if I had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than	55.26555633544922
27729/28840	The handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my	57.177650451660156
27730/28840	I was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he	103.47671508789062
27731/28840	As for myself I neither have nor desire to have a mistress following in that respect the very judicious example of Athos who has none any more than I	138.25390625
27732/28840	But what the devil You are not a priest you are a Musketeer   A Musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a Musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe	153.12619018554688
27733/28840	Athos and Porthos dragged me into this to occupy	176.74607849121094
27734/28840	I had at the moment of being ordained a little difficulty withBut that would not interest you and I am taking up your valuable	373.7825012207031
27735/28840	Not at all it interests me very much cried DArtagnan and at this moment I have absolutely nothing to	62.799068450927734
27736/28840	Yes but I have my breviary to repeat answered Aramis then some verses to compose which Madame dAiguillon begged of	342.06378173828125
27737/28840	Then I must go to the Rue	72.20674133300781
27738/28840	Honoré in order to purchase some rouge for Madame de Chevre	51.75960159301758
27739/28840	So you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry I am very much in a	26.43747901916504
27740/28840	Aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of	72.42407989501953
27741/28840	Notwithstanding all the pains he took DArtagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three newmade	392.60015869140625
27742/28840	He formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the	561.1765747070312
27743/28840	In the meanwhile he looked upon Athos as an Achilles Porthos as an Ajax and Aramis as a	412.6668701171875
27744/28840	As to the rest the life of the four young friends was joyous	135.28916931152344
27745/28840	Athos played and that as a rule	1411.0225830078125
27746/28840	Nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six oclock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding	225.40798950195312
27747/28840	On the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious if he lost he disappeared completely for several days after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person but with money in his	514.5559692382812
27748/28840	He was the worst Musketeer and the most unconvivial companion	1391.9608154296875
27749/28840	He had always something or other to	247.1450653076172
27750/28840	At other times he would return home to write a treatise and requested his friends not to disturb	225.95616149902344
27751/28840	At this Athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and Porthos would drink swearing that Aramis would never be anything but a village _curé	256.906494140625

27755/28840	were consumed or nearly sohe commenced complaints which Athos thought nauseous Porthos indecent and Aramis	1812.5491943359375
27756/28840	Athos counseled DArtagnan to dismiss the fellow Porthos was of the opinion that he should give him a good thrashing first and Aramis contended that a master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to	254.751953125
27757/28840	It is with valets as with wives they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to	222.3665008544922
27758/28840	DArtagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash Planchet provisionally which he did with the conscientiousness that DArtagnan carried into	251.3079376220703
27759/28840	After having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his	458.7724914550781

27761/28840	Your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and I am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you	184.01589965820312
27762/28840	This manner of acting roused much respect for DArtagnans policy among the Musket	336.8305969238281
27763/28840	Planchet was equally seized with admiration and said no more about going	237.50872802734375

27776/28840	DArtagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his	82.64045715332031
27777/28840	Upon this promise DArtagnan withdrew and the next day he began	81.92265319824219
27778/28840	Then it became the turn of Athos Porthos and Aramis to mount guard with DArtagnan when he was on	41.996952056884766
27779/28840	le Chevalier Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted DArtagn	629.7713623046875
27780/28840	CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE     In the meantime the forty pistoles of King Louis	7069.83984375
27781/28840	like all other things of this world after having had a beginning had an end and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat	249.65252685546875
27782/28840	At first Athos supported the association for a time with his own	402.7207336425781
27783/28840	Porthos succeeded him and thanks to one of those disappearances to which he was accustomed he was able to provide for the wants of all for a	144.15548706054688
27784/28840	At last it became Aramiss turn who performed it with a good grace and who succeededas he said by selling some theological booksin procuring a few pist	724.0498657226562
27785/28840	Then as they had been accustomed to do they had recourse to	65.13414001464844
27786/28840	de Tréville who made some advances on their pay but these advances could not go far with three Musketeers who were already much in arrears and a Guardsman who as yet had no pay at	670.2785034179688
27787/28840	At length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten pistoles with which Porthos went to the gaming	129.36476135253906
27788/28840	Unfortunately he was in a bad vein he lost all together with twentyfive pistoles for which he had given his	140.79718017578125
27789/28840	Athos was invited four times and each time took his friends and their lackeys with	142.77696228027344
27790/28840	Porthos had six occasions and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them Aramis had eight of	186.73297119140625
27791/28840	He was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought	211.6935577392578
27792/28840	As to DArtagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the	260.1936340332031
27793/28840	He fancied himself a burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month and he set his mind actively to	798.685791015625
27794/28840	He reflected that this coalition of four young brave enterprising and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks fencing lessons and practical jokes more or less	1703.0263671875
27795/28840	The only thing that astonished DArtagnan was that his friends had never thought of	61.08940887451172
27796/28840	DArtagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open	29.37029266357422
27797/28840	From this phrase DArtagnan awakened Planchet the reader must not suppose it was night or that day was hardly	193.52923583984375
27798/28840	Planchet two hours before had asked his master for some dinner and he had answered him with the proverb He who sleeps d	290.7447509765625
27799/28840	A man was introduced of simple mien who had the appearance of a trades	381.755859375
27800/28840	Planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to DArtagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with	116.6259994506836
27801/28840	DArtagnan dismissed Planchet and requested his visitor to be	64.69534301757812
27802/28840	There was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which DArtagnan bowed as a sign that he	53.202308654785156
27803/28840	I have heard Monsieur dArtagnan spoken of as a very brave young man said the citizen and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to	133.60809326171875
27804/28840	Speak monsieur speak said DArtagnan who instinctively scented something	167.4773712158203
27805/28840	The citizen made a fresh pause and continued I have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or	357.78948974609375
27806/28840	I was induced to marry her about three years ago although she had but very little dowry because Monsieur Laporte the queens cloak bearer is her godfather and befriends	336.7588195800781
27807/28840	Well resumed the citizen well monsieur my wife was abducted yesterday morning as she was coming out of her work	340.9141540527344
27808/28840	And by whom was your wife abducted   I know nothing surely monsieur but I suspect	229.0734100341797
27809/28840	And who is the person whom you suspect   A man who has pursued her a long	70.93436431884766
27810/28840	The devil   But allow me to tell you monsieur continued the citizen that I am convinced that there is less love than politics in all	54.85783386230469
27811/28840	Less love than politics replied DArtagnan with a reflective air and what do you suspect   I do not know whether I ought to tell you what I	48.39908218383789
27812/28840	Monsieur I beg you to observe that I ask you absolutely	62.35524368286133
27813/28840	It is you who have come to	32.77642059326172
27814/28840	It is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in	53.73155212402344
27815/28840	Act then as you think proper there is still time to	186.2936248779297
27816/28840	No monsieur no you appear to be an honest young man and I will have confidence in	32.929847717285156
27817/28840	I believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than	150.93914794921875
27818/28840	Ah ah Can it be on account of the amours of Madame de BoisTracy said DArtagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court	223.61578369140625
27819/28840	Of Madame dAiguillon   Still	1749.5091552734375
27820/28840	Of Madame de Chevreuse   Higher much	238.85296630859375
27821/28840	Yes monsieur replied the terrified citizen in a tone so low that he was scarcely	58.51276397705078
27822/28840	And with whom   With whom can it be if not the Duke of   The Duke of   Yes monsieur replied the citizen giving a still fainter intonation to his	115.28836822509766
27823/28840	But how do you know all this   How do I know it   Yes how do you know it No halfconfidence oryou understand   I know it from my wife monsieurfrom my wife	73.95926666259766
27824/28840	Who learns it from whom   From Monsieur Laport	46.59961700439453
27825/28840	Ah ah It begins to develop itself said DArtagn	250.0864715576172
27826/28840	Now my wife came home four days ago monsie	146.44143676757812

27828/28840	The cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than	461.6680908203125
27829/28840	He cannot pardon her the history of the Sar	1980.8699951171875
27830/28840	You know the history of the Saraband   _Pardieu_ Know it replied DArtagnan who knew nothing about it but who wished to appear to know everything that was going	66.02758026123047
27831/28840	So that now it is no longer hatred but	311.7461853027344
27832/28840	Indeed   And the queen believes   Well what does the queen believe   She believes that someone has written to the Duke of Buckingham in her	85.01240539550781
27833/28840	In the queens name   Yes to make him come to Paris and when once come to Paris to draw him into some sn	72.25775146484375
27834/28840	That is likely said DArtagnan but the man who has abducted herdo you know him   I have told you that I believe I know	50.9913444519043
27835/28840	His name   I do not know that what I do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal his evil	46.483482360839844
27836/28840	But you have seen him   Yes my wife pointed him out to me one	57.42287063598633
27837/28840	Has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him   Oh certainly he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his	490.519287109375
27838/28840	A scar on his temple cried DArtagnan and with that white teeth a piercing eye dark complexion black hair and haughty carriagewhy thats my man of Me	281.0789794921875
27839/28840	He is your man do you say   Yes yes but that has nothing to do with	31.22972297668457
27840/28840	On the contrary that simplifies the matter	9402.0556640625
27841/28840	If your man is mine with one blow I shall obtain two revenges thats all but where to find this man   I know	219.6114959716797

27844/28840	The devil The devil murmured DArtagnan all this is vague	125.59634399414062
27845/28840	From whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife   From Monsieur Laport	50.640193939208984
27846/28840	Did he give you any details   He knew none	136.53541564941406
27847/28840	And you have learned nothing from any other quarter   Yes I have received   What   I fear I am committing a great impr	87.98611450195312
27848/28840	You always come back to that but I must make you see this time that it is too late to	57.25398635864258
27849/28840	I do not retreat _mordieu_ cried the citizen swearing in order to rouse his	399.2619934082031
27850/28840	Besides by the faith of Bonacieux   You call yourself Bonacieux interrupted DArtagn	58.34189224243164
27851/28840	You said then by the word of Bonacie	94.77367401123047
27852/28840	Pardon me for interrupting you but it appears to me that that name is familiar to	173.02923583984375
27853/28840	Ah ah said DArtagnan half rising and bowing you are my landlord   Yes monsieur	44.30760192871094
27854/28840	And as it is three months since you have been here and though distracted as you must be in your important occupations you have forgotten to pay me my rentas I say I have not tormented you a single instant I thought you would appreciate my delic	198.49375915527344
27855/28840	Finish then what you were about to	38.01021194458008
27856/28840	The citizen took a paper from his pocket and presented it to DArtagn	27.450349807739258
27857/28840	DArtagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read	51.42198944091797
27858/28840	Do not seek your wife read DArtagnan she will be restored to you when there is no longer occasion for	69.71844482421875
27859/28840	If you make a single step to find her you are	129.31346130371094
27860/28840	Thats pretty positive continued DArtagnan but after all it is but a	176.2505340576172
27861/28840	I am not a fighting man at all monsieur and I am afraid of the Bast	50.52942657470703
27862/28840	I have no greater regard for the Bastille than	445.7499694824219
27863/28840	If it were nothing but a sword thrust why then   I have counted upon you on this occasion monsie	78.60720825195312
27864/28840	And then I have thought that considering three months lodging about which I have said nothing   Yes yes you have already given me that reason and I find it	119.81841278076172
27865/28840	Whom do I see yonder   Where   In the street facing your window in the embrasure of that doora man wrapped in a	152.4728546142578
27866/28840	It is he cried DArtagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his	51.501861572265625
27867/28840	Ah this time cried DArtagnan springing to his sword this time he will not escape me   Drawing his sword from its scabbard he rushed out of the	67.47413635253906
27868/28840	On the staircase he met Athos and Porthos who were coming to see	40.37197494506836
27869/28840	They separated and DArtagnan rushed between them like a	88.21961212158203
27870/28840	Pah Where are you going cried the two Musketeers in a	196.73121643066406
27871/28840	The man of Meung replied DArtagnan and	146.45310974121094
27872/28840	DArtagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important miss	115.09381103515625
27873/28840	The opinion of Athos was that DArtagnan had lost his letter in the skirm	58.63901138305664
27874/28840	A gentleman in his opinionand according to DArtagnans portrait of him the stranger must be a gentlemanwould be incapable of the baseness of stealing a	303.9320068359375
27875/28840	Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of DArtagnan and his yellow	77.53211212158203
27876/28840	Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom	368.5758361816406
27877/28840	They understood then from the few words which escaped from DArtagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him DArtagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their	90.58714294433594

27879/28840	DARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF     As Athos and Porthos had foreseen at the expiration of a half hour DArtagnan	1017.2964477539062
27880/28840	He had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by	107.63822174072266
27881/28840	DArtagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought	222.5948028564453
27882/28840	While DArtagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors Aramis had joined his companions so that on returning home DArtagnan found the reunion	168.60733032226562

27885/28840	Do you believe in apparitions asked Athos of Porth	101.42498779296875
27886/28840	I never believe in anything I have not seen and as I never have seen apparitions I dont believe in	153.80514526367188
27887/28840	The Bible said Aramis makes our belief in them a law the ghost of Samuel appeared to Saul and it is an article of faith that I should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon Porth	337.4982604980469
27888/28840	At all events man or devil body or shadow illusion or reality this man is born for my damnation for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair gentlemenan affair by which there were a hundred pistoles and perhaps more to be	999.69921875
27889/28840	How is that cried Porthos and Aramis in a	27.865066528320312
27890/28840	As to Athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating DArtagnan by a	115.86399841308594
27891/28840	Ah ah You have credit with your landlord then asked Porth	155.7906951904297
27892/28840	Yes replied DArtagnan from this very day and mind if the wine is bad we will send him to find	104.0390625
27893/28840	We must use and not abuse said Aramis sentent	531.8811645507812
27894/28840	I always said that DArtagnan had the longest head of the four said Athos who having uttered his opinion to which DArtagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed	142.02711486816406
27895/28840	But come what is this about asked Porth	57.87443542480469
27896/28840	Yes said Aramis impart it to us my dear friend unless the honor of any lady be hazarded by this confidence in that case you would do better to keep it to	200.3836669921875
27897/28840	Be satisfied replied DArtagnan the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what I have to	42.411865234375
27898/28840	He then related to his friends word for word all that had passed between him and his host and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the Jolly	294.9574279785156
27899/28840	Your affair is not bad said Athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good	144.00076293945312
27900/28840	Then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four	340.4200134277344
27901/28840	But observe cried DArtagnan that there is a woman in the affaira woman carried off a woman who is doubtless threatened tortured perhaps and all because she is faithful to her	193.65634155273438
27902/28840	You grow a little too warm in my opinion about the fate of Madame Bonacie	153.5096435546875

27904/28840	At this speech of Aramis the brow of Athos became clouded and he bit his	93.45894622802734
27905/28840	It is not Madame Bonacieux about whom I am anxious cried DArtagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the	148.92022705078125
27906/28840	Why does she love what we hate most in the world the Spaniards and the English   Spain is her country replied DArtagnan and it is very natural that she should love the Spanish who are the children of the same soil as	140.57398986816406
27907/28840	As to the second reproach I have heard it said that she does not love the English but an English	59.1038818359375
27908/28840	Well and by my faith said Athos it must be acknowledged that this Englishman is worthy of being	84.34412384033203
27909/28840	I never saw a man with a nobler air than	373.5886535644531

27915/28840	Go on while I endeavor to recall	812.3766479492188
27916/28840	And now I am convinced said DArtagnan that this abduction of the queens woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of Buckingham in	81.26268768310547

27920/28840	Yesterday I was at the house of a doctor of theology whom I sometimes consult about my	427.952392578125
27921/28840	He resides in a quiet quarter continued Aramis his tastes and his profession require	1013.8310546875
27922/28840	Now at the moment when I left his house   Here Aramis	43.46508026123047
27923/28840	This doctor has a niece continued Aram	958.8425903320312
27924/28840	Ah he has a niece interrupted Porth	218.51905822753906
27925/28840	Ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied Aramis you shall know	55.39678955078125
27926/28840	We believe like Mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said Ath	3538.281005859375
27927/28840	This niece comes sometimes to see her uncle and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that I was and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her	170.7787628173828
27928/28840	Ah She has a carriage then this niece of the doctor interrupted Porthos one of whose faults was a great looseness of	803.5023193359375
27929/28840	A nice acquaintance my friend   Porthos replied Aramis I have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet and that is injurious to you among the	111.87284851074219
27930/28840	Gentlemen gentlemen cried DArtagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is	109.06371307373047
27931/28840	Let us try not to jest if we	220.0873260498047
27932/28840	All at once a tall dark gentlemanjust like yours DArtagn	306.96630859375
27933/28840	will you enter this carriage and that without offering the least resistance without making the least noise   He took you for Buckingham cried DArtagn	125.93793487548828
27934/28840	He took her for the queen said DArtagn	20.604806900024414
27935/28840	The Gascon is the devil cried Athos nothing escapes	193.69309997558594
27936/28840	The fact is said Porthos Aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a Musketeer   I wore an enormous cloak said Aram	78.36443328857422
27937/28840	In the month of July The devil said Porth	71.88823699951172
27938/28840	Is the doctor afraid that you may be recognized   I can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person but the face   I had a large hat said Aram	71.87545013427734
27939/28840	Oh good lord cried Porthos what precautions for the study of theology   Gentlemen gentlemen said DArtagnan do not let us lose our time in j	71.71742248535156
27940/28840	Let us separate and let us seek the mercers wifethat is the key of the	250.02076721191406
27941/28840	A woman of such inferior condition Can you believe so said Porthos protruding his lips with	589.4078979492188
27942/28840	She is goddaughter to Laporte the confidential valet of the	708.9257202148438
27943/28840	Have I not told you so gentlemen Besides it has perhaps been her Majestys calculation to seek on this occasion for support so	1156.113525390625
27944/28840	High heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is long	4101.07373046875
27945/28840	Well said Porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good	130.8666534423828
27946/28840	Thats useless said DArtagnan for I believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another	97.72427368164062
27947/28840	At this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was	225.1551055908203
27948/28840	Save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me cried	300.09173583984375
27949/28840	There are four men come to arrest	274.0371398925781
27950/28840	Save me Save me   Porthos and Aramis	49.31591033935547
27951/28840	A moment cried DArtagnan making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their halfdrawn	163.45849609375
27952/28840	It is not courage that is needed it is prud	139.9595947265625
27953/28840	And yet cried Porthos we will not leave   You will leave DArtagnan to act as he thinks proper said Ath	44.018272399902344
27954/28840	He has I repeat the longest head of the four and for my part I declare that I will obey	198.4699249267578
27955/28840	At this moment the four Guards appeared at the door of the antechamber but seeing four Musketeers standing and their swords by their sides they hesitated about going	399.6069030761719
27956/28840	Come in gentlemen come in called DArtagnan you are here in my apartment and we are all faithful servants of the king and	67.39917755126953
27957/28840	Then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received asked one who appeared to be the leader of the	208.1552276611328
27958/28840	On the contrary gentlemen we would assist you if it were	148.95594787597656
27959/28840	Silence   But you promised me whispered the poor mer	428.32025146484375
27960/28840	We can only save you by being free ourselves replied DArtagnan in a rapid low tone and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with	108.39990997314453
27961/28840	It seems nevertheless   Come gentlemen come said DArtagnan aloud I have no motive for defending Monsie	79.63678741455078
27962/28840	I saw him today for the first time and he can tell you on what occasion he came to demand the rent of my	97.82479095458984
27963/28840	And DArtagnan pushed the halfstupefied mercer among the Guards saying to him You are a shabby old fellow my	396.3234558105469
27964/28840	You come to demand money of meof a Musketeer To prison with him Gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible that will give me time to pay	294.6224670410156
27965/28840	The officers were full of thanks and took away their	449.85052490234375
27966/28840	As they were going down DArtagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their	49.88816833496094
27967/28840	May I not drink to your health and you to mine said DArtagnan filling two glasses with the Beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of	215.6255340576172
27968/28840	That will do me great honor said the leader of the posse and I accept	679.6823120117188
27969/28840	Then to yours monsieurwhat is your name   Boisren	123.3333511352539
27970/28840	To yours my gentlemen What is your name in your turn if you please   DArtagn	41.05705642700195
27971/28840	And above all others cried DArtagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm to that of the king and the	70.91565704345703
27972/28840	The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of DArtagnan if the wine had been bad but the wine was good and he was	142.45285034179688
27973/28840	What diabolical villainy you have performed here said Porthos when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves	103.50321197509766
27974/28840	DArtagnan you are a great man and when you occupy Monsieur de Trévilles place I will come and ask your influence to secure me an ab	66.22531127929688
27975/28840	Well I am in a maze said Porthos do _you_ approve of what DArtagnan has done   _Parbleu_ Indeed I do said Athos I not only approve of what he has done but I congratulate him upon	79.44943237304688
27976/28840	And now gentlemen said DArtagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to Porthos All for one one for allthat is our motto is it not   And yet said Porth	81.370361328125
27977/28840	Hold out your hand and swear cried Athos and Aramis at	61.02206802368164
27978/28840	Overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless Porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by DArtagnan   All for one one for	156.251220703125
27979/28840	Thats well Now let us everyone retire to his own home said DArtagnan as if he had done nothing but command all his life and attention For from this moment we are at feud with the	192.68283081054688
27980/28840	As perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de Jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is a mouset	184.84732055664062
27981/28840	When in a house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held	481.7431640625
27982/28840	Four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first	50.977752685546875
27983/28840	The door is opened to all who	721.5015869140625
27984/28840	It is closed after them and they are arrested so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the _habitués_ of the	179.72796630859375
27985/28840	Bonacieux then became a mousetrap and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinals	267.3399353027344
27986/28840	It must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor in which DArtagnan lodged those who called on him were exempted from this	291.5584411621094
27987/28840	Besides nobody came thither but the three Musketeers they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered	512.5452270507812
27988/28840	Athos had even gone so far as to question	217.9912109375
27989/28840	de Trévillea thing which considering the habitual reticence of the worthy Musketeer had very much astonished his	600.7128295898438
27990/28840	de Tréville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queens eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tear	217.80418395996094
27991/28840	But this last circumstance was not striking as the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept	283.49090576171875
27992/28840	de Tréville requested Athos whatever might happen to be observant of his duty to the king but particularly to the queen begging him to convey his desires to his	250.51815795898438
27993/28840	As to DArtagnan he did not budge from his	190.0093231201172
27994/28840	He converted his chamber into an observ	1973.587646484375
27995/28840	From his windows he saw all the visitors who were	247.17088317871094
27996/28840	Then having removed a plank from his floor and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath in which the interrogatories were made he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the	327.6607666015625
27997/28840	Now what is it they want to know Why they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris and if he has had or is likely to have an interview with the	77.85977172851562
27998/28840	DArtagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in	207.6402130126953
27999/28840	In the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise DArtagnans	455.2552185058594
28000/28840	On the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux as Athos had just left DArtagnan to report at	50.392879486083984
28001/28840	de Trévilles as nine oclock had just struck and as Planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task a knocking was heard at the street	107.06331634521484
28002/28840	The door was instantly opened and shut someone was taken in the mouset	376.9587097167969
28003/28840	DArtagnan flew to his hole laid himself down on the floor at full length and	108.1325912475586
28004/28840	Cries were soon heard and then moans which someone appeared to be endeavoring to st	217.52001953125
28005/28840	It seems like a woman They search her she resists they use forcethe scoundrels   In spite of his prudence DArtagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on	284.6610107421875
28006/28840	But I tell you that I am the mistress of the house gentlemen I tell you I am Madame Bonacieux I tell you I belong to the queen cried the unfortunate	52.1632194519043
28007/28840	Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for   The voice became more and more indistinct a tumultuous movement shook the	311.51617431640625
28008/28840	The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four	364.6231384277344
28009/28840	Pardon gentlemenpar murmured the voice which could now only be heard in inarticulate	254.292236328125
28010/28840	They are binding her they are going to drag her away cried DArtagnan to himself springing up from the	168.19627380371094
28011/28840	My sword Good it is by my side Planchet   Monsie	59.87333679199219
28012/28840	Run and seek Athos Porthos and Aram	17.242401123046875
28013/28840	One of the three will certainly be at home perhaps all	201.92111206054688
28014/28840	Tell them to take arms to come here and to run Ah I remember Athos is at Monsieur de Trév	129.59307861328125
28015/28840	But where are you going monsieur where are you going   I am going down by the window in order to be there the sooner cried DArtagn	24.52382469177246
28016/28840	You put back the boards sweep the floor go out at the door and run as I told	173.76292419433594
28017/28840	Oh monsieur Monsieur You will kill yourself cried Planc	28.90715789794922
28018/28840	Hold your tongue stupid fellow said DArtagnan and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest	347.183837890625
28019/28840	Bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after	228.72915649414062
28020/28840	Then those who dwelt in Bonacieuxs unfortunate house together with the nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping of feet clashing of swords and breaking of	1056.131103515625
28021/28840	DArtagnan was conquerorwithout much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for forms	458.6221923828125
28022/28840	It is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and crockery but two or three scratches made by the Gascons blade terrified	421.905029296875
28023/28840	Ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and DArtagnan remained master of the field of	61.58122634887695
28024/28840	The neighbors who had opened their windows with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of Paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black fleetheir instinct telling them that for the time all was	400.9366455078125
28025/28840	Besides it began to grow late and then as today people went to bed early in the quarter of the	196.41796875
28026/28840	Bonacieux DArtagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left halffainting upon an arm	85.56304931640625
28027/28840	DArtagnan examined her with a rapid	32.01102066040039
28028/28840	She was a charming woman of twentyfive or twentysix years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and op	329.256591796875
28029/28840	There however ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of	374.4043273925781
28030/28840	The hands were white but without delicacy the feet did not bespeak the woman of	1605.3388671875
28031/28840	Happily DArtagnan was not yet acquainted with such nic	267.18408203125
28032/28840	From that time DArtagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them and he therefore placed in the pocket of M	128.58985900878906

28035/28840	She extended her hands to him with a	41.759765625
28036/28840	Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the	80.82453918457031
28037/28840	Ah monsieur said she you have saved me permit me to thank	22.970897674560547
28038/28840	Madame said DArtagnan I have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place you owe me no	49.6497917175293
28039/28840	Oh yes monsieur oh yes and I hope to prove to you that you have not served an ing	118.42671966552734
28040/28840	My husband in the Bastille cried M	4653.20947265625
28041/28840	Oh my God What has he done Poor dear man he is innocence itself   And something like a faint smile lighted the stillterrified features of the young	387.760986328125
28042/28840	What has he done madame said DArtagn	16.5122127532959
28043/28840	I believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your	52.98165512084961
28044/28840	But monsieur you know then   I know that you have been abducted mad	40.0059928894043
28045/28840	And by whom Do you know him Oh if you know him tell me   By a man of from forty to fortyfive years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left	78.09339141845703
28046/28840	That is he that is he but his name   Ah his name I do not know	43.76355743408203
28047/28840	And did my husband know I had been carried off   He was informed of it by a letter written to him by the abductor	139.7042236328125
28048/28840	Bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event   He attributed it I believe to a political	156.1190185546875
28049/28840	I doubted from the first and now I think entirely as he	191.49310302734375
28050/28840	Then my dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant   So far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your	64.94105529785156
28051/28840	A second smile almost imperceptible stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young	462.15728759765625
28052/28840	But continued DArtagnan how did you escape   I took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as I had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets I let myself down from the	69.5574951171875
28053/28840	Then as I believed my husband would be at home I hastened	155.00021362304688
28054/28840	To place yourself under his protection   Oh no poor dear man I knew very well that he was incapable of defending me but as he could serve us in other ways I wished to inform	133.3421173095703
28055/28840	Of what   Oh that is not my secret I must not therefore tell	58.662803649902344
28056/28840	Besides said DArtagnan pardon me madame if guardsman as I am I remind you of prudencebesides I believe we are not here in a very proper place for imparting conf	352.42376708984375
28057/28840	The men I have put to flight will return reinforced if they find us here we are	272.45068359375

28059/28840	Bonacieux let us fly Let us save	285.5175476074219
28060/28840	At these words she passed her arm under that of DArtagnan and urged him forward	88.78099822998047

28062/28840	The young woman and the young man without taking the trouble to shut the door after them descended the Rue des Fossoyeurs rapidly turned into the Rue des FossésMonsieurlePrince and did not stop till they came to the Place	320.2819519042969
28063/28840	And now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked DArtagn	27.670419692993164
28064/28840	I am at quite a loss how to answer you I admit said M	658.7521362304688
28065/28840	My intention was to inform Monsieur Laporte through my husband in order that Monsieur Laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the Louvre in the last three days and whether there is any danger in presenting myself	56.958702087402344
28066/28840	But I said DArtagnan can go and inform Monsieur Laport	19.38037109375
28067/28840	No doubt you could only there is one misfortune and that is that Monsieur Bonacieux is known at the Louvre and would be allowed to pass whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against	88.69840240478516
28068/28840	Ah bah said DArtagnan you have at some wicket of the Louvre a _concierge_ who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would   M	113.72798919677734
28069/28840	Bonacieux looked earnestly at the young	47.68558883666992
28070/28840	And if I give you this password said she would you forget it as soon as you used it   By my honor by the faith of a gentleman said DArtagnan with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake	95.53575897216797
28071/28840	You appear to be a brave young man besides your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devoted	91.81475830078125
28072/28840	I will do without a promise and voluntarily all that I can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the	91.45275115966797
28073/28840	Dispose of me then as a	193.70103454589844
28074/28840	But Iwhere shall I go meanwhile   Is there nobody from whose house Monsieur Laporte can come and fetch you   No I can trust	144.4434356689453
28075/28840	Stop said DArtagnan we are near Athoss	40.484962463378906
28076/28840	Who is this Athos   One of my	47.587032318115234
28077/28840	But if he should be at home and see me   He is not at home and I will carry away the key after having placed you in his	58.79588317871094
28078/28840	But if he should return   Oh he wont return and if he should he will be told that I have brought a woman with me and that woman is in his	82.29393768310547
28079/28840	But that will compromise me sadly you	408.56146240234375
28080/28840	Besides we are in a situation to overlook	1000.0730590820312
28081/28840	Come then let us go to your friends	73.34117126464844
28082/28840	Where does he live   Rue Férou two steps from	209.3142547607422
28083/28840	Let us go   Both resumed their	218.28932189941406
28084/28840	As DArtagnan had foreseen Athos was not	28.459850311279297
28085/28840	He took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced M	704.7322387695312

28088/28840	Now in my turn let me give you my	73.02996063232422
28089/28840	Present yourself at the wicket of the Louvre on the side of the Rue de lEchelle and ask for Germ	139.81585693359375
28090/28840	Well and then   He will ask you what you want and you will answer by these two words Tours and Bruxell	182.924072265625
28091/28840	He will at once put himself at your	138.3772430419922
28092/28840	And what shall I command him   To go and fetch Monsieur Laporte the queens _valet de chambre	53.94693374633789
28093/28840	And when he shall have informed him and Monsieur Laporte is come   You will send him to	30.926353454589844
28094/28840	That is well but where and how shall I see you again   Do you wish to see me again  	29.665727615356445
28095/28840	Well let that care be mine and be at	586.33837890625
28096/28840	Bonacieux darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person and while he descended the stairs he heard the door closed and double	254.3166046142578
28097/28840	In two bounds he was at the Louvre as he entered the wicket of LEchelle ten oclock	209.70858764648438
28098/28840	All the events we have described had taken place within a half	121.5937271118164
28099/28840	In a few minutes Laporte was at the lodge in two words DArtagnan informed him where M	181.49085998535156
28100/28840	Laporte assured himself by having it twice repeated of the accurate address and set off at a	646.9503173828125
28101/28840	Hardly however had he taken ten steps before he	170.81565856933594
28102/28840	Young man said he to DArtagnan a	96.9373779296875
28103/28840	What   You may get into trouble by what has taken	95.18795013427734
28104/28840	Have you any friend whose clock is too slow   Well   Go and call upon him in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past	161.45986938476562
28105/28840	In a court of justice that is called an al	1081.70751953125
28106/28840	He took to his heels and was soon at	90.55648040771484
28107/28840	de Trévilles but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to	157.55984497070312
28108/28840	As DArtagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform	422.29632568359375
28109/28840	de Tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private	2049.41259765625
28110/28840	de Tréville was asking DArtagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an	83.8048324584961
28111/28840	Pardon me monsieur said DArtagnan who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back	28.40704917907715
28112/28840	de Trévilles clock threequarters of an hour but I thought as it was yet only twentyfive minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon	160.09686279296875
28113/28840	de Tréville looking at the clock why thats impossible   Look rather monsieur said DArtagnan the clock shows	92.64152526855469
28114/28840	But what can I do for you   Then DArtagnan told	27.35417938232422
28115/28840	de Tréville a long history about the	184.15625
28116/28840	He expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to Buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which	124.84859466552734
28117/28840	de Tréville was the more the dupe from having himself as we have said observed something fresh between the cardinal the king and the	155.46307373046875
28118/28840	As ten oclock was striking DArtagnan left	56.195743560791016
28119/28840	de Tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon but at the foot of the stairs DArtagnan remembered he had forgotten his	94.11640167236328
28120/28840	IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS     His visit to	30366.5625
28121/28840	de Tréville being paid the pensive DArtagnan took the longest way homew	815.057373046875
28122/28840	On what was DArtagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling   He was thinking of M	389.21832275390625
28123/28840	For an apprentice Musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of	1817.7813720703125
28124/28840	Pretty mysterious initiated in almost all the secrets of the court which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved and this is an irresistible charm to novices in	427.0126953125
28125/28840	Moreover DArtagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender	208.57916259765625
28126/28840	DArtagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing a meeting a gold chain or a	207.0728759765625
28127/28840	We have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without	625.0650024414062

28131/28840	DArtagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at Paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in FlandersSpain yonder woman	244.1548614501953
28132/28840	In each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be	354.0412292480469
28133/28840	But we must say at the present moment DArtagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and dis	97.3203125
28134/28840	The mercer had said that he was rich the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as	245.21031188964844
28135/28840	Bonacieux and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of	305.1074523925781
28136/28840	We say _almost_ for the idea that a young handsome kind and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love but on the contrary strengthens	437.856201171875
28137/28840	There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to	1146.3221435546875
28138/28840	In the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a womans happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of noth	738.6520385742188
28139/28840	At least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he cannot offer she offers to herself and although it is generally with her husbands money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to	412.4499206542969
28140/28840	Then DArtagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted	82.48112487792969
28141/28840	In the midst of his amorous projects for the mercers wife he did not forget his	227.22560119628906
28142/28840	Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain	728.8179931640625
28143/28840	Denis or in the fair of	152.36892700195312
28144/28840	Germain in company with Athos Porthos and Aramis to whom DArtagnan had often remarked	24.919445037841797
28145/28840	Then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a	254.76580810546875
28146/28840	Besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties DArtagnan would become the preserver of his	163.51531982421875
28147/28840	Love is the most selfish of all the	164.22567749023438
28148/28840	If DArtagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he	94.66632080078125
28149/28840	But for the moment let us do as did the amorous Gascon we will see after the worthy mercer	287.0523681640625
28150/28840	DArtagnan reflecting on his future amours addressing himself to the beautiful night and smiling at the stars ascended the Rue CherishMidi or ChaseMidi as it was then	1963.5897216796875
28151/28840	This mystery required an explanation at least so DArtagnan declared to	153.66864013671875
28152/28840	He likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little M	2692.201904296875
28153/28840	Bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already	148.0814208984375
28154/28840	We must never look for discretion in first	1721.3634033203125

28156/28840	Paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a	184.03817749023438
28157/28840	Eleven oclock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg	142.05799865722656
28158/28840	From a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the	1326.78076171875
28159/28840	Arrived at the end of the lane DArtagnan turned to the	43.47440719604492
28160/28840	The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandon	461.50628662109375
28161/28840	This something was enveloped in a cloak and DArtagnan at first believed it was a man but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a	90.2728042602539
28162/28840	Further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned	338.8046569824219
28163/28840	Shall I go and offer her my services thought	177.8311767578125
28164/28840	By her step she must be young perhaps she is	307.7162170410156
28165/28840	Oh yes But a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her	693.4600830078125
28166/28840	If I should disturb a rendezvous that would not be the best means of commencing an	97.01696014404297
28167/28840	Meantime the young woman continued to advance counting the houses and	403.1076965332031
28168/28840	There were but three hôtels in this part of the street and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis occupied the other belonging to Aramis	180.17449951171875
28169/28840	_Pardieu_ said DArtagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted _pardieu_ it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friends	178.31092834472656
28170/28840	But on my soul it looks	345.2921447753906
28171/28840	Ah my dear Aramis this time I shall find you	40.844207763671875
28172/28840	And DArtagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a	94.26663970947266
28173/28840	The young woman continued to advance and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet	355.8328552246094
28174/28840	DArtagnan believed this cough to be a	110.24681091308594
28175/28840	This is all very fine dear Aramis murmured DArtagn	23.00775146484375
28176/28840	Ah Monsieur Hypocrite I understand how you study	3809.919189453125
28177/28840	The three blows were scarcely struck when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside	558.673583984375
28178/28840	Ah ah said the listener not through doors but through windows Ah this visit was	1996.19384765625
28179/28840	We shall see the windows open and the lady enter by escal	2263.0888671875
28180/28840	Very pretty   But to the great astonishment of DArtagnan the shutter remained	75.59915924072266
28181/28840	Still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in	122.99131774902344
28182/28840	DArtagnan thought this could not last long and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his	67.60317993164062
28183/28840	He was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard	745.4985961914062
28184/28840	The young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little	155.940673828125
28185/28840	It may be judged whether DArtagnan looked or listened with av	210.39297485351562
28186/28840	Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the	60.68419647216797
28187/28840	Besides the eyes of the Gascons have as it is asserted like those of cats the faculty of seeing in the	138.2095489501953
28188/28840	DArtagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handker	69.24882507324219
28189/28840	She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded	3936.092041015625
28190/28840	This immediately recalled to DArtagnans mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of M	99.29828643798828
28191/28840	Bonacieux which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of Aram	63.9976806640625
28192/28840	What the devil could that handkerchief signify   Placed where he was DArtagnan could not perceive the face of Aram	95.18944549560547
28193/28840	We say Aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the	119.53394317626953
28194/28840	At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to	79.5105972290039
28195/28840	Then some words were spoken by the two	98.5908203125
28196/28840	The woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of DArtagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle but the precaution was too late DArtagnan had already recognized M	171.39248657226562
28197/28840	Bonacieux The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of DArtagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket but what probability was there that M	156.82484436035156
28198/28840	But was it on her own account or on account of another that she exposed herself to such hazards This was a question the young man asked himself whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted	334.7021484375
28199/28840	There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither M	2283.68408203125
28200/28840	Bonacieux was going that was to follow	115.9217529296875
28201/28840	This method was so simple that DArtagnan employed it quite naturally and	194.46249389648438
28202/28840	But at the sight of the young man who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her M	195.99114990234375
28203/28840	Bonacieux uttered a little cry and	141.30189514160156
28204/28840	It was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her	282.9114685058594
28205/28840	He came up with her before she had traversed a third of the	75.2283706665039
28206/28840	Bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world but the voice was	138.81739807128906
28207/28840	Was it with that intention you followed me asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an	159.1145477294922
28208/28840	No said DArtagnan no I confess	30.35544776916504
28209/28840	It was chance that threw me in your way I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my	91.59519958496094
28210/28840	Without doubt Aramis is one of my best	62.80404281616211

28212/28840	It is the first time then that you ever went to that house   Und	50.348201751708984
28213/28840	And you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man  	28.807334899902344
28214/28840	By a Musketeer   No indeed   It was not he then you came to seek   Not the least in the	42.699546813964844

28218/28840	My dear Madame Bonacieux you are charming but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious	77.91548156738281
28219/28840	Do I lose by that   No you are on the contrary	125.6268310546875

28223/28840	Shall I wait for you   That will be	41.418426513671875
28224/28840	You will return alone then   Perhaps yes perhaps	202.524169921875

28227/28840	Why so   I do not want	19.06633758544922
28228/28840	But you have claimed   The aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a	165.64193725585938

28230/28840	Well madame I perceive I must do as you	44.15919876098633
28231/28840	Why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once   Is there no merit in repentance   And do you really repent   I know nothing about it	85.89862823486328
28232/28840	But what I know is that I promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are	38.430564880371094

28257/28840	This is the second or third time monsieur that you have repeated that name and yet I have told you that I do not know	35.352195739746094
28258/28840	You do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked Indeed madame you believe me too credulous   Confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this person	357.7476806640625
28259/28840	I invent nothing madame I create	808.5386962890625

28264/28840	You speak very suddenly of love monsieur said the young woman shaking her	57.72284698486328
28265/28840	That is because love has come suddenly upon me and for the first time and because I am only	194.6322784423828
28266/28840	The young woman looked at him furt	167.5557861328125
28267/28840	Listen I am already upon the scent resumed DArtagn	57.438865661621094

28269/28840	Monsieur said the young woman you weary me very much I assure you with your	64.7686767578125
28270/28840	But you madame prudent as you are think if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief and that handkerchief were to be seized would you not be compromised   In what way The initials are only mine	252.615234375

28277/28840	Ah I wish I had never seen you cried DArtagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over	377.1068420410156
28278/28840	Bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of DArtagnan who had not relinquished hers well I will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost	90.22718048095703
28279/28840	Who knows when I shall be at liberty that I may not satisfy your curiosity   And will you make the same promise to my love cried DArtagnan beside himself with	68.18523406982422
28280/28840	Oh as to that I do not engage	78.95223236083984

28291/28840	A man   The discussion is going to begin again said M	485.1942443847656

28298/28840	He had given his word not to watch M	1332.9908447265625

28300/28840	Five minutes later he was in the Rue des Fossoye	110.4610366821289
28301/28840	Poor Athos said he he will never guess what all this	169.36962890625
28302/28840	He will have fallen asleep waiting for me or else he will have returned home where he will have learned that a woman had been	114.69383239746094
28303/28840	A woman with Athos After all continued DArtagnan there was certainly one with Aram	106.9997329711914

28306/28840	How badly What do you mean by that you idiot asked DArtagn	76.14186096191406

28310/28840	And by whom was he arrested   By Guards brought by the men in black whom you put to	579.4247436523438
28311/28840	They will believe he is arrested and that will give him time in three days I will tell them who I am and they cannot fail to let me	91.2361831665039
28312/28840	I know him well there And what did the officers do   Four conveyed him away I dont know whereto the Bastille or Fort lEvê	574.8215942382812

28314/28840	The last two mounted guard at the door during this examination then when all was over they went away leaving the house empty and	362.4562683105469
28315/28840	And Porthos and Aramis   I could not find them they did not	17.772493362426758

28318/28840	Let them wait for me at the Pommede	4203.52783203125
28319/28840	Here it would be dangerous the house may be	131.55010986328125
28320/28840	I will run to Monsieur de Tréville to tell them all this and will meet them	30.2084903717041
28321/28840	But you will remain you are not afraid said DArtagnan coming back to recommend courage to his lac	65.10175323486328
28322/28840	Be easy monsieur said Planchet you do not know me	19.71337890625
28323/28840	I am brave when I set about	135.61300659179688
28324/28840	Then it is understood said DArtagnan you would rather be killed than desert your post   Yes monsieur and there is nothing I would not do to prove to Monsieur that I am attached to	40.91304397583008
28325/28840	It appears that the method I have adopted with this boy is decidedly the	311.41845703125
28326/28840	I shall use it again upon	1781.109130859375
28327/28840	And with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day DArtagnan directed his course toward	183.2567138671875
28328/28840	de Tréville was not at his hô	209.3472137451172
28329/28840	His company was on guard at the Louvre he was at the Louvre with his	49.30451965332031
28330/28840	de Tréville it was important that he should be informed of what was	59.41388702392578
28331/28840	DArtagnan resolved to try and enter the Lou	30.608545303344727
28332/28840	His costume of Guardsman in the company of	794.3677368164062
28333/28840	He therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the New	176.53196716308594
28334/28840	He had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry but on gaining the riverside he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his	163.96473693847656
28335/28840	As he gained the top of the Rue Guénegaud he saw two persons coming out of the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck	247.23924255371094
28336/28840	Of the two persons who composed this group one was a man and the other a	132.80516052246094
28337/28840	The woman had the outline of M	1612.4036865234375
28338/28840	Bonacieux the man resembled Aramis so much as to be mistaken for	84.87760925292969
28339/28840	Besides the woman wore that black mantle which DArtagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of the Rue de la Harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a Musket	150.19017028808594
28340/28840	The womans hood was pulled down and the man held a handkerchief to his	181.8639678955078
28341/28840	Both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being	636.4964599609375
28342/28840	That was DArtagnans road as he was going to the Lou	34.91709899902344
28343/28840	He had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really M	437.46533203125
28344/28840	Bonacieux and that the man was Aram	33.716941833496094
28345/28840	He felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his	419.1280822753906
28346/28840	He felt himself doubly betrayed by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a	274.034912109375
28347/28840	Bonacieux had declared to him by all the gods that she did not know Aramis and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of Aram	49.83625030517578
28348/28840	DArtagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercers pretty wife for three hours that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him	145.14013671875
28349/28840	He considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed	9007.62109375
28350/28840	Blood and anger mounted to his face he was resolved to unravel the	254.1250762939453
28351/28840	The young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their	169.90219116210938
28352/28840	He passed them then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the	436.18865966796875
28353/28840	DArtagnan stopped before them and they stopped before	32.6390266418457
28354/28840	What do you want monsieur demanded the Musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to DArtagnan that he was deceived in one of his conject	110.89093780517578
28355/28840	No monsieur it is not Aramis and by your exclamation I perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon	57.697669982910156
28356/28840	Allow me then to pass on since it is not with me you have anything to	73.14360046386719
28357/28840	You are right monsieur it is not with you that I have anything to do it is with	28.84893226623535
28358/28840	With Madame You do not know her replied the	161.27804565429688

28360/28840	Bonacieux in a tone of reproach ah monsieur I had your promise as a soldier and your word as a	62.71306228637695
28361/28840	I hoped to be able to rely upon	49.006526947021484
28362/28840	And I madame said DArtagnan embarrassed you promised me   Take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our	38.61566162109375
28363/28840	DArtagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the Musketeer and M	316.1959228515625
28364/28840	The Musketeer advanced two steps and pushed DArtagnan aside with his	177.46905517578125
28365/28840	DArtagnan made a spring backward and drew his	61.88019943237305
28366/28840	At the same time and with the rapidity of lightning the stranger drew	42.28046417236328

28377/28840	Fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any	161.02484130859375

28391/28840	She then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a	96.9408950805664
28392/28840	Nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the Duke of Buckingham did not experience an instant of	134.3946533203125
28393/28840	One of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of	620.1469116210938

28402/28840	At this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman	57.87142562866211
28403/28840	Buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered a	427.519775390625

28405/28840	Her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess her eyes which cast the brilliancy of emeralds were perfectly beautiful and yet were at the same time full of sweetness and	205.9447021484375

28427/28840	Duke said the queen blushing never speak of that	131.68951416015625
28428/28840	Then you were about to tell me allthe isolation of your life the griefs of your	126.72254943847656

28432/28840	For that night madame that night you loved me I will swear	125.10525512695312
28433/28840	At the first word you dared to utter at the first freedom to which I had to reply I called for	194.49114990234375
28434/28840	And any other love but mine would have sunk beneath this ordeal but my love came out from it more ardent and more	1260.1380615234375
28435/28840	You believed that you would fly from me by returning to Paris you believed that I would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to	120.03451538085938

28448/28840	All these proofs of love which you would give me are almost	226.29873657226562

28458/28840	Oh my God cried Anne of Austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to	82.72277069091797

28481/28840	Buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand and then rising said Within six months if I am not dead I shall have seen you again madameeven if I have to overturn the	466.1133117675781
28482/28840	And faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the	62.22407531738281

28487/28840	The officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the Bastille where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their musk	516.8430786132812
28488/28840	Thence introduced into a halfsubterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest	884.9035034179688

28490/28840	At the end of half an hour or thereabouts a clerk came to put an end to his tortures but not to his anxiety by giving the order to conduct	128.96327209472656
28491/28840	Ordinarily prisoners were interrogated in their cells but they did not do so with	600.4788818359375
28492/28840	The commissary was seated in the chair and was writing at the	59.51667404174805
28493/28840	The two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear	75.49573516845703
28494/28840	The commissary who had till this time held his head down over his papers looked up to see what sort of person he had to do	85.57496643066406
28495/28840	This commissary was a man of very repulsive mien with a pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the	1132.865966796875
28496/28840	His head supported by a long and flexible neck issued from his large black robe balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his	573.80615234375
28497/28840	Bonacieux his name age condition and ab	539.961181640625
28498/28840	The accused replied that his name was Jacques Michel Bonacieux that he was fiftyone years old a retired mercer and lived Rue des Fossoyeurs	927.2041625976562
28499/28840	The commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public	258.8961486816406
28500/28840	He complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal that incomparable minister that conqueror of past ministers that example for ministers to comedeeds and power which none could thwart with	2440.86181640625
28501/28840	After this second part of his discourse fixing his hawks eye upon poor Bonacieux he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his	584.82861328125
28502/28840	The reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when	957.3427734375
28503/28840	Laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as Lady of the Linen to her	2036.048583984375
28504/28840	Bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice the whole seasoned with extreme coward	788.1359252929688
28505/28840	The love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumer	354.103515625
28506/28840	Bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to	171.77203369140625
28507/28840	But Monsieur Commissary said he calmly believe that I know and appreciate more than anybody the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be	223.31411743164062
28508/28840	Indeed asked the commissary with an air of	58.05126190185547
28509/28840	You must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high	235.462158203125
28510/28840	Of high treason cried Bonacieux terrified of high treason How is it possible for a poor mercer who detests Huguenots and who abhors Spaniards to be accused of high treason Consider monsieur the thing is absolutely	887.506591796875
28511/28840	What you _had_ one What have you done with her then if you have her no longer   They have abducted her monsie	235.54615783691406
28512/28840	They have abducted her Ah   Bonacieux inferred from this Ah that the affair grew more and more	2116.387451171875
28513/28840	They have abducted her added the commissary and do you know the man who has committed this deed   I think I know	102.3858871459961

28520/28840	The commissary now appeared to experience a little uneas	138.78814697265625
28521/28840	Oh as to his name I know nothing about it but if I were ever to meet him I should recognize him in an instant I will answer for it were he among a thousand	56.06053161621094
28522/28840	The face of the commissary grew still	120.30487060546875
28523/28840	You should recognize him among a thousand say you continued	365.4884338378906
28524/28840	That is to say cried Bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say   You have answered that you should recognize him said the commiss	54.4406623840332
28525/28840	That is all very well and enough for today before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your	283.219482421875
28526/28840	But I have not told you that I know him cried Bonacieux in	65.82679748535156
28527/28840	I told you on the contrary   Take away the prisoner said the commissary to the two	40.32911682128906
28528/28840	Where must we place him demanded the	675.4747314453125
28529/28840	Which   Good Lord In the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor Bonacieux with	306.96820068359375
28530/28840	Alas alas said he to himself misfortune is over my head my wife must have committed some frightful	274.6460876464844
28531/28840	They believe me her accomplice and will punish me with	213.36813354492188
28532/28840	Bonacieuxlamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomedthe two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in	269.8581848144531
28533/28840	Bonacieux could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so	94.95701599121094
28534/28840	He sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal t	548.4771118164062
28535/28840	All at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified	606.4876098632812
28536/28840	He believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them	110.57671356201172
28537/28840	Your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening my good man and I advise you to tell the whole truth for your repentance alone can remove the anger of the	250.8080291748047
28538/28840	Why I am ready to tell everything cried Bonacieux at least all that I	102.57402801513672
28539/28840	Interrogate me I entreat you   Where is your wife in the first place   Why did not I tell you she had been stolen from me   Yes but yesterday at five oclock in the afternoon thanks to you she	67.18457794189453
28540/28840	Oh unfortunate creature Monsieur if she has escaped it is not my fault I	73.03768920898438
28541/28840	What was the aim of that visit   To beg him to assist me in finding my	152.93370056152344
28542/28840	I believed I had a right to endeavor to find	105.63928985595703
28543/28840	I was deceived as it appears and I ask your	99.3357925415039
28544/28840	And what did Monsieur dArtagnan reply   Monsieur dArtagnan promised me his assistance but I soon found out that he was betraying	42.52116012573242
28545/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan made a compact with you and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond	208.9029541015625
28546/28840	dArtagnan has abducted my wife Come now what are you telling me   Fortunately Monsieur dArtagnan is in our hands and you shall be confronted with	97.23319244384766
28547/28840	By my faith I ask no better cried Bonacieux I shall not be sorry to see the face of an	63.314971923828125

28549/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan said the commissary addressing Athos declare all that passed yesterday between you and Monsie	42.170814514160156
28550/28840	But cried Bonacieux this is not Monsieur dArtagnan whom you show	39.41560745239258
28551/28840	What Not Monsieur dArtagnan exclaimed the commiss	17.00341796875
28552/28840	Not the least in the world replied Bonacie	97.13717651367188
28553/28840	What is this gentlemans name asked the commiss	97.43012237548828
28554/28840	I cannot tell you I dont know	32.7540397644043
28555/28840	How You dont know him  	32.56327438354492
28556/28840	Did you never see him   Yes I have seen him but I dont know what he calls	24.12724494934082
28557/28840	But that is not a mans name that is the name of a mountain cried the poor questioner who began to lose his	63.80677795410156
28558/28840	That is my name said Athos	77.4439926147461
28559/28840	But you said that your name was DArtagn	23.88292121887207
28560/28840	Somebody said to me You are Monsieur dArtagnan I answered You think so My guards exclaimed that they were sure of	82.8988037109375
28561/28840	I did not wish to contradict them besides I might be	67.21430969238281
28562/28840	Monsieur you insult the majesty of	165.17312622070312
28563/28840	You see monsieur that you say it	64.10283660888672
28564/28840	But I tell you Monsieur Commissary cried Bonacieux in his turn there is not the least doubt about the	76.505615234375
28565/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is my tenant although he does not pay me my rentand even better on that account ought I to know	148.04766845703125
28566/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at	47.61958312988281
28567/28840	Monsieur dArtagnan is in Monsieur Dessessarts Guards and this gentleman is in the company of Monsieur de Trévilles Musket	137.83737182617188
28568/28840	Look at his uniform Monsieur Commissary look at his uniform   Thats true murmured the commissary _pardieu_ thats	90.13899230957031
28569/28840	At this moment the door was opened quickly and a messenger introduced by one of the gatekeepers of the Bastille gave a letter to the commiss	81.17094421386719
28570/28840	How What do you say Of whom do you speak It is not of my wife I hope   On the contrary it is of	47.526180267333984
28571/28840	The commissary designated by the same gesture Athos and Bonacieux Let them be guarded more closely than	179.83563232421875
28572/28840	And yet said Athos with his habitual calmness if it be Monsieur dArtagnan who is concerned in this matter I do not perceive how I can take his	35.81239318847656
28573/28840	Do as I bade you cried the commissary and preserve absolute	453.3160400390625
28574/28840	You understand   Athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently while	107.56161499023438
28575/28840	Bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a	396.60076904296875
28576/28840	They locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night and left him to himself during the	126.68659973144531
28577/28840	Bonacieux wept all day like a true mercer not being at all a military man as he himself informed	369.33026123046875
28578/28840	In the evening about nine oclock at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed he heard steps in his	50.858795166015625
28579/28840	These steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards	154.34962463378906
28580/28840	Follow me said an officer who came up behind the	136.74110412597656
28581/28840	Follow you cried Bonacieux follow you at this hour Where my God   Where we have orders to lead	157.93707275390625
28582/28840	It is nevertheless the only one we can	179.21157836914062
28583/28840	Ah my God my God murmured the poor mercer now indeed I am lost And he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without	254.4422607421875
28584/28840	He passed along the same corridor as before crossed one court then a second side of a building at length at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horse	139.77719116210938
28585/28840	They made him enter this carriage the officer placed himself by his side the door was locked and they were left in a rolling	118.57765197753906
28586/28840	The carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral	722.8222045898438
28587/28840	Through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement that was all but true Parisian as he was Bonacieux could recognize every street by the milestones the signs and the	466.7289123535156
28588/28840	At the moment of arriving at	268.3600158691406
28589/28840	Paulthe spot where such as were condemned at the Bastille were executedhe was near fainting and crossed himself	772.2326049804688
28590/28840	He thought the carriage was about to stop	97.39273071289062
28591/28840	Farther on a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of	529.4262084960938
28592/28840	One thing however reassured him he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off and he felt that his head was still on his	119.21755981445312
28593/28840	But when he saw the carriage take the way to La Grêve when he perceived the pointed roof of the Hôtel de Ville and the carriage passed under the arcade he believed it was over with	122.25067901611328
28594/28840	He wished to confess to the officer and upon his refusal uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus he should put a gag in his	303.7662658691406
28595/28840	If they meant to execute him at La Grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of	284.2016296386719
28596/28840	Indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without	306.03094482421875
28597/28840	There remained then no other place to fear but the Traitors Cross the carriage was taking the direct road to	916.8599853515625
28598/28840	This time there was no longer any doubt it was at the Traitors Cross that lesser criminals were	1075.5684814453125
28599/28840	Bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of	294.8038635253906
28600/28840	Paul or of the Place de Grêve it was at the Traitors Cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end He could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet	393.61126708984375
28601/28840	When he was within twenty paces of it he heard a noise of people and the carriage	57.15693283081055
28602/28840	This was more than poor Bonacieux could endure depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man and f	136.17308044433594
28603/28840	THE MAN OF MEUNG     The crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was	361.8913879394531
28604/28840	The carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the Rue	460.6256103515625
28605/28840	Honoré turned into the Rue des Bons Enfants and stopped before a low	110.95726013183594
28606/28840	The door opened two guards received Bonacieux in their arms from the officer who supported	200.8148651123047
28607/28840	They carried him through an alley up a flight of stairs and deposited him in an antech	123.60247039794922
28608/28840	All these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was	307.5938415527344
28609/28840	He had walked as one walks in a dream he had a glimpse of objects as through a	319.0543212890625
28610/28840	His ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore	231.38804626464844
28611/28840	He remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed	87.69744110107422
28612/28840	At this movement which nobody opposed he resumed a little courage and ventured to draw up one leg and then the	370.0965881347656
28613/28840	At length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his	61.97114562988281
28614/28840	At this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the	104.70845031738281
28615/28840	Yes Monsieur Officer stammered the mercer more dead than alive at your	150.48623657226562
28616/28840	And he moved out of the way to let the mercer	441.4162292480469
28617/28840	The latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be	157.8367919921875
28618/28840	It was a large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already a fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of	214.37673950195312
28619/28840	A square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of La Rochelle occupied the center of the	362.7278747558594
28620/28840	Although this man was scarcely thirtysix or thirtyseven years of age hair mustaches and royal all began to be	465.635009765625
28621/28840	This man except a sword had all the appearance of a soldier and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the	148.31143188476562
28622/28840	At first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they	102.25040435791016
28623/28840	The poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the	111.6094741821289
28624/28840	Is this that Bonacieux asked he after a moment of	156.82244873046875
28625/28840	Give me those papers and leave	481.6772155761719
28626/28840	The officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and	162.14971923828125
28627/28840	Bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the Bast	690.3433227539062
28628/28840	From time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mer	182.47743225097656
28629/28840	At the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was	200.33712768554688
28630/28840	That head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not we will	228.47560119628906
28631/28840	You are accused of high treason said the cardinal	325.62347412109375
28632/28840	So I have been told already monseigneur cried Bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but I swear to you that I know nothing about	72.51378631591797
28633/28840	You have conspired with your wife with Madame de Chevreuse and with my Lord Duke of	117.88152313232422
28634/28840	Indeed monseigneur responded the mercer I have heard her pronounce all those	376.58502197265625
28635/28840	And on what occasion   She said that the Cardinal de Richelieu had drawn the Duke of Buckingham to Paris to ruin him and to ruin the	67.92008972167969
28636/28840	She said that cried the cardinal with	251.3514404296875
28637/28840	Yes monseigneur but I told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his Eminence was incapable   Hold your tongue You are stupid replied the	113.30199432373047
28638/28840	Thats exactly what my wife said monseign	263.517822265625
28639/28840	Do you know who carried off your wife   No monseign	51.16635513305664
28640/28840	You have suspicions nevertheless   Yes monseigneur but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to Monsieur the Commissary and I no longer have	103.08494567871094
28641/28840	Did you know that   No monseign	18.76519775390625
28642/28840	I learned it since I have been in prison and that from the conversation of Monsieur the Commissaryan amiable	145.61631774902344
28643/28840	Then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her	58.08333206176758
28644/28840	Absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the Lou	49.454471588134766
28645/28840	At one oclock this morning she had not	58.69834518432617
28646/28840	My God What can have become of her then   We shall know be	97.4141845703125
28647/28840	Nothing is concealed from the cardinal the cardinal knows	227.85751342773438
28648/28840	But monseigneur I know nothing about them I have never seen	26.59681510925293
28649/28840	When you went to fetch your wife from the Louvre did you always return directly home   Scarcely ever she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses I conducted	454.65234375
28650/28840	And how many were there of these linen drapers   Two monseign	309.76092529296875
28651/28840	And where did they live   One in Rue de Vaugirard the other Rue de la Har	229.76544189453125
28652/28840	Did you go into these houses with her   Never monseigneur I waited at the	69.98360443115234
28653/28840	And what excuse did she give you for entering all alone   She gave me none she told me to wait and I	227.5648956298828
28654/28840	You are a very complacent husband my dear Monsieur Bonacieux said the	73.20288848876953
28655/28840	He calls me his dear Monsieur said the mercer to	203.85745239257812
28656/28840	Should you know those doors again  	199.54525756835938

28659/28840	At these words he took up a silver bell and rang it the officer	156.51011657714844
28660/28840	Go said he in a subdued voice and find Roche	160.83645629882812
28661/28840	Tell him to come to me immediately if he has	108.48213195800781
28662/28840	The count is here said the officer and requests to speak with your Eminence	368.5716552734375
28663/28840	Let him come in then said the cardinal	158.5937957763672
28664/28840	The officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying	146.00267028808594
28665/28840	To your Eminence murmured Bonacieux rolling his eyes round in aston	178.2855987548828
28666/28840	Five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage	147.75717163085938
28667/28840	Place this man in the care of his guards again and let him wait till I send for	84.90071868896484
28668/28840	No monseigneur no it is not he cried Bonacieux no I was	90.56840515136719
28669/28840	This is quite another man and does not resemble him at	109.91240692138672

28671/28840	Take away that fool said the	223.7494354248047
28672/28840	The officer took Bonacieux by the arm and led him into the antechamber where he found his two	54.58075714111328
28673/28840	The newly introduced personage followed Bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out and the moment the door closed They have seen each other said he approaching the cardinal	252.6256103515625
28674/28840	The queen and the duke cried Richel	80.30132293701172
28675/28840	Are you sure of it   Perfectly	53.18695831298828
28676/28840	Who told you of it   Madame de Lannoy who is devoted to your Eminence as you	302.4283447265625
28677/28840	Why did she not let me know sooner   Whether by chance or mistrust the queen made Madame de Surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all	699.517822265625
28678/28840	Well we are beaten Now let us try to take our	182.41452026367188
28679/28840	I will assist you with all my heart monseigneur be assured of	55.177894592285156
28680/28840	How did it come about   At half past twelve the queen was with her women   Where   In her bedchamber   Go	113.84024810791016
28681/28840	When someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laund	416.9652404785156
28682/28840	And then   The queen immediately exhibited strong emotion and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale   And then and then   She then arose and with altered voice Ladies said she wait for me ten minutes I shall soon	338.85797119140625
28683/28840	She then opened the door of her alcove and went	93.78524017333984
28684/28840	Why did not Madame de Lannoy come and inform you instantly   Nothing was certain besides her Majesty had said Ladies wait for me and she did not dare to disobey the	471.5289611816406
28685/28840	How long did the queen remain out of the chamber   Threequarters of an	150.51939392089844
28686/28840	None of her women accompanied her   Only Donna Estaf	6906.56787109375
28687/28840	Did she afterward return   Yes but only to take a little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again	214.3249053955078
28688/28840	And when she finally returned did she bring that casket with her  	289.4720764160156
28689/28840	Does Madame de Lannoy know what was in that casket   Yes the diamond studs which his Majesty gave the	683.8065795898438
28690/28840	And she came back without this casket  	102.39253234863281
28691/28840	Madame de Lannoy then is of opinion that she gave them to Buckingham   She is sure of	455.48583984375
28692/28840	How can she be so   In the course of the day Madame de Lannoy in her quality of tirewoman of the queen looked for this casket appeared uneasy at not finding it and at length asked information of the	435.95892333984375
28693/28840	And then the queen   The queen became exceedingly red and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs she had sent it to her goldsmith to be	303.4334411621094
28694/28840	He must be called upon and so ascertain if the thing be true or	272.7548828125
28695/28840	And the goldsmith   The goldsmith has heard nothing of	652.3615112304688
28696/28840	Well well Rochefort all is not lost and perhapsperhaps everything is for the	164.5506591796875
28697/28840	The fact is that I do not doubt your Eminences genius   Will repair the blunders of his agentis that it   That is exactly what I was going to say if your Eminence had let me finish my	245.69287109375
28698/28840	Meanwhile do you know where the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of Buckingham are now concealed   No monseigneur my people could tell me nothing on that	84.31407928466797
28699/28840	You monseigneur   Yes or at least I	28.658647537231445
28700/28840	They were one in the Rue de Vaugirard	77.3776626586914
28701/28840	25 the other in the Rue de la Harpe	223.4252166748047
28702/28840	Does your Eminence command that they both be instantly arrested   It will be too late they will be	168.88284301757812
28703/28840	But still we can make sure that they are	145.90301513671875
28704/28840	Take ten men of my Guardsmen and search the two houses	2711.54248046875
28705/28840	And Rochefort went hastily out of the	160.40817260742188
28706/28840	The cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third	176.88206481933594
28707/28840	Bring the prisoner in again said the	244.57156372070312
28708/28840	Bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer	197.31558227539062
28709/28840	You have deceived me said the cardinal stern	278.10107421875
28710/28840	I cried Bonacieux I deceive your Eminence   Your wife in going to Rue de Vaugirard and Rue de la Harpe did not go to find linen drap	444.9788513183594
28711/28840	Then why did she go just God   She went to meet the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of	105.18334197998047
28712/28840	Yes cried Bonacieux recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances yes thats	379.3077392578125
28713/28840	I told my wife several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in such houses as those in houses that had no signs but she always laughed at	637.59765625
28714/28840	The cardinal has touched me with his hand I have touched the hand of the great man cried Bonacie	119.92255401611328
28715/28840	The great man has called me his friend   Yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him and as you have been unjustly suspected well you must be indemn	193.55931091308594
28716/28840	Here take this purse of a hundred pistoles and pardon	70.9111328125
28717/28840	I pardon you monseigneur said Bonacieux hesitating to take the purse fearing doubtless that this pretended gift was but a pleasant	268.6903991699219
28718/28840	But you are able to have me arrested you are able to have me tortured you are able to have me hanged you are the master and I could not have the least word to	107.24742126464844
28719/28840	Pardon you monseigneur You cannot mean that   Ah my dear Monsieur Bonacieux you are generous in this	58.011444091796875
28720/28840	I see it and I thank you for	35.792694091796875
28721/28840	Thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too mal	265.25970458984375
28722/28840	Farewell then or rather _au revoir_ for I hope we shall meet	369.5625915527344
28723/28840	Whenever Monseigneur wishes I am always at at his Eminences	303.5994567871094
28724/28840	That will be frequently I assure you for I have found something extremely agreeable in your	157.5293426513672
28725/28840	Oh Monseigneur   _Au revoir_ Monsieur Bonacieux _au revoir_   And the cardinal made him a sign with his hand to which Bonacieux replied by bowing to the	64.14677429199219
28726/28840	Bonacieux and then when Bonacieuxs cries were no longer audible Good said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for	210.44674682617188
28727/28840	As he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations the door opened and Rochefort	135.63111877441406
28728/28840	Well said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the	105.13109588623047
28729/28840	Well said the latter a young woman of about twentysix or twentyeight years of age and a man of from thirtyfive to forty have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your Eminence but the woman left last night and the man this	183.86636352539062
28730/28840	It was they cried the cardinal looking at the clock and now it is too late to have them	82.68448638916016
28731/28840	The duchess is at Tours and the duke at Boulog	65.07682800292969
28732/28840	It is in London they must be	106.28157043457031
28733/28840	What are your Eminences orders   Not a word of what has	297.2169494628906
28734/28840	Let the queen remain in perfect security let her be ignorant that we know her	581.6472778320312
28735/28840	Let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or	118.4705581665039
28736/28840	Send me the keeper of the seals Ségu	969.9619140625
28737/28840	And that man what has your Eminence done with him   What man asked the	173.99301147460938
28738/28840	I have done with him all that could be	36.518531799316406
28739/28840	I have made him a spy upon his	57.32197570800781
28740/28840	The Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and	95.75965881347656
28741/28840	Left alone the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter which he secured with his special	472.03582763671875
28742/28840	The officer entered for the fourth	243.60238647460938
28743/28840	Tell Vitray to come to me said he and tell him to get ready for a	153.7401885986328
28744/28840	An instant after the man he asked for was before him booted and	939.4319458007812
28745/28840	Vitray said he you will go with all speed to	160.9557647705078
28746/28840	You must not stop an instant on the	69.86460876464844
28747/28840	You will deliver this letter to Mil	311.8593444824219
28748/28840	Here is an order for two hundred pistoles call upon my treasurer and get the	189.9234619140625
28749/28840	You shall have as much again if you are back within six days and have executed your commission	339.1701354980469
28750/28840	The messenger without replying a single word bowed took the letter with the order for the two hundred pistoles and	82.84514617919922
28751/28840	Here is what the letter contained   MILADY Be at the first ball at which the Duke of Buckingham shall be	1010.9660034179688
28752/28840	He will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs get as near to him as you can and cut off	409.3280029296875
28753/28840	As soon as these studs shall be in your possession inform	336.72637939453125
28754/28840	MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD     On the day after these events had taken place Athos not having reappeared	6034.4345703125
28755/28840	de Tréville was informed by DArtagnan and Porthos of the	19.7373046875
28756/28840	As to Aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to Rouen on family	202.90879821777344
28757/28840	de Tréville was the father of his	78.74030303955078
28758/28840	The lowest or the least known of them as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own	77.58840942382812
28759/28840	He repaired then instantly to the office of the _lieutenantcriminel	2482.38525390625
28760/28840	The officer who commanded the post of the Red Cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that Athos was then lodged in Fort lEvê	1489.24072265625
28761/28840	Athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen Bonacieux	492.62255859375
28762/28840	We were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each	349.0641174316406
28763/28840	Athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that DArtagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was Athos and not DArtagn	78.58726501464844
28764/28840	He added that he did not know either	61.62796401977539
28765/28840	Bonacieux that he had never spoken to the one or the other that he had come at about ten oclock in the evening to pay a visit to his friend	29.372224807739258
28766/28840	dArtagnan but that till that hour he had been at	165.51466369628906
28767/28840	Twenty witnesses added he could attest the fact and he named several distinguished gentlemen and among them was	1419.5419921875
28768/28840	de la Trémouille commanded a little	1892.5989990234375
28769/28840	Athos was then sent to the cardinal but unfortunately the cardinal was at the Louvre with the	65.22815704345703
28770/28840	It was precisely at this moment that	67.9906997680664
28771/28840	de Tréville on leaving the residence of the _lieutenantcriminel_ and the governor of Fort lEvêque without being able to find Athos arrived at the	228.7239227294922
28772/28840	de Tréville had the right of entry at all	79.4778823852539
28773/28840	It is well known how violent the kings prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than	505.3904724121094
28774/28840	One of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of Anne of Austria for M	391.2398681640625
28775/28840	These two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with Spain the quarrel with England or the embarrassment of the	188.15707397460938
28776/28840	In his eyes and to his conviction M	1144.3482666015625
28777/28840	de Chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues but what tormented him still more in her amorous intrig	193.3045654296875
28778/28840	At the first word the cardinal spoke of M	787.2476196289062
28779/28840	de Chevreusewho though exiled to Tours and believed to be in that city had come to Paris remained there five days and outwitted the policethe king flew into a furious	1006.1654663085938
28780/28840	Capricious and unfaithful the king wished to be called Louis the Just and Louis the Ch	960.5087280273438
28781/28840	Posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by	2072.22900390625
28782/28840	But when the cardinal added that not only M	1025.864013671875
28783/28840	could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queens apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless	325.760009765625
28784/28840	And yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of	81.14881134033203
28785/28840	de Tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable	1390.169189453125
28786/28840	Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the kings countenance	130.01596069335938
28787/28840	de Tréville felt himself something like Samson before the Philist	3723.98095703125
28788/28840	had already placed his hand on the knob of the door at the noise of	61.01872634887695
28789/28840	You arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to a certain point could not dissemble I have learned some fine things concerning your Musket	261.3883361816406
28790/28840	And I said Tréville coldly I have some pretty things to tell your Majesty concerning these gowns	543.0581665039062
28791/28840	I have the honor to inform your Majesty continued	149.23912048339844
28792/28840	Athos said the king mechanically yes certainly I know that	378.96875
28793/28840	Let your Majesty remember said Tréville that Monsieur Athos is the Musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so	299.5327453613281
28794/28840	_A propos_ monseigneur continued Tréville addressing the cardinal Monsieur de Cahusac is quite recovered is he not   Thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with	234.50704956054688
28795/28840	We all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our	199.67269897460938
28796/28840	A written examination attests it said the cardinal replying aloud to the mute interrogation of his Majesty and the illtreated people have drawn up the following which I have the honor to present to your	406.697265625
28797/28840	And is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman replied Tréville haught	183.34036254882812
28798/28840	Come come Tréville hold your tongue said the	258.5027770996094
28799/28840	If his Eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my Musketeers said Tréville the justice of Monsieur the Cardinal is so well known that I demand an	126.53427124023438
28800/28840	In the house in which the judicial inquiry was made continued the impassive cardinal there lodges I believe a young Béarnais a friend of the Musket	496.927001953125
28801/28840	I mean a young man whom you patronize Monsieur de Tré	30.30882453918457
28802/28840	Yes your Eminence it is the	100.53778839111328
28803/28840	Do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel   To Athos to a man double his age interrupted Tré	176.35250854492188
28804/28840	Besides DArtagnan passed the evening with	41.7664680480957
28805/28840	Well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with	145.86753845214844
28806/28840	Does your Eminence doubt my word said Tréville with a brow flushed with	727.6651000976562
28807/28840	At what hour did he leave your hôtel   At half past tenan hour after the	558.3814086914062
28808/28840	Well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of Tréville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but Athos _was_ taken in the house in the Rue des Fossoye	135.8747100830078
28809/28840	Is one friend forbidden to visit another or a Musketeer of my company to fraternize with a Guard of Dessessarts company   Yes when the house where he fraternizes is	2004.5008544921875
28810/28840	That house is suspected Tréville said the king perhaps you did not know it   Indeed sire I did	64.89539337158203
28811/28840	Was it not this DArtagnan who wounded Jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the CarmesDéchaussés asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vex	569.7171630859375
28812/28840	Yes sire yes it is the same and your Majesty has a good	120.6690673828125
28813/28840	Come how shall we decide said the	144.62586975097656
28814/28840	That concerns your Majesty more than me said the	563.8104858398438
28815/28840	But his Majesty has judges and these judges will	2500.156494140625
28816/28840	Send the case before the judges it is their business to judge and they shall	315.2328796386719
28817/28840	Only replied Tréville it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live the purest life the most incontestable virtue cannot exempt a man from infamy and	325.1060791015625
28818/28840	The army I will answer for it will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police	358.306640625
28819/28840	de Tréville launched it with knowledge of his	353.57928466796875
28820/28840	He was desirous of an explosion because in that case the mine throws forth fire and fire enlight	335.2030334472656
28821/28840	Police affairs cried the king taking up Trévilles words police affairs And what do you know about them Monsieur Meddle with your Musketeers and do not annoy me in this	414.21563720703125
28822/28840	It appears according to your account that if by mischance a Musketeer is arrested France is in	499.9061279296875
28823/28840	What a noise about a Musketeer I would arrest ten of them _ventrebleu_ a hundred even all the company and I would not allow a	308.8874206542969
